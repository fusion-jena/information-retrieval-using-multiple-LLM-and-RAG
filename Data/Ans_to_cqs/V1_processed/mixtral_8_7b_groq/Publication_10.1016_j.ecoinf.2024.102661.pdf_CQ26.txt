The provided context discusses various aspects of deep learning models, particularly LSTM models, and their optimization using the TPEBO algorithm. However, it does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer based on the given context.

Nevertheless, I can enumerate some common techniques used to tackle data bias in machine learning and deep learning pipelines:

1. Stratified sampling: This technique involves dividing the dataset into strata based on specific features (e.g., gender, age group, or income level) and then ensuring that each stratum is proportionally represented in the training, validation, and test sets. This method helps maintain balance and avoid bias in the data splits.

2. Oversampling: When a particular class or group is underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from that class. This can be done by replicating existing instances or generating synthetic data using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

3. Undersampling: In contrast to oversampling, undersampling reduces the number of instances from the majority class to balance the dataset. However, this method may result in loss of valuable information.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources, perspectives, and demographics can help minimize bias by ensuring that the dataset is representative of the target population.

5. Reweighing: This technique assigns different weights to classes or instances to account for imbalances in the dataset. By adjusting the weights, models can be trained to pay more attention to underrepresented classes or instances.

6. Data augmentation: This method generates new instances by applying transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, or flipping) to the existing data. Data augmentation can help increase the size and diversity of the dataset, reducing the risk of bias.

Please note that these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, but they are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning projects to address data bias during preprocessing.
