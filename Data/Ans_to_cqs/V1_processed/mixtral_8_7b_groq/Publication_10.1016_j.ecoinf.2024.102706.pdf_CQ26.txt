The provided context discusses machine learning algorithms, specifically focusing on bagging and boosting methods, without delving into data preprocessing techniques for addressing data bias in deep learning pipelines. However, I can provide a general explanation of some common techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing stage.



In the context of machine learning and deep learning, data bias can lead to poor model performance and inaccurate predictions. To address data bias during preprocessing, several techniques can be employed, including stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

1. Stratified splitting: Stratified sampling is a method that ensures each subset (training, validation, or testing) has approximately the same percentage of samples for each class as the original dataset. This helps maintain the class distribution and reduces bias in the dataset.

2. Oversampling: Oversampling is a technique that increases the number of instances from the minority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by replicating instances or using synthetic data generation methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Oversampling helps prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

3. Undersampling: Undersampling is the opposite of oversampling, where the number of instances from the majority class is reduced to balance the dataset. This can be done randomly or using more sophisticated methods like Tomek links. Undersampling helps prevent the model from being overwhelmed by the majority class.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting diverse and representative data is crucial for reducing bias. This involves gathering data from various sources, ensuring a balanced representation of different demographics, and avoiding potential biases in the data collection process.

While the provided context does not discuss these techniques explicitly, they are essential for addressing data bias during preprocessing in deep learning pipelines.
