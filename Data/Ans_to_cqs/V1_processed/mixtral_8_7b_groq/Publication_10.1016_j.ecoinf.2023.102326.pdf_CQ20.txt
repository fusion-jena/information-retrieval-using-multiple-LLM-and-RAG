Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The text focuses on discussing the urban acoustic environment (AE) and methods for quantifying its complex properties, including the use of machine learning approaches for sound event classification. However, it does not mention any details about the hardware used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query without additional information.
