I was unable to locate the code repository for the deep learning pipeline in the provided context. The context includes several papers that discuss the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques for various applications in ecology and environmental science, such as land use and land cover classification, habitat suitability analysis, and invasive species detection. However, none of the papers provide information on where the code repository for their deep learning pipeline can be found. It is possible that the code repository is not available on public platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. If you have more information about where the code repository might be located, I would be happy to look for it again.
