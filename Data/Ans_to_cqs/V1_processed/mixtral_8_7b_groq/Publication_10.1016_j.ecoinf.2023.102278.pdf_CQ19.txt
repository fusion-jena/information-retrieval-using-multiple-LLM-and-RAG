The context provided does not give specific information about the deep learning frameworks used to build the model. However, it does mention the use of transfer learning with pre-trained weights from ImageNet, which is a technique commonly implemented in popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. Therefore, it is possible that either TensorFlow or PyTorch (or potentially another framework) was used to build the model.
