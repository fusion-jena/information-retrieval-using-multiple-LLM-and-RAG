The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context are not explicitly mentioned as being similar to the standard image recognition datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the dataset is specifically tailored for land use change classification (LUCC) and spatial modeling (SM) in a particular region.

The training set for the deep learning pipeline consists of a grid with neighborhood features from multiple years (1986, 2005, 2008, 2010, and 2013). These features include land use type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to settlements, distance to roads, distance to rivers, and the 4 neighborhood grid units. The constraint factors for the model are the statistical data and the quantity simulated by the backtracking of the Markov model, which are combined to determine the numbers of different land use types in the year 2000.

The testing set for the model is the data from a certain year, while the remaining data are used for training and validation. The training and validation set is divided into ten parts using the 10-fold cross-validation method.

It is important to note that the purpose of the deep learning model in this context is to determine the probability of the land use distribution, rather than to determine whether a certain land use type exists at a particular time. The probability is used as a basis for the spatial modeling of land use patterns.

Therefore, the dataset used in this deep learning pipeline is specific to the study of land use change classification and spatial modeling, and is not directly comparable to the standard image recognition datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
