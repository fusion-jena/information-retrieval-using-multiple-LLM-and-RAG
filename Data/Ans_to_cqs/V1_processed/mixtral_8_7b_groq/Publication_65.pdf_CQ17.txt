Although the provided context does not explicitly mention specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization, it does describe other techniques used to prevent overfitting and improve generalization in the deep learning pipeline.


The context describes the use of data augmentation as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting and improve the robustness and generalization of the CNN classification. Specifically, rotation, noise, and flip augmentations were used, allowing the dataset to be increased by six times. This data augmentation strategy helps the model to capture multi-scale information and converge to a dilated model that does not downsample the input data.

Additionally, the learning rate was reduced following an exponential decay parameter of 0.5 by an SGD scheduler after 50,000 iterations. This learning rate adjustment can also be considered a form of regularization, as it helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the step size during training, allowing the model to make finer adjustments and find a better balance between the training error and the validation error.

However, the context does not mention any explicit use of dropout or L2 regularization. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the input units to zero during training, preventing over-reliance on individual neurons and improving the model's generalization. L2 regularization, on the other hand, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the model's weights, encouraging smaller weights and reducing the risk of overfitting.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention dropout or L2 regularization, it does describe other regularization techniques such as data augmentation and learning rate adjustment that were used to prevent overfitting and improve generalization in the deep learning pipeline.
