The purpose of the deep learning model in the study mentioned is for classification. Specifically, it is used for classifying acoustic scenes in urban environments. The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that takes as input a 32 × 21 × 4 tensor, which is the result of processing audio data using the librosa library in Python. The CNN then performs a series of mathematical operations on the input data to modify it, with the goal of optimizing the classification performance.

The study mentions that the deep learning model is used in the context of ecoacoustic surveying, which is a method of quantifying ecological communities and their habitats using passive acoustic recording equipment. The model is used to automatically learn features that discriminate different classes in the dataset, without being specified a priori. This is achieved through unsupervised feature learning, as described in the paper by Lee et al. (2009).

The study also mentions that the deep learning model is part of a larger machine learning (ML) pipeline written in Python, which includes pre-processing of the audio data, normalization strategies, and post-processing of the classification results. The ML pipeline was used to classify acoustic scenes in urban environments, and the results were averaged over different normalization schemes to improve network accuracy.

Overall, the deep learning model in this study is used for classification in the context of ecoacoustic surveying, taking advantage of large quantities of training data and unsupervised feature learning to automatically learn features that discriminate different acoustic classes.
