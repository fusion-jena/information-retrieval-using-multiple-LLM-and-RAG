The context provided does not give information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It mentions several studies and models used for fish passage monitoring and object detection, such as SmartShuttle, YOLOv5s, CME-YOLOv5, and CMFTNet. However, it does not specify where or how these models were deployed.

The studies focus on optimizing model performance and computational efficiency, such as reducing memory access and network model layers to improve inference speed. These optimizations could be implemented on various platforms, such as cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform), edge devices, or custom hardware.

In summary, the context does not provide information on the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
