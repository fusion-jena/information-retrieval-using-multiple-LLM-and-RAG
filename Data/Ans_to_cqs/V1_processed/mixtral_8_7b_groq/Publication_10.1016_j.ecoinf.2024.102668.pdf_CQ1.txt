The provided context discusses a specific study related to bioacoustic data collection, particularly focusing on the use of different recorders and sampling protocols. However, it does not directly mention any public datasets or surveys. Therefore, the answer to the query will be based on the information provided regarding data collection methods in this specific study.

In this study, two types of recorders were used: SongMeter and AudioMoth. These recorders were chosen based on their specifications and suitability for the task at hand. The SongMeter had a sampling frequency (FS) of 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz, with a gain of 16 dB. On the other hand, the AudioMoth had a sampling frequency of 48 kHz and a medium gain setting.

The sampling protocol involved collecting 120 hours of audio recordings per site. The study considered the influence of recorders in the sampling design, comparing inter-brand and intra-brand devices. Inter-brand devices consisted of two different brands, with 1988 recordings and a sample scheme of 1 × 15 minutes. Intra-brand devices involved 15 devices of the same brand, with 203 recordings and a sample scheme of 1 × 5 minutes.

The study also emphasized the importance of designing the sampling protocol, taking into account sample duration and its effect on indices, as well as calculating indices in specific time and frequency ranges depending on the sound-space of the habitat. Additionally, the study suggests avoiding temporal subsampling and considering more than just a single portion of the data.

Based on the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for this specific study include using SongMeter and AudioMoth recorders, following a carefully designed sampling protocol, and considering the influence of recorders in the sampling design. However, it is essential to note that these methods might not be generalizable to other studies, as the choice of data collection methods depends on the specific research question and context.
