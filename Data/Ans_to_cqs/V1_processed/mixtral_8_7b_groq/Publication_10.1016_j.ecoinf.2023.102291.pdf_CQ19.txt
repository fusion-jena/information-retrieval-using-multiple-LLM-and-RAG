The deep learning model was built using the TensorFlow framework. This information is provided in the context in the "Materials and Methods" section, where it states that "The CNNs were implemented using TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2016) and Python 3." TensorFlow is a popular open-source framework for building and training machine learning models, and it is well-suited for building convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are a type of deep learning model that is commonly used for image classification tasks. The model training and prediction procedures were executed on Microsoft Azure using the NV12s v3 instance with 12 vCPUs and 112 GB RAM. The Ubuntu 20.04 operating system was used and obtained via the Ubuntu 20.04 Data Science Virtual Machine on Microsoft Azure. The algorithm scripts are available in Supporting Information B.

In addition to TensorFlow, the model was also implemented using Python 3, which is a popular high-level programming language that is commonly used for building and training machine learning models. Python has a large and active community of developers and users, and it offers a wide range of libraries and tools for building and training machine learning models, including TensorFlow.

In summary, the deep learning model was built using the TensorFlow framework and Python 3. These are both popular and widely-used tools for building and training machine learning models, and they are well-suited for building convolutional neural networks, which are a type of deep learning model that is commonly used for image classification tasks.
