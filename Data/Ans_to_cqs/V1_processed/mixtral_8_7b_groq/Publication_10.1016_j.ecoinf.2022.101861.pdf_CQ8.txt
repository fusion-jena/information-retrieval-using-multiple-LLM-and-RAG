The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context focuses on the research about the reproductive biology, territoriality, and dispersal of a specific species, using eBird and Xeno-canto as data sources. The study mentions the use of machine-learning algorithms for bird species identification but does not give details about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
