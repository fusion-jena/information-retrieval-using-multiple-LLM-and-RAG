The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning frameworks were used to build the models. However, it does mention that a stacking-based artificial neural network (ANN) meta model was built using XGB, RF, and ET models, which were chosen based on their best performance and the results of an automl model. ANNs are a type of deep learning model, but the specific frameworks used to build them are not specified in the context. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question without additional information.
