The provided pieces of context do not include information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context includes details about various CNN architectures such as ResNet, Densely Connected Convolutional Networks, and Inception Network, as well as a study on moth species classification using a customized CNN architecture. However, there is no mention of the code repository link for this deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
