I was unable to find a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the BirdNET project directly from the provided context. However, the paper "BirdNET: a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring" by Kahl, S., Wood, C.M., Eibl, M., and Klinck, H. (2021) mentions that the BirdNET project is available as an open-source app, and the machine learning model is implemented in the BirdNET backend.

The BirdNET app is available on GitHub, and the link is provided in the paper "The machine learningâ€“powered BirdNET app reduces barriers to global bird research by enabling citizen science participation" by Wood, C.M., Kahl, S., Rahaman, A., and Klinck, H. (2022). The repository can be found at <https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-App>.

Additionally, the BirdNET model architecture is based on the ResNet model, which was introduced in the paper "Deep residual learning for image recognition" by He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., and Sun, J. (2016). The ResNet code is available on GitHub as well, at <https://github.com/KaimingHe/deep-residual-networks>.

While these repositories may not contain the exact deep learning pipeline used in the BirdNET project, they provide valuable resources for understanding the model architecture and implementation.
