Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix following model training. However, it does describe a multi-step process for adjusting landscape design to improve restorative potential.

After model training, the first step mentioned is a reduction analysis, comparing the results to a baseline. The most significant difference is observed in the boundary region, particularly near buildings. The next step, Iteration II, focuses on increasing tree density in specific areas to enhance restorative potential. This results in slight improvements, particularly in the central areas.

Iteration III introduces water elements into the central area due to the park's lack of water landscapes. However, this also results in a negligible impact.

The overall process involves adjusting the landscape design based on assessment results, using a restorative map to understand design quality, and iteratively improving the design until the desired objectives are achieved. While these steps do not directly correspond to the postprocessing steps asked about in the query, they do provide a framework for improving landscape design based on model assessment.
