The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it does mention a technique used to improve the training of deep neural networks, called "reducing internal covariate shift" (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015). This technique, called Batch Normalization, is used to make the network training process more stable and efficient by normalizing the input layer's activations in each mini-batch.

Additionally, the context discusses strategies to ensure the quality of the training data, such as filtering images based on GPS location, keywords in image metadata, or using high-level AI classifiers to remove non-target images. These strategies aim to minimize the gap between the training data and the test data, ensuring that the model is evaluated on a representative and relevant dataset.

Moreover, the context highlights the importance of considering the appropriate taxonomic resolution for the study and being aware of reporting biases in the dataset. These factors can influence the model's performance and should be taken into account during the training and evaluation process.

In summary, while the context does not directly mention a strategy for monitoring model performance during training, it does provide information on techniques to improve training efficiency, data quality, taxonomic resolution, and reporting biases, all of which contribute to the overall performance and evaluation of the model.
