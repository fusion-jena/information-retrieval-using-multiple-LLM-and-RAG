Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific preprocessing steps (normalization, scaling, cleaning) that are involved before training a deep learning model. However, the text does describe the use of the Functional Data Analysis (FDA) method for analyzing a multifrequency acoustics dataset.

In FDA, the raw data is first expressed as functions using basis functions such as Fourier or Spline. This step can be considered as a form of data cleaning and transformation. The functional data is then modeled using aggregated data, where the layer descriptors are modeled by the environmental data, aggregated through the mean. The empirical functional mean and covariance function are then calculated.

It is important to note that these preprocessing steps are specific to the FDA method and may not directly apply to deep learning models. In general, for deep learning models, data preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are used to transform the data into a suitable format for the model. Normalization is the process of scaling numeric data to a common range, such as 0 to 1. Scaling is the process of adjusting the range of features to improve the performance of the model. Cleaning refers to the process of handling missing or incorrect data.

Therefore, while the provided context does not specifically mention the preprocessing steps of normalization, scaling, and cleaning for deep learning models, these steps are generally used in the preprocessing stage of deep learning model training.
