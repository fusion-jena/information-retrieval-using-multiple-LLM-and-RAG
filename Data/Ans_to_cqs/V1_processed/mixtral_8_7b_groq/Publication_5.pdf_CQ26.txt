Based on the provided context, there are no specific mentions of techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, there are some related concepts mentioned that are commonly used for addressing data bias and imbalance issues in machine learning and deep learning.

One such technique is stratified sampling, which is a method of splitting data into training and testing sets while preserving the original data's distribution of classes or labels. This can help ensure that each subset (training or testing) contains a representative sample of all classes, reducing the risk of bias in the model's performance.

Another technique is oversampling or undersampling, which involves adjusting the class distribution in the training data to address imbalances. Oversampling replicates instances of the minority class to balance the data, while undersampling reduces the number of instances of the majority class. These techniques can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class and improve its performance on the minority class.

Additionally, diverse data collection is a strategy for addressing data bias by gathering data from various sources, domains, or perspectives. This can help ensure that the data is representative of the population or problem being studied, reducing the risk of bias and improving the model's generalizability.

In the context of deep learning, data preprocessing techniques such as data augmentation can also help address data bias and imbalance issues. Data augmentation involves creating new instances of the data by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, or flipping. This can help increase the size and diversity of the training data, reducing overfitting and improving the model's performance on new data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, there are related concepts such as stratified sampling, oversampling/undersampling, diverse data collection, and data augmentation that can help address data bias and imbalance issues in deep learning.
