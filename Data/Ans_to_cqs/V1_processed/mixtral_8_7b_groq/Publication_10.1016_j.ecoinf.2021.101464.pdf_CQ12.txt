The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of any specific deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers. However, it does mention the use of "neural networks" and "deep-level data mining methods" in the context of analyzing the influence of forest microclimate on NAI (Net Assimilation Index).

Neural networks are a broad category of machine learning models that are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They can take various forms, including feedforward networks, recurrent networks, and convolutional networks, among others. The choice of a specific neural network model depends on the nature of the problem and the data at hand.

In the context of the study, the authors use a random forest model, which is a type of ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of the model. While random forests are not typically classified as deep learning models, they can be considered a type of shallow learning method that uses multiple layers of decision trees to learn complex patterns in the data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be said that the study uses neural networks and random forest models as part of its data mining pipeline, but it does not explicitly mention the use of any specific deep learning models such as CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers.
