The text provided discusses a study that uses machine learning methods to model net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. The raw data for this study was collected using two primary methods: soil sampling and topography analysis.

For soil sampling, the researchers collected 20-30 soil samples for each plot to obtain a composite sample. They obtained information for the depths of 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm. Soil pH in H2O, exchangeable cations (Ca2+), total acidity (H+), cation exchange capacity (CEC), base saturation (V), available phosphorus (P), P remaining in solution (P-res), and soil organic matter (SOM) were determined using standard methods. The soil analyses were performed at the laboratory of Soil Fertility at the Universidade Federal de Vi√ßosa (UFV), Brazil.

For topography analysis, the researchers calculated the elevation, slope, and aspect for each plot using the surface Spatial Analyst Tools in the ArcGIS 10.3.1 program. They used the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) for the analysis.

However, the text does not mention the use of surveys, sensors, or public datasets for collecting raw data. Therefore, it can be concluded that these methods were not utilized in this particular study.


 The raw data in the deep learning pipeline of this study was collected using soil sampling and topography analysis. Soil sampling involved collecting 20-30 soil samples for each plot to obtain a composite sample and determining various soil properties using standard methods. Topography analysis was carried out using the surface Spatial Analyst Tools in the ArcGIS 10.3.1 program and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) for the analysis. The text does not mention the use of surveys, sensors, or public datasets for collecting raw data.
