The provided context discusses several strategies used to train a deep learning model, but it does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the pipeline. However, there are several instances of randomness being employed throughout the described process.

First, the selection of 1,600 images for each zebra finch and 350 images for each of the other bird species is done randomly. This introduces variability in the training dataset, ensuring that the model does not overfit to a specific subset of images.

Second, when creating batches of images for training, only eight images are selected at a time randomly from the available dataset. This introduces another layer of randomness, ensuring that the model does not become too reliant on a specific order or sequence of images.

Third, when oversampling the dataset of the bird species with fewer images, 403 images are randomly duplicated to balance the training dataset. This strategy helps the model avoid over-generalization for the classes in majority due to its increased prior probability.

Fourth, when evaluating the model's accuracy, 250 random images from the pool of birds that were not included in the training dataset are used. This provides an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on new, unseen data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, there are several instances of randomness being employed throughout the described deep learning pipeline. These strategies include random selection of images for training, random selection of images for batches, random duplication of images for oversampling, and random selection of images for testing the model's accuracy.
