I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the comparison between learnable and traditional frontends for bird species recognition, discussing various techniques such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC), Constant-Q Transform (CQT), Per-Channel Energy Normalization (PCEN), and data augmentation. However, it does not mention the data repository or where to access the deep learning pipeline used in the experiment. I recommend checking the original research paper or corresponding resources for the required information.
