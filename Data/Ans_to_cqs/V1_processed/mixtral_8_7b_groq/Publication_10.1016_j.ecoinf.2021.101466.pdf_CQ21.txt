Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after training a model, such as the creation of saliency maps, calculation of metrics, or the construction of confusion matrices. However, the context does provide some insight into the data augmentation techniques that are typically performed as part of dataset preprocessing for training an image detection and classification model.

Data augmentation techniques like cropping, flipping, scaling, rotating, adding noise, and color transformation are used during dataset preprocessing to create effective variation in training data with the cost to collect actual photographs kept minimum. Furthermore, it is mentioned that applying random erasing to the training dataset of the EfficientNet resulted in moderate performance improvement.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention postprocessing steps, it does highlight the importance of data augmentation techniques during dataset preprocessing, which can impact the model's performance.
