Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020). The study mentions the use of a deep learning approach for species distribution modeling, but it does not specify where the data used in the study is available for access. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.

It is important to note that making data publicly available is a crucial aspect of scientific research, as it enables other researchers to replicate and build upon the findings. Therefore, it is hoped that the authors have made the data available in a reputable data repository, even if it is not mentioned in the study.
