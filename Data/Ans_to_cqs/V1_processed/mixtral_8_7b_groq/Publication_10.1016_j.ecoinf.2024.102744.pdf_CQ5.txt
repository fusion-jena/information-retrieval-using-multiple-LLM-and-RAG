The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the deep learning models were pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, and the VnPollenBee dataset was used for bee image classification.

The ImageNet dataset is a large-scale image recognition dataset that has been widely used for training and evaluating deep learning models. It contains over 14 million images belonging to 1000 categories.

On the other hand, the VnPollenBee dataset is a dataset specifically created for bee image classification. It contains images of bees, and the task is to classify them as pollen-bearing or non-pollen-bearing bees.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in the provided context involves pre-training the models on the ImageNet dataset and then fine-tuning them on the VnPollenBee dataset for bee image classification.
