Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. The context describes the metadata and data organization for a set of measurements related to environmental science, specifically related to electromagnetic field (E-Field) measurements.

The metadata includes details about the measurement installation, data file descriptions, and a hierarchy for measurement positions. However, there is no mention of any deep learning model or its hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are configuration variables that are set before the learning process begins, and they can have a significant impact on the performance of a deep learning model. Examples of hyperparameters include the learning rate, the type of optimizer, the number of hidden layers, and the number of units in each layer.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
