The deep learning pipeline described in the context uses spectral reflectance data in a CSV format as input. Spectral reflectance data is a type of measurement that quantifies the amount of light reflected by an object across different wavelengths (Chien, 1994). This data is typically organized in a table or matrix, where each row represents a different sample or pixel, and each column represents a different wavelength or spectral band.

In this particular pipeline, the spectral reflectance data has 4200 dimensions, which suggests that it covers a wide range of wavelengths or spectral bands. The data is fed into an input layer of a deep learning model, which consists of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with multiple hidden layers.

The first hidden layer contains 2048 neurons and uses the ReLu activation function to learn the nonlinear expression of the data. A batch normalization layer and a dropout layer follow this layer, with a random dropout probability of 25%. These layers help prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the model.

The second hidden layer contains 1024 neurons and also uses the ReLu activation function. Another batch normalization layer and a dropout layer follow this layer, again with a random dropout probability of 25%.

Finally, a one-dimensional output layer describes the Mn content, which is the variable of interest in this study.

To evaluate the performance of the model, several metrics are used, including the correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R2), and mean relative error (MAE). These metrics are commonly used in regression problems and help assess the accuracy and goodness of fit of the model.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline described in the context uses spectral reflectance data in a CSV format as input. The data is processed through an MLP model with multiple hidden layers, batch normalization, and dropout layers. The performance of the model is evaluated using several metrics, including correlation coefficient, root mean square error, and mean absolute error.
