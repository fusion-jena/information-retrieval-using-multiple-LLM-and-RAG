The provided context does not give specific details about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model is trained to optimize the distances between query points and prototypes in the embedding space. This implies that the model uses some form of distance-based loss function, which is a common choice in deep learning. The optimizer and learning rate would be chosen based on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem, and are likely specified in the original research paper or implementation of the model. Common choices for the optimizer include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop, while the learning rate can be set to a fixed value or adjusted dynamically using techniques such as learning rate schedules or learning rate decay.
