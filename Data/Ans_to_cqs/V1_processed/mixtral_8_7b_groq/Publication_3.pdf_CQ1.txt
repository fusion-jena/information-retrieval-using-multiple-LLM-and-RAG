The context provided does not give specific details about how the raw data was collected for the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the data used in the study is publicly available via Cornell Universityâ€™s Laboratory of Ornithology and Macaulay Library of Natural Sounds. This suggests that the data may have been collected through various means such as surveys, sensors, or other data collection methods and then made available in the library for researchers to use.

Additionally, the study by Aide et al. (2013) mentioned in the context, titled "Real-time bioacoustic monitoring and automated species identification" may provide some insight into the data collection methods used in this study. The study focuses on using bioacoustic monitoring, which involves the use of sensors and microphones to record and analyze animal sounds, for automated species identification. Therefore, it is possible that a similar data collection method was used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context.

It is also worth noting that the study aims to develop the methods for application to additional taxonomic groups such as insects and birds, which suggests that the data collection methods used may be applicable to a wide range of species and may involve the use of sensors or other methods for collecting animal sounds.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific details about the data collection methods used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that the data may have been collected through means such as surveys, sensors, or other data collection methods and made publicly available in a library. Additionally, the study by Aide et al. (2013) suggests that bioacoustic monitoring, which involves the use of sensors and microphones to record and analyze animal sounds, may have been used for data collection.
