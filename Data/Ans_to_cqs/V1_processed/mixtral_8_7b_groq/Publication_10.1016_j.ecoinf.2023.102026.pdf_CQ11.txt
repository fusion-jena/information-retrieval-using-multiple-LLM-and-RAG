Based on the provided context, there is no information available about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link related to it. The context contains information about an article titled "Not seeing the forest for the trees: Generalised linear model out-performs random forest in species distribution modelling for Southeast Asian felids" by L. Chiaverini et al., published in the Ecological Informatics journal in 2023. The article discusses the use of generalised linear models and random forests in species distribution modeling for Southeast Asian felids at different spatial scales.

The context also mentions keywords such as Bootstrapping, Machine learning, Multi-scale, Species distribution modelling, but there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
