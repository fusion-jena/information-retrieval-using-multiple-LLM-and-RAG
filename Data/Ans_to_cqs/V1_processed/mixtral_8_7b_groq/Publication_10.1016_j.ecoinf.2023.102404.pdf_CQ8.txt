Based on the provided context, there is no information about a specific code repository for a deep learning pipeline related to geo-big data applications, forest above-ground biomass estimation, or canopy height mapping.

The authors have published several papers using various remote sensing data and machine/deep learning techniques for different applications. However, they have not mentioned or provided a link to any code repository in their papers.

It is possible that the authors have not made the code publicly available or have not published it in a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository. In some cases, researchers may not share their code due to various reasons such as intellectual property, ongoing research, or lack of time.

Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific code repository for the deep learning pipeline related to the context provided.
