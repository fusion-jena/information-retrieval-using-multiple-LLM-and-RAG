Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, there are some details about the methodology and validation process that can give us some insights.

The context mentions that there was a validation process, which involved the calculation of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of residuals with a kriging variance of 1.04. Kriging is a geostatistical method used to interpolate spatial data, and the RMSE is a measure of the difference between values predicted by a model and the actual values. This information suggests that the model's predictions were compared to actual data and evaluated using a quantitative measure, which is a good practice for assessing the accuracy and generalizability of a model.

Additionally, the context mentions that there were multiple authors involved in the study, with responsibilities including methodology, investigation, formal analysis, and data curation. It is likely that these authors followed established practices for developing and validating a deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, and stratified splitting. However, without explicit information about these measures, we cannot confirm that they were used.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, it does mention the use of validation and quantitative evaluation, as well as the involvement of multiple authors with relevant responsibilities. These factors suggest that established practices for developing and validating a deep learning model were likely followed, but without further information, we cannot confirm the specific measures taken.
