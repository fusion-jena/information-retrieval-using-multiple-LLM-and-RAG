The performance of the deep learning model in the study was evaluated using four metrics: precision, mean average precision (mAP@0.5), recall, and mean percent error of misdetection.

Precision is the percentage of correct positive predictions made by the model. It is a measure of the model's exactness, indicating the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made.

Mean average precision (mAP@0.5) is a measure of the accuracy of object detection models. It uses an Intersection-over-union measure set to 0.5 to determine the accuracy of the model in detecting objects. It is a more robust measure than precision as it takes into account the localization of the detected objects.

Recall is a measure of the model's completeness, indicating the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances. It shows how successfully a model can make correct detection predictions out of all the predictions it should make.

Mean percent error of misdetection is a measure of the model's ability to correctly identify the absence of an object. It is the average of the absolute differences between the predicted probability of an object's absence and the actual probability of its absence.

These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, taking into account its ability to make correct positive and negative predictions, as well as its ability to accurately localize detected objects.
