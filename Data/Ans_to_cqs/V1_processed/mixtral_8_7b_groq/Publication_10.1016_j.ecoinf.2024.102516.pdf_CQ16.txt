The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context provided is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the training process is manually determined since a validation loss plateau or any other common convergence criteria are not mentioned.

In the described method, the network is trained with the mean scaled absolute error as regression loss, using a batch size of 1, an input image resolution of 512 x 512 pixels, and a learning rate of 1e-1. Only horizontal flipping is used for data augmentation during this phase. The network's performance is then evaluated on the validation set, but the termination criteria are not specified.

In contrast, the baseline comparison using a ResNet50 model pre-trained on the ImageNet classification dataset with added FPN (later referred to as the ImageNet baseline model) is evaluated after training on the dedicated plant cover data. Again, the stopping criteria for this model are not mentioned.

Based on the provided context, it can be concluded that the training termination criteria are not explicitly stated. It can be inferred that the training process is manually determined, and the model's performance is evaluated based on the validation set's error. In practice, early stopping or monitoring validation loss plateau are common techniques to determine when training should be stopped. However, these techniques are not mentioned in the context provided.
