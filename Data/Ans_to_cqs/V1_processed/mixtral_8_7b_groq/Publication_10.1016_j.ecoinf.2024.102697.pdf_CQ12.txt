Based on the information provided, there is no indication that a deep learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer, is used in the described study. The study primarily focuses on the use of random forest models, a type of machine learning technique, for predicting water quality indicators and soil heat flux. Deep learning models are a subset of machine learning techniques that are typically used for tasks involving large amounts of data and complex patterns, but in this case, the study does not mention the use of any deep learning models.
