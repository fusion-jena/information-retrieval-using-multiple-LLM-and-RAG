In the context provided, there is a mention of Local Response Normalization (LRN) and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function processing, which are regularization techniques used in the DCNN model of the study. However, there is no explicit mention of dropout or L2 regularization.

LRN is a type of regularization technique that helps to reduce overfitting by normalizing the responses of neurons in a layer, which helps to prevent any single neuron from dominating the layer's output. This is done by applying a normalization operation to a small neighborhood of neuron outputs, which helps to ensure that the activations of neurons in a layer are more balanced.

ReLU is another regularization technique that helps to reduce overfitting by introducing non-linearity in the model. ReLU maps any input value to zero if it is less than zero and leaves it unchanged if it is greater than or equal to zero. This introduces sparsity in the model, which helps to reduce overfitting.

Dropout and L2 regularization are other commonly used regularization techniques in deep learning. Dropout is a technique that randomly drops out a fraction of the neurons in a layer during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by ensuring that the model does not rely too heavily on any single neuron. L2 regularization, on the other hand, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This helps to reduce overfitting by encouraging the model to use smaller weights, which helps to prevent any single weight from dominating the model's output.

In summary, while the context provided mentions LRN and ReLU as regularization techniques used in the DCNN model of the study, it does not explicitly mention dropout or L2 regularization. However, these are commonly used regularization techniques in deep learning that can help to prevent overfitting.
