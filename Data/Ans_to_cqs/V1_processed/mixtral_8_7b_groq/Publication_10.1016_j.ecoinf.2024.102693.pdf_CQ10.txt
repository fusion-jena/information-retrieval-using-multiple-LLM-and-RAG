I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses two types of models in deep learning, CNN-like and Transformer-like, along with a brief history and development of each. However, it does not mention or provide any links to the code repository for these models or the deep learning pipeline.
