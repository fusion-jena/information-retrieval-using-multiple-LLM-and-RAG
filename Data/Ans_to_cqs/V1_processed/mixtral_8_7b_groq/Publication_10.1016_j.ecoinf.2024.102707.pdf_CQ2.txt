The provided context discusses the use of imagery in a deep learning pipeline, specifically with the YOLOv6 object detection model. There is no explicit mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV. However, it can be inferred that the training data used in this study consists of images, as the authors tested different spatial resolutions of the imagery during the training process. They also mentioned publishing the data used in the study, which would likely include the images used for training and testing the model.

In addition, the authors cited several studies that used image data in their deep learning pipelines. For example, Witharana and Lynch (2016) used very high spatial resolution satellite images to detect penguin guano. Wood et al. (2021) used drone imagery to assess the accuracy and precision of citizen scientist animal counts. Weimerskirch et al. (2018) used drone flights to study the behavioral and physiological responses of sub-Antarctic seabirds. These studies further support the inference that image data is used in the deep learning pipeline discussed in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that image data is used in the deep learning pipeline. However, there is no mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV.
