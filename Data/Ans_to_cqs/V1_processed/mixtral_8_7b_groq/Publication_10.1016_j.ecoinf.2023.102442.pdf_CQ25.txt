The purpose of the deep learning model in the context provided is for detecting artisanal small-scale mining (ASSM) activities. This model is a multispectral convolutional neural network designed to analyze Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and identify ASSM sites in Ghana. The primary goal is to apply deep learning techniques to shallow mining, thereby improving the accuracy of ASSM detection.

The model's design includes a preprocessing stage where images are atmospherically corrected and a post-classification stage where misclassified pixels are reclassified to enhance the model's performance. Specifically, the model undergoes urban reclassification to improve urban accuracy by 14 percentage points, which is crucial for accurately distinguishing urban areas from ASSM sites.

The deep learning model's flexibility allows it to be used for large-scale analysis, which is essential given the rapid growth of mining activities. By combining cloud processing with automated reclassification, the model can efficiently and accurately classify mining sites, even in regions with extensive mining growth.

In summary, the deep learning model's purpose is to detect ASSM sites in satellite imagery accurately and efficiently, enabling large-scale analysis and monitoring of mining activities. This is achieved through a multispectral convolutional neural network designed for Sentinel-2 imagery, with preprocessing, post-classification, and urban reclassification stages that enhance the model's accuracy and applicability for large-scale ASSM detection.
