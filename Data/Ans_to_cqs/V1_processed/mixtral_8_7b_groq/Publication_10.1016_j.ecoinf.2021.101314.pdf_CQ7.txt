The provided context does not give information about the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does describe the process of redescription mining, which is a method that combines partitioning techniques, such as clustering, and modeling techniques, such as regression, to identify multiple local models on subsets of data and automatically generate sets of limiting conditions and the corresponding split of the data. This method is used to generate interpretable, not overly complex queries that can be applied to dental and climate variables.

In the example provided, a query over climatic variables is used to select localities where the maximum temperature of the warmest month and the precipitation of the warmest quarter are greater than specific values. The support of this query is the set of localities where the specified temperature and precipitation conditions are satisfied.

It is possible that the data splitting for deep learning model training in this context is based on the local models and limiting conditions generated through redescription mining. However, the specific criteria used for splitting the data are not provided in the given context.
