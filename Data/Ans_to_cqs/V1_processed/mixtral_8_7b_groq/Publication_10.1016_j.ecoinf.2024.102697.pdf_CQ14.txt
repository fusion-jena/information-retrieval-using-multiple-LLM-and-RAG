The hyperparameters of the random forest model were optimized using Bayesian Optimization to minimize a 5 k-fold cross-validation loss during model development. This information is provided in the first piece of context. However, the specific details about the grid search or random search being used for optimization are not mentioned. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to definitively say whether grid search, random search, or Bayesian Optimization was used for hyperparameter optimization. It is only known that Bayesian Optimization was used for minimizing cross-validation loss during model development.
