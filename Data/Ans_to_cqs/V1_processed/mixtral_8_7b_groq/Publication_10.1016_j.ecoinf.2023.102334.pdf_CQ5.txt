The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for facial recognition of sika deer are not mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the study involves the use of computer vision techniques and Transformer in the field of facial recognition. Commonly used datasets in the field of computer vision include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet.

The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. It contains 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 0 to 9.

The CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets are labeled subsets of the 80 million tiny images dataset, and are used for object recognition research. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The CIFAR-100 dataset is just like CIFAR-10, except it has 100 classes containing 600 images each. There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class.

The ImageNet dataset is a large-scale dataset of images that is widely used for object recognition and other tasks in computer vision. It contains more than 14 million images, each associated with one of 21,841 categories. The images in ImageNet are typically color images of everyday objects, and the dataset is used for both training and evaluating computer vision models.

In summary, while the specific datasets used in the study are not mentioned, commonly used datasets in the field of computer vision include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet.
