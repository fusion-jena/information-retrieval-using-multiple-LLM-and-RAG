The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link related to it. The computing tools section mentions the use of the DAFNE HPC scientific computing center for calculations, with two Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) ProLiant DL560 Gen10 nodes and a parallel configuration managed by the Python 3.6.8 package Ray. The preliminary analysis section describes an MCMC algorithm with a perturbed numerical solution and given parameters for the Drosophila suzukii case study. However, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
