The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved several steps, including model serialization and platform selection. First, the model was partially trained on a large dataset of bacterial community images to learn the data. Then, the partially trained model was used to annotate new images, creating a self-annotation dataset that was manually checked and edited by a human. This allowed for the preparation of a large dataset within a day. A smaller dataset was also created for fine-tuning the model on images taken from a portable microscope in Kenya, where the image quality was lower.

To augment the dataset and improve training performance, various image transformations were applied, including flips, rotations, and affine transformations. The dataset was then trained with a ResNet-101 network for 500 epochs using heavier augmentation.

Once the model was trained, it was deployed on a suitable platform for use in bacterial community characterization. However, the context does not provide specific details about the platform selection or model serialization process.

In summary, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved preparing a large dataset through partial training and self-annotation, augmenting the dataset with image transformations, training the model on the augmented dataset with a ResNet-101 network, and deploying the model on a suitable platform.
