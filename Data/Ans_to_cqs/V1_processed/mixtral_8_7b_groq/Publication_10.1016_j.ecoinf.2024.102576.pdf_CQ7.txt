The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, as described in the given context, involves dividing the total number of grid cells into three sets: training, validation, and test data. However, the exact proportions of each set are not specified.

First, 16,660 grid cells with a resolution of 2560 m were created in South Korea for generating training data for the PCF. Half of the total cells (8,330) were randomly extracted as a mask for training data, and 20% of the total cells (3,332) were randomly extracted as a mask for validation data. The PSI was extracted from both the training and validation data sets to prepare input data for model training.

The remaining data, not explicitly mentioned in the context, can be used as test data. Test data is typically used to evaluate the performance of the trained model on unseen data. It is important to have a separate test data set to ensure that the model's performance is not overestimated due to overfitting on the training data.

In summary, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in the given context involves randomly extracting half of the total cells for training data and 20% for validation data. The remaining cells can be used as test data to evaluate the model's performance. However, the exact proportions of each data set can vary depending on the specific requirements of the deep learning model and the available data.
