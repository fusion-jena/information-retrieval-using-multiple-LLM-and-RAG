Based on the information provided, the specific deep learning model in question is an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network. However, the context does not explicitly mention which framework was used to build this model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.

The text does mention several technical aspects of the LSTM model, such as the use of the Adam optimization algorithm, the addition of a dropout layer for regularization, and the pre-processing of the training set using a MinMaxScaler. These details suggest that the model was likely implemented using a high-level framework that supports these features.

Two of the most popular frameworks for building deep learning models are TensorFlow and PyTorch. Both of these frameworks support the creation of LSTM networks, as well as the optimization algorithms and pre-processing techniques mentioned in the context.

In conclusion, while the context does not provide enough information to determine which framework was used to build the LSTM model, it is likely that either TensorFlow or PyTorch was used, given their widespread popularity and support for LSTM networks.
