The context provided does not give information about the specific deep learning framework used to build the model. It mentions the use of a pre-trained ResNet-50 CNN model for feature extraction, but it does not specify whether this model was implemented in TensorFlow, PyTorch, or another framework. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
