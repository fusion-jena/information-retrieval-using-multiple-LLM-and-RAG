Based on the provided context, there is no explicit description of a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, we can infer that the performance of the model was assessed using the Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metric and True Skill Statistics (TSS) after the training phase. This was done to validate the model predictions and compare the suitable areas from the current prediction to future predictions.

Additionally, the threshold value of 0.6 was derived from equal training sensitivity and specificity, which suggests that the model performance was evaluated during the training phase to some extent. It is possible that the model performance was monitored using cross-validation or other techniques, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.

Therefore, while the context does not provide a clear answer to the query, we can infer that the model performance was assessed after training using AUC and TSS, and possibly monitored during training using cross-validation or other techniques. However, further information is needed to confirm this.
