The deep learning (DL) model in the context of aerial surveys of African wildlife is used for the detection of animals. This is evident from the description of the model's application in processing aerial images of African savanna, where the model is trained to identify and count specific wildlife species. However, the specific type or task of deep learning model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

The DL model is used in conjunction with human manual interpretation steps in a 'human-assisted' DL-based image processing pipeline, referred to as the Semi-Automated Deep Learning (SADL) model. This model is designed to minimize human effort while maintaining the quality of counting results. The integration of the SADL model with the OCC technique (SADL-OCC) is presented in the section, which discusses the main components and steps of this developed approach.

In summary, while the specific type of deep learning model is not specified, it is clear that the DL model is used for the detection of animals in aerial surveys of African wildlife.
