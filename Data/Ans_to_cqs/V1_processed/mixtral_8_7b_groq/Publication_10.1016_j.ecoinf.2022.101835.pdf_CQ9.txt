The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the comparison of machine learning algorithms, specifically Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), for predicting the first flowering date and full blossom date. It mentions the use of certain libraries, tools, and parameters for optimization but does not provide any details about the data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
