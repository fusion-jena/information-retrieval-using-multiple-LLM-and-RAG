The provided context does not include specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for the studies mentioned. However, it is common practice in deep learning to use data augmentation techniques to increase the amount of training data, prevent overfitting, and improve model generalization.

Some common data augmentation techniques for image data include:

1. Flipping: Horizontal or vertical flipping of the images. This technique helps the model to learn symmetrical patterns in the data.
2. Rotation: Rotating the images by a certain angle. This helps the model to learn rotation invariant features.
3. Scaling: Changing the scale of the images, either by zooming in (enlarging) or zooming out (shrinking). This technique helps the model to learn features at different scales.
4. Translation: Shifting the images horizontally or vertically. This helps the model to learn features that may be located at different positions in the image.
5. Color jittering: Randomly changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue of the images. This technique helps the model to learn color invariant features.
6. MixUp: Combining two or more images to create a new image. This technique helps the model to learn interpolations between classes.

These techniques can be applied on-the-fly during training, or they can be applied to the original dataset before training, storing the augmented versions as new samples. The choice of data augmentation techniques depends on the specific problem and dataset at hand. It is essential to experiment with different data augmentation strategies to find the best combination for each problem.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines, common data augmentation techniques for image data include flipping, rotation, scaling, translation, color jittering, and MixUp. These techniques help improve model generalization, prevent overfitting, and increase the amount of training data.
