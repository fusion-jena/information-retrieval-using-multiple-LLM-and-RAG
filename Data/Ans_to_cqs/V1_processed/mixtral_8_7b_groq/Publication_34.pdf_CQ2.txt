The deep learning pipeline can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and CSV files, among others. However, the provided context specifically discusses the use of CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) in the context of environmental input data.

In this particular scenario, the data format is expected to be multi-dimensional arrays, such as 2D or 3D arrays, where elements are spatially auto-correlated. For instance, an input RGB image would be represented as a 3D array with dimensions 256x3xHxW, where H and W represent the height and width of the image, and 3 corresponds to the Red, Green, and Blue color channels.

The context also introduces specific notations for handling different types of input data. When a distinction is made, x represents a vector, while an array is always noted as X. Spatial site index is denoted as a superscript on the input variable (X^k or x^k for the kth site), and the component index is represented as a subscript (x^k_p or X^k_{.,j,.} for the jth matrix slice taken on the second dimension). When an input is associated with a precise point location in a continuous spatial domain, the point z is noted as an argument: x(z).

In summary, while the deep learning pipeline can accommodate various data formats, the provided context focuses on the use of CNNs with multi-dimensional arrays, particularly 2D or 3D arrays, in the context of environmental input data.
