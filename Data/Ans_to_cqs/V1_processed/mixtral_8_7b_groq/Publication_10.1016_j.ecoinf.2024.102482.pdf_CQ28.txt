The provided context does not explicitly mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It focuses more on the description of the proposed water quality monitoring system based on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and its performance in detecting water pollution using the swimming behavior of C. elegans. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
