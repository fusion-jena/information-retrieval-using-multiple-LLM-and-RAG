The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that Tensorflow, a system for large-scale machine learning, is used (Abadi et al., 2016). Tensorflow supports the use of GPUs and TPUs (Google's Tensor Processing Units) to accelerate the training of deep learning models. Therefore, it can be inferred that either GPUs or TPUs, or both, could have been used for training the deep learning model in the given context.
