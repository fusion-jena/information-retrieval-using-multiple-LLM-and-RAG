The deep learning model in the given context is used for object detection, specifically for detecting moths in depth images. The researchers argue that the weights optimized for color images can also be valuable for detecting features in depth images. This is because depth images, like color images, also contain object boundaries.

To implement this, the researchers trained a standard deep learning classifier, ResNet-50 pre-trained on ImageNet, on the cropped bounding box images of the detected moths. They achieved an average accuracy of 89.00% on a held-out test set. Additionally, they augmented the training dataset with images obtained from internet image search engines. However, since these images can contain noisy annotations, they proposed filtering different types of label noise to further improve the recognition performance of the system. This is especially important when the initial training set is small, with less than ten sample images per species.

Therefore, the deep learning model is specifically used for detecting moths in depth images, and the researchers have implemented a standard deep learning classifier to achieve this. They have also taken measures to improve the recognition performance of the system, such as augmenting the training dataset and filtering label noise.
