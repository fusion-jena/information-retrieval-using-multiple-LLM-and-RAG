The context does not provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that a deep learning algorithm, specifically the multilayer perceptron (MLP), was used for soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) modeling. MLP is a type of feedforward artificial neural network that consists of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node in the hidden and output layers connects adjacent layers via an activation function.

The training of deep learning models like MLP often requires significant computational power, and it is common to use specialized hardware such as graphics processing units (GPUs) or tensor processing units (TPUs) to accelerate the training process. However, the context does not mention any details about the hardware resources used for training the MLP model for SOCS modeling. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query based on the provided context.
