Based on the information provided, it is not explicitly stated what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications in the text that suggest some steps were taken towards this goal.

Firstly, the study used a diverse dataset for training and testing the model. The dataset includes different types of wetland and non-wetland classes, such as bog, fen, marsh, swamp, shallow water, urban, deep water, and upland. This diversity in the dataset can help the model to learn a wide range of features and patterns, which can improve its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Secondly, the study evaluated the impact of the data split on the final accuracy of wetland mapping. By using different ratios of training and testing data, the researchers were able to assess how well the model performs when trained on varying amounts of data. This can help to ensure that the model can generalize to different data distributions and sizes.

However, the text does not mention the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are common techniques used to improve the generalizability of deep learning models. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on one fold, and testing it on the remaining folds. This process is repeated for each fold, and the results are averaged to obtain a more robust estimate of the model's performance. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets while preserving the class distribution, which can help to ensure that the model is not biased towards any particular class.

In summary, while the study used a diverse dataset and evaluated the impact of data split, it is not explicitly stated whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
