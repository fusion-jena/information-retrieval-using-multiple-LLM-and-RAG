Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, I can provide some suggestions on how generalizability could have been addressed based on common practices in machine learning.

1. Diverse dataset: A diverse dataset can help ensure that the deep learning model can generalize well to different types of data. From the context, it appears that the study used data related to land use/cover, GSN (Grassland Structure Niche) changes, and climate change. A diverse dataset in this context could include data from various geographical locations, different land use/cover types, and varying degrees of climate change impacts.

2. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a common technique used to assess the performance and generalizability of machine learning models. It involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on one fold, and testing it on another fold. This process is repeated for all folds, providing an estimate of the model's performance on unseen data. Although not explicitly mentioned in the context, cross-validation could have been used to evaluate the deep learning model's generalizability.

3. Stratified splitting: Stratified splitting is a method used to ensure that the training and testing sets have a similar distribution of classes or labels. In the context of the study, if the data was imbalanced (e.g., more samples from one land use/cover type than another), stratified splitting could have been used to create training and testing sets with a balanced representation of the different land use/cover types or GSN changes.

Without more specific information about the deep learning model and the methods used in the study, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer. However, based on common practices in machine learning, the measures listed above could have been taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
