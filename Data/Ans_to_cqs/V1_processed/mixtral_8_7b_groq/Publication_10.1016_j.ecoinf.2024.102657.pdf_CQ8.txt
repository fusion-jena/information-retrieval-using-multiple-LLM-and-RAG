The provided context does not give information about the specific location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The article "DialectDecoder: Human/machine teaming for bird song classification and anomaly detection" mentions the use of a deep learning pipeline for bird song classification, but it does not mention where the code for this pipeline is located. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query. It is possible that the code repository is available on a platform such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but this information is not provided in the given context. If you are interested in accessing the code, you may want to try contacting the authors of the article for more information.
