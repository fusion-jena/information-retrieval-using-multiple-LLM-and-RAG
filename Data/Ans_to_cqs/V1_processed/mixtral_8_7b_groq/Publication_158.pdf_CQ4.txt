The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include rotation, reflection bias, and random noise. Specifically, images were rotated during training, and a reflectance bias of ±10% was applied. Additionally, random noise of ±10% reflectance was added to 15% of the input image. However, there is no mention of flipping or scaling techniques being used in the data augmentation process. These techniques were used to enhance the sample variation and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. The data augmentation was applied to account for the range of image object sizes, from a single pixel to larger assemblages extending beyond the 32 by 32 pixel input image. The best network weights were kept based on the validation data across training epochs, and early stopping criteria were applied if no improvement was found in 50 epochs. This process was repeated for an ensemble of three models, with varying input image sizes, to improve the deep learning classifier's performance.
