The context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the BirdNET deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the pipeline is used for classifying 984 bird species, which suggests that the dataset is likely a collection of bird sounds or spectrograms. The training process follows best practices in deep learning, which includes data augmentation techniques, but the specific dataset used for training is not provided. Therefore, I cannot give a specific answer to this query without additional information.
