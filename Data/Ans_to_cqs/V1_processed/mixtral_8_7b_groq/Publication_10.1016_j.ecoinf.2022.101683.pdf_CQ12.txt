Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating that a deep learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer, was used in the pipeline. The text focuses on the evaluation of models for a binary classification task, providing metrics like AUC, Omission, TPR, k, and TSS. However, it does not mention any specific type of deep learning model used. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.
