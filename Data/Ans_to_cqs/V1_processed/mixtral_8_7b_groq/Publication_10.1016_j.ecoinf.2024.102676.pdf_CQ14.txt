Based on the provided context, there is no information given about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text does not mention any methods such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization techniques. The experiments were conducted with the default FIT parameters for each species, and no hyperparameter tuning was performed. This was done to ensure uniformity and comparability between the methods. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
