Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model in estimating Water Quality Parameters (WQP) is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the deep learning models were considered but not implemented due to the limited number of samples.

Deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), can be used for various tasks, including classification, segmentation, and detection. In the context of WQP estimation, deep learning models could potentially be used for classification tasks, such as distinguishing between different levels of water quality or identifying the presence of specific pollutants.

However, the application of deep learning models in WQP estimation is limited by the availability of data. As mentioned in the context, the research of Feng et al. suggests that a limited number of samples is not conducive to deep learning. Therefore, it can be inferred that the purpose of the deep learning model in this context was not pursued due to the lack of sufficient data.

Instead, machine learning models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were used to estimate WQP. These models have been shown to be effective in handling non-linear relationships and have been applied in various fields.

Moreover, the development of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods like Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) has been considered to explain black-box models like the machine learning models used in this study. These methods can provide insights into the relationships between input features and output results, which can be useful for understanding and interpreting the prediction outcomes.

In summary, while the specific purpose of the deep learning model in WQP estimation is not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that deep learning models could potentially be used for classification tasks. However, the application of deep learning models is limited by the availability of data, and machine learning models were used instead. Additionally, the development of XAI methods has been considered to explain the relationships between input features and output results for the machine learning models used in this study.
