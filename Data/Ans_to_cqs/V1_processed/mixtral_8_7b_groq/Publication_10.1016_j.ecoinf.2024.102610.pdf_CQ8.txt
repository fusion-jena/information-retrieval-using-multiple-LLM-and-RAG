The provided pieces of context do not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The sources given focus on different aspects such as the application of machine learning and deep learning techniques in predicting infectious diseases, a classification and regression training package, and a crowdsourcing-based nationwide tick collection study. While they discuss various methods and applications, they do not mention where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide the specific location of the code repository.
