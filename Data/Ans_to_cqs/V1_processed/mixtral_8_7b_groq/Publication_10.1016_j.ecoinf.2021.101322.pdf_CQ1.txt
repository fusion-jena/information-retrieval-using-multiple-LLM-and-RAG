The provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for the project. However, it does mention the use of a salmon scale image dataset (doi:10.21335/NMDC-1050865887) and an expert reading of an additional 150 image dataset (doi:10.21335/NMDC-1462728994). This suggests that the raw data was collected through imaging of salmon scales, either from surveys, sensors, or other sources.

Additionally, the project utilized a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) based architecture, specifically EfficientNet (<https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet>), and pre-trained network weights (EfficientNet-B4) from that architecture (<https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet/blob/master/efficientnet/weights.py>). These architectures are typically pre-trained on large-scale image datasets such as ImageNet, and then fine-tuned on the specific task at hand.

Therefore, while the context does not provide explicit details on the data collection methods, it can be inferred that the raw data was collected through imaging of salmon scales, and potentially from multiple sources such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets.
