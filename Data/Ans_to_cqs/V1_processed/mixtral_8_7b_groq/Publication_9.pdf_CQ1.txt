The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for ecology and evolutionary biology. However, it does mention the use of image datasets in this context. These image datasets could potentially be obtained through various means such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets.

For instance, surveys could be conducted to collect images of specific organisms or environments. Sensors like cameras could be used to automatically capture images at regular intervals or in response to specific triggers. Public datasets, such as ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009), could also be utilized as a source of images for deep learning applications in ecology and evolutionary biology.

Moreover, the context highlights the use of computer vision techniques and deep learning algorithms, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for accurate and scalable image pre-processing and automated identification and classification of complex patterns in noisy environments. These techniques typically require large annotated image datasets for training and evaluation. Therefore, the availability of suitable image datasets is an important consideration for deep learning applications in this field.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for ecology and evolutionary biology, it is likely that image datasets are obtained through various means such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets.
