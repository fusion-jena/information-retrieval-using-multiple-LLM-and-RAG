The text provided does not give explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. It does mention that the dataset was recorded at a different location and gradually expanded, which could potentially contribute to the model's ability to generalize. However, this is not a direct measure taken to ensure generalizability.

The text also discusses the use of a β term in the VAE model, which favors a well generalized latent space over good reconstructions. This implies that some consideration was given to the model's ability to generalize, but it does not specify how this was implemented or what specific values of β were used.

The optimization objective of a VAE consists of two competing terms, a reconstruction loss and a regularization term, which could potentially help with generalization. However, the text does not provide details about how these terms were weighted or what specific techniques were used to balance them.

In summary, while the text suggests that some thought was given to the generalizability of the deep learning model, it does not provide specific information about the measures that were taken to ensure it. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
