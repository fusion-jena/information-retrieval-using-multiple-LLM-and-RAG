The provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of deep learning (DL) and privacy-preserving deep learning (PPDL) techniques for analyzing satellite images while maintaining anonymity and data security. However, it does not specify where the data repository for this pipeline can be found.

The context includes details about the CNN architecture used in the study, which consists of various layers such as convolutional layers, activation functions, max pooling, dropout, flattening, and fully connected layers. It also mentions the ResNet and Xception models, which are CNN-based architectures used for image classification tasks.

However, the context does not provide any information about the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
