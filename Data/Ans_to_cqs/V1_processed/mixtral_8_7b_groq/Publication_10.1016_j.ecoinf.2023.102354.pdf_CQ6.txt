Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved, including normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

Normalization is the process of rescaling numeric columns to a range of [0,1] or mean = 0 and variance = 1. This step is crucial because deep learning models are sensitive to the scale of the input features. Different features might have different scales, and normalization ensures that all features contribute equally to the learning process. There are various normalization techniques, such as Min-Max scaling and Z-score scaling. Min-Max scaling rescales the values to a range of [0,1] by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the range. Z-score scaling standardizes the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation.

Scaling is another preprocessing step that involves resizing the input data to have the same scale. This step is necessary because deep learning models perform better when the input data has a consistent scale. For example, images are usually scaled to 256x256 or 224x224 pixels before training a deep learning model.

Cleaning is the process of removing noise, outliers, and missing values from the input data. Noise can be introduced during data collection, and it can negatively affect the learning process. Outliers are extreme values that can skew the distribution of the data and affect the model's performance. Missing values can occur due to various reasons, such as human error or equipment failure. Cleaning the input data is essential because deep learning models are sensitive to noise, outliers, and missing values. There are various techniques for cleaning the input data, such as imputation, interpolation, and outlier detection.

In summary, preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are crucial before training a deep learning model. These steps ensure that the input data is in the right format, consistent scale, and free from noise, outliers, and missing values. Proper preprocessing can significantly improve the model's performance and accuracy.
