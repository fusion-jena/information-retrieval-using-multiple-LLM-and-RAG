The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a type of feedforward artificial neural network. The MLP model consists of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. In this specific pipeline, the input layer has 4200 dimensions corresponding to the spectral reflectance data. The first hidden layer contains 2048 neurons with the ReLu activation function, followed by a batch normalization layer and a dropout layer. The second hidden layer has 1024 neurons, also using the ReLu activation function, followed by another batch normalization layer and a dropout layer. Finally, there is a one-dimensional output layer that describes the Mn content. The model's hyperparameters, including the number of layers, number of neurons per layer, dropout probability, learning rate, and batch size, were optimized to achieve the best performance.
