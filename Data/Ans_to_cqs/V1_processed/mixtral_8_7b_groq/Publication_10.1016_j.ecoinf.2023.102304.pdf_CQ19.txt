The provided context does not contain information about the deep learning models, frameworks, or tools used in the study. The text mainly focuses on the optimization of Land Trend Ridge (LTR) and other spectral indices for wildfire recovery analysis in different types of forests and landscapes.

The authors discuss various spectral bands, vegetation indices, and methods for analyzing wildfire recovery patterns. They mention techniques such as BFAST, NBR, NDVI, EVI, CCDC, VCT, FZ, NDMI, and NDFI, but there is no information about deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or others.

In summary, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
