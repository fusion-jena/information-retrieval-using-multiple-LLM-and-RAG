The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that three different datasets were used for training and testing the deep learning models in the coral reef classification task. These datasets are referred to as the "first dataset," "second dataset," and "third dataset" in the tables provided.

The first dataset was used to compare the performance of hand-crafted descriptors and D-CNN models. The second dataset was used to compare the performance of different classifiers for all datasets. The third dataset, also known as the Bleached, Healthy, and Dead (BHD) dataset, was used to evaluate the performance of hand-crafted descriptors and D-CNN models for classifying coral reefs into three categories: bleached, healthy, and dead.

It can be noted that the specific details of these datasets, such as the number of images, resolution, and diversity, are not provided in the given context. Therefore, it is not possible to compare these datasets with well-known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

In summary, while the specific names and details of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not provided, it can be inferred that three different datasets were used for the coral reef classification task. These datasets are referred to as the first, second, and third datasets in the given tables.
