The text provided does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the models. However, it does mention that a five-fold cross-validation is used in conjunction with GridSearchCV to fine-tune the hyperparameters of each model. This process aims to enhance the predictive performance of the models. The negative mean square error is set as the target measure during this hyperparameter optimization process.

Moreover, the text states that the best regression parameter has been used for training each model after regression hyperparameter tuning. It can be inferred that the training process might be complete when the model's performance, in terms of the negative mean square error or other evaluation metrics, reaches a satisfactory level or stops improving significantly.

In general, training of machine learning models can be considered complete when validation loss plateaus or shows minimal improvement, or when the model's performance on a separate test set meets the desired criteria. The specific stopping criterion can vary depending on the model, the data, and the problem at hand.
