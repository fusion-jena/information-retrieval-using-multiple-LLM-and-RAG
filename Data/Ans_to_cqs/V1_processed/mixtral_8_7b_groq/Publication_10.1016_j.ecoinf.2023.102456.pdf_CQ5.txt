The provided pieces of context do not directly mention the use of standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do describe the use of custom datasets in the research.

The research focuses on a survey of missing data in machine learning and proposes a new data-driven architecture to learn neighborhood relationships in a system. The dataset used in this research includes data on forest fires and their impact on the environment. Specifically, the dataset includes information on the states of each cell in a forest fire scenario, which is used as a spatial input of dimensions 257 × 257 × 9, denoted as M (masks of states).

The dataset used in the research is not explicitly described in terms of its size, sources, or preprocessing steps. However, it is mentioned that the research uses machine learning algorithms like backpropagation and the Gumbel softmax function to handle missing data and make the update criterion differentiable.

Therefore, while the provided context does not mention the use of standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it does describe the use of a custom dataset related to forest fires and their impact on the environment.
