In the provided context, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. This is mentioned when discussing the training of the model, where it is stated that "it is important to provide not only the class of the object but also the bounding box data of the object as correct answer." The bounding box data includes the x and y coordinates, width, and height of the object, in this case, fish, in the imageâ€™s dataset.

Instance segmentation, which involves creating a mask for each instance of an object in an image, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is possible that this technique was also used in addition to bounding box annotation, as it is a common practice in object detection and image analysis tasks.

It is worth noting that the data annotation process is crucial for the success of deep learning models, as it provides the necessary information for the model to learn from. Additionally, the use of data augmentation techniques, such as horizontal flipping, grayscale, blur, noise, and cropping, helps to extend the amount of data and acts as a regularizer, reducing the risk of overfitting.

In summary, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline described in the provided context is bounding box annotation, and it is possible that instance segmentation was also used. Data augmentation techniques were used to extend the amount of data and reduce the risk of overfitting.
