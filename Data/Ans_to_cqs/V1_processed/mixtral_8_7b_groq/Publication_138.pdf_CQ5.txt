The context provided does not specify the datasets used in the deep learning pipelines for the models discussed, such as LeNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGGNet, and ResNet. However, it is mentioned that GoogLeNet is the winner of ILSVRC 2014, which suggests that ImageNet was used as the dataset in that case. ImageNet is a large-scale dataset consisting of over 14 million images, distributed across 1000 object classes, and is widely used in the computer vision community for object recognition tasks.

Additionally, LeNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for handwritten digit recognition, and it is often trained on the MNIST dataset, a dataset of 60,000 training and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of MNIST for LeNet.

Therefore, while ImageNet and MNIST are two common datasets used in deep learning pipelines, the context provided does not explicitly state which datasets were used for the models discussed.
