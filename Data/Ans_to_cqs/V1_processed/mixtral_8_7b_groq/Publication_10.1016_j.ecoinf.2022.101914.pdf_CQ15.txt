The provided context discusses the optimization of the number of background points used to train individual models and ensemble models in a study. However, it does not mention any specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.

The study uses six modeling approaches, categorized into regression-based and machine learning models, to train component models for the ultimate ensemble models. These models include Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Maximum Entropy software (MaxEnt). Among these, ANN can be considered a deep learning model.

For each modeling algorithm, the study compares AUCs between the three background point selections and selects the model with the highest AUC as the "optimal" number of background points for that particular algorithm for this data. This process helps in optimizing the performance of individual models and ensemble models.

However, the context does not provide information on optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as learning rate scheduling, momentum, or adaptive methods like Adam. These optimization techniques are crucial for training deep learning models, like ANN, to converge to optimal solutions and prevent getting stuck in local minima.

In summary, the provided context discusses the optimization of background points for individual and ensemble models but does not mention any optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam.
