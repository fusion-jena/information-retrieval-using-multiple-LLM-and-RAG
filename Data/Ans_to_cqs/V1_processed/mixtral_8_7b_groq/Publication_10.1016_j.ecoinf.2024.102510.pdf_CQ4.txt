The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include horizontal and vertical translations, and shear distortion. Specifically, horizontal and vertical translations were performed within a range of 30 pixels, allowing random shifts. Shear distortion was applied within a range of 5, representing maximum distortion to the left and right. However, other common data augmentation techniques such as flipping and rotation were not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it can be inferred that flipping and rotation were not among the data augmentation techniques employed in this particular study.
