While the provided context does not contain direct information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does offer some insights into related topics such as the use of random seed values in other computational models.

In the study by Shi et al. (2020), machine learning techniques were used to attribute climate and human activities to vegetation change in China. However, the specific methods used to handle randomness in these techniques are not discussed.

Similarly, in the study by Spadoni et al. (2020), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) multi-temporal series were analyzed for the production of forest cartography, but the randomness aspect is not addressed.

The study by Verification of novel integrations of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning neural network for flood susceptibility mapping (2019) does not provide information on handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

However, in the field of computational modeling, random seed values are often used to handle randomness. A random seed value is a starting point for the random number generator, which ensures that the same sequence of random numbers is produced every time the model is run with the same seed value. This can be useful for reproducibility and comparability of results.

In summary, while the provided context does not contain direct information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is common practice in computational modeling to use random seed values to handle randomness. However, the specific methods used to handle randomness in deep learning models are not discussed in the provided context.
