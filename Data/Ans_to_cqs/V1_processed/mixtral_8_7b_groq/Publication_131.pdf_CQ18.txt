The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of proper databases for Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) training and evaluating the performance of the CNN based on several factors. 

During the training phase, the network is trained with data collected from sensor nodes, which are audio waves. The training process involves two stages. In the first stage, human supervision is required to identify every output with its correct pattern. This stage is crucial for ensuring the accuracy of the model as it learns to recognize patterns from the training data. In the second stage, the network is run with the trained supervised neural network.

To evaluate the performance of the CPS, several factors were considered, including data transport communication. A comparison was carried out between two paradigms: the central paradigm and the distributed paradigm. The central paradigm involves sending the audio record from an IoT node to its digital twin at the cyber system side for processing. On the other hand, the distributed paradigm involves processing the audio record in the IoT node and sending the obtained result to its digital twin for delivery to the central processing entity.

The network performance was evaluated based on a 5-second audio register recorded with a sample rate of 44.1 kHz and 32 bits per sample. The network achieved the best training results with six epochs and a batch size equal to 32 for both networks. The initial learning rate was set to 0.001, and the "adam" optimizer was used in the training process.

Additionally, the cyber system was responsible for interacting with a final user (biologist) who orders new trainings of the CNNs and new updates of the trained CNNs on the physical nodes or their digital twins for simulations or cooperative classifications. This interaction allows for continuous monitoring and improvement of the model's performance.

Therefore, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves a combination of human supervision, data transport communication comparison, and interaction with a final user for continuous monitoring and improvement.
