Based on the provided context, there is no direct information given about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context includes several citations for the studies published in the Ecological Informatics journal in 2024 by Gu et al., however, none of these citations mention a code repository link.

The context does mention that the study focuses on vegetation growth in the MRB (Mekong River Basin) and the attribution of vegetation growth to various latent variables, including climate, human activity, and terrain. The study also mentions the use of a deep learning pipeline, but there is no information provided about where the code for this pipeline can be found.

Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. If the code repository link is available, it should be included in the study's documentation or accompanying materials. I would recommend checking the full text of the study or contacting the authors directly for more information.
