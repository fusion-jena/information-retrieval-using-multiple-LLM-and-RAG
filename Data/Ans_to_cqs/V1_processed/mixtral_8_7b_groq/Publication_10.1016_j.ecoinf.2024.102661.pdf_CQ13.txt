The hyperparameters used in deep learning models can vary depending on the specific type of model being employed. In the context provided, the focus is on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models, a type of recurrent neural network. While the text does not explicitly list all the hyperparameters, it does mention some key ones.

The number of hidden layers is one such hyperparameter. This is crucial for the network's performance and helps the model capture complex patterns. The range for the number of hidden layers is set between 1 and 3 in this case.

The hyperparameter optimization process for LSTM neural networks is conceptualized as a black-box function where diverse hyperparameter combinations are the inputs and the optimization targets are the outputs aimed at minimizing the objective metric. This black-box approach facilitates the establishment of a direct link between hyperparameter sets and the network's optimization goals. However, the specific hyperparameters are not specified in this context.

In general, other hyperparameters that are commonly adjusted in deep learning models include the learning rate, the type of optimizer, the number of units in each layer, the activation function, the batch size, the number of epochs, and regularization parameters like dropout rate or L2 regularization weight.

The TPEBO (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator with Bayesian Optimization) algorithm, as mentioned in the context, is used for strategically optimizing these hyperparameters. It starts with an exploratory phase of random searches for feasible hyperparameter configurations, then progressively narrows down its focus to zones within the search space where a local optimum is identified, approximating the global optimum with increasing precision.

So, while the specific hyperparameters for the LSTM model in the given context are not explicitly listed, it can be inferred that they would include typical hyperparameters like the learning rate, optimizer, number of units in each layer, batch size, and number of epochs, which would be optimized using the TPEBO algorithm.
