I don't have enough information to provide specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model since the context focuses on the data processing and sample selection for training a machine learning model, specifically Support Vector Machine (SVM), rather than a deep learning model.

However, I can provide some general insights about hyperparameters that are commonly used in deep learning models. These hyperparameters include:

1. Learning rate: This is a hyperparameter that controls the size of the steps that the model takes while going through the training process. Common learning rate values include 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001.
2. Optimizer: This is a hyperparameter that determines the strategy used for updating the model's weights based on the gradients. Common optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.
3. Number of layers and number of neurons per layer: These are hyperparameters that determine the architecture of the deep learning model.
4. Activation function: This is a hyperparameter that determines the non-linear transformation applied to the inputs of each layer. Common activation functions include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh.
5. Batch size: This is a hyperparameter that determines the number of samples processed before the model's weights are updated.

It's important to note that the selection of these hyperparameters can significantly impact the performance of deep learning models. Therefore, it's common to use techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to find the best set of hyperparameters for a given problem.
