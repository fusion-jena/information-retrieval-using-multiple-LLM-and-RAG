The performance of the deep learning models in image classification tasks is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix. These metrics are chosen based on the specific requirements and characteristics of the task.

Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified images out of the total number of images. It provides a general overview of the model's performance. Precision, on the other hand, measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances in the data. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced assessment of both measures.

A confusion matrix is used to tabulate the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative counts. It offers a detailed breakdown of the model's performance and helps visualize how well the deep learning model is classifying different classes of images.

In the study, the datasets were divided randomly into three parts for training, validation, and testing, with 60% of the data used for training, 20% for validation, and the remaining 20% for evaluating the models' performance.

For the traditional approach, the images were resized to 256 Ã— 256 and used to train ten deep learning models, including MobileNetV2, VGG16, VGG19, ResNet-50, Inception-V3, Inception-ResNetV2, Xception, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, and DenseNet201. The performance of these models was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, along with a confusion matrix.

In summary, the performance of deep learning models in image classification tasks is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix. These metrics offer a comprehensive understanding of the models' performance, enabling researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions about their applicability in specific tasks.
