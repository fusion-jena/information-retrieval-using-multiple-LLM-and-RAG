Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in this particular study utilizes image data. The network is trained with mean scaled absolute error as the regression loss, using a batch size of 1 and an input image resolution of 5. The image size used for training is 1536 Ã— 768 pixels. Furthermore, the comparison is made with a ResNet50 model pre-trained on the ImageNet classification dataset, which also handles image data. Therefore, in this specific pipeline, image data is used for deep learning tasks. However, the context does not provide information about the use of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV.
