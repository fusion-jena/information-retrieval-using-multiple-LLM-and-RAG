The text provided discusses the training process of a deep learning model for ecological data analysis but does not explicitly mention the steps taken to deploy the trained model. However, based on common practices in deep learning, we can infer some possible steps that might have been taken.



After training the deep learning model using a combination of pre-training with external acoustic reference data and fine-tuning with ROI data from their study site, the researchers would likely have saved the trained model's weights and architecture to a file, a process known as model serialization. This allows them to later load the model and use it for inference without having to retrain the model from scratch.

To deploy the model, they would need to choose a platform that suits their needs. This could be a local machine, a server, or a cloud-based platform. The choice of platform would depend on factors such as the volume of data to be processed, the required inference speed, and the available resources.

Once the platform is chosen, they would load the serialized model and prepare the input data for inference. This might involve pre-processing the data in the same way as they did during training, such as padding short audio clips to a fixed length and combining different vocalizations of the same species into a single class.

Finally, they would feed the pre-processed data into the loaded model to obtain the predictions. The model would output the predicted species for each input audio clip, and the researchers could then use these predictions for further analysis.

It's worth noting that the text does not provide enough information to confirm these steps, and there might be additional steps involved in deploying the model depending on the specific requirements of the project.
