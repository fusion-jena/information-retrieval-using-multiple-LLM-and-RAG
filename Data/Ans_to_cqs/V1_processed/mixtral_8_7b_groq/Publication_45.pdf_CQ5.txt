In the context provided, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. The example used to explain deep learning in ecological prediction is based on bark beetle outbreaks in conifer forests. However, it does not specify the exact datasets used for training and testing the deep neural network.

In general, the choice of datasets in deep learning pipelines can vary widely depending on the specific application. Some popular datasets used in deep learning research include MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, CIFAR for image classification, and ImageNet for large-scale object recognition. These datasets are widely used in the computer vision community and have been critical in advancing the field of deep learning.

In the context of ecological prediction, the datasets used could be any relevant data related to the ecological process being modeled. For example, in the case of bark beetle outbreaks, the dataset could include historical data on beetle populations, forest characteristics, and environmental factors such as temperature and precipitation.

It's important to note that the choice of dataset is just one aspect of the deep learning pipeline. Other important factors include the network architecture, training algorithm, and evaluation metrics. The combination of these factors will ultimately determine the accuracy and effectiveness of the deep learning model for a given ecological prediction task.
