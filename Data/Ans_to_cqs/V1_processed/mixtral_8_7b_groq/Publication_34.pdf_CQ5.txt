The context provided does not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the deep learning models (SNN, DNN, and CNN) were fitted using the package mxnet. The CNN model is composed of two hidden convolutional layers and one fully connected layer, suggesting that the input data is likely to be image data. However, the specific datasets used for training and testing the models are not mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question without additional information.
