Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes a description of a survey of weed datasets and a table of hyperparameter settings for three detection models (YOLOX, YOLOv8, and SGD), but it does not mention any data repository or link to access the deep learning pipeline. The context also includes references to various papers and a GitHub link for a YOLOX issue, but none of these provide the requested information. Therefore, I am unable to provide a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
