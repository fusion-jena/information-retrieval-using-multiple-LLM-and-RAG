The text provided does not directly mention the use of a random seed value in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of randomization in the context of dividing the dataset into training and test sets. This is done to ensure that both subsets are representative of the overall dataset and to minimize the risk of bias. Randomization helps to preserve the distribution of key features and target variables across both training and test sets, enhancing the generalizability of the model.

In addition, the text mentions the use of GridSearchCV, which is a function in the scikit-learn library that can be used for hyperparameter tuning. This function uses randomized search for hyperparameter optimization, which can help to reduce overfitting and improve the performance of the model.

Furthermore, the text mentions the use of cross-validation, which is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into k folds, where k-1 folds are used for training and one fold is used for testing. This process is repeated k times, with a different fold used for testing each time. This can help to reduce the impact of randomness on the performance of the model, as each data point is used for testing multiple times.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value in the deep learning pipeline, it does discuss the use of randomization in dividing the dataset and in hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, the use of cross-validation can help to reduce the impact of randomness on the performance of the model.
