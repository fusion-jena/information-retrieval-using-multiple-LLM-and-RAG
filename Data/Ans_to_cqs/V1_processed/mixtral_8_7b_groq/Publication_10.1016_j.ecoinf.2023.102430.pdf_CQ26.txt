The provided context discusses the use of various machine learning algorithms for classifying insect species, but it does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the database was divided into training and testing sets, which suggests that some form of data splitting was used.

Data splitting is a common technique used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of models and to prevent overfitting. Stratified sampling is a type of data splitting that can be used to ensure that each subset of the data (e.g., training and testing sets) contains a similar proportion of examples from each class. This can help to prevent bias in the model's performance, especially if some classes are underrepresented in the data.

Other techniques that can be used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include oversampling and undersampling. Oversampling involves increasing the number of examples from underrepresented classes, while undersampling involves decreasing the number of examples from overrepresented classes. These techniques can help to balance the class distribution in the data and improve the model's performance.

Diverse data collection is another technique that can be used to address data bias. This involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population of interest. This can help to ensure that the model is able to generalize well to new, unseen data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that some form of data splitting, such as stratified sampling, was used. Other techniques, such as oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, can also be used to address data bias and improve the performance of machine learning models.
