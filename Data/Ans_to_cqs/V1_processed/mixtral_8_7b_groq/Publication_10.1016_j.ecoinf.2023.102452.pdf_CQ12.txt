The type of deep learning models used in the pipeline are Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and ConvLSTM. These models are used for hourly short-term streamflow forecasting. LSTM and ConvLSTM are types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) that are particularly well-suited for time series data due to their ability to maintain an internal state that captures information about previous inputs. CNNs, on the other hand, are feedforward neural networks that have been successful in various tasks such as image and speech recognition. They are used in this study for their ability to extract local features from the input data. ConvLSTM, as the name suggests, is a combination of CNN and LSTM, which combines the spatial feature learning capability of CNNs and the temporal dynamics learning capability of LSTMs.
