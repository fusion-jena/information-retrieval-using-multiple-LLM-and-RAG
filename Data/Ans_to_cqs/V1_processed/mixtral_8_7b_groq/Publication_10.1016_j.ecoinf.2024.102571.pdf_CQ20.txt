Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context focuses on the development and application of an artificial neural network (ANN) model for predicting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from urban domestic wastewater treatment systems (UDWTTS), but it does not mention any details about the hardware used for training the model.

However, it is mentioned that a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network with a 30-20-10 architecture was developed, and the activation functions used were tansig, tansig, and purelin. The input factors for the model were population size and GDP, and the predicted output was GHGdwts. The data were divided into 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for model testing.

It is common practice to use powerful hardware resources such as graphics processing units (GPUs) or tensor processing units (TPUs) for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel computations and handle large datasets efficiently. However, the context does not provide information on whether such hardware resources were used in this particular case.
