Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. The text mentions that Random Forest was used to build the prediction models, but it does not give details about the optimization of the model's hyperparameters.

Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves systematically trying out different combinations of hyperparameters. Random search, on the other hand, involves randomly selecting hyperparameters to try out. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic model to make informed decisions about which hyperparameters to try next.

It's possible that the authors used one of these methods, or another method entirely, to optimize the hyperparameters of their models. However, without additional information, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer.

In summary, while the text provides information about the models used and the performance of those models, it does not provide information about how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized.
