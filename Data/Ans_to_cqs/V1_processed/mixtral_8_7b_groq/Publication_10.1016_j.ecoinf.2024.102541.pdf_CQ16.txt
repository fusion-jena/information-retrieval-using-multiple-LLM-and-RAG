The context provided does not give explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this particular instance. However, it is common in machine learning and computer vision tasks for training to be considered complete when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly, indicating that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the data to the best of its ability given the current architecture and parameters. Additionally, early stopping strategies may be employed to prevent overfitting, where training would be stopped before a plateau if performance on a validation set starts to degrade. The choice of criteria depends on various factors, including the specific task, the model architecture, and the data available.
