The criteria used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the training process for TensorFlow involved exploring different numbers of training steps and comparing results to find an optimum balance between computing time and classification efficiency. A validation percentage was also modified during the training process.

In the context, it is mentioned that for the training process, two parameters of the model were modified: (1) number of training steps, and (2) validation percentage. The researchers explored different numbers of training steps and compared results to find an optimum balance between computing time and classification efficiency. Given their limited number of images per species (n = 20), they increased the validation parameter to 20%. A leave-one-out cross validation technique was used to evaluate model performance in some of the classification challenges.

However, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau or convergence of the model, is not provided in the context. It can be assumed that the researchers used a combination of training time, classification efficiency, and validation accuracy to determine when training was complete. But, it is not explicitly stated in the given context.
