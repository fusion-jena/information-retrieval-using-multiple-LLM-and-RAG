Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, it is mentioned that modeling packages often include automated tuning for parameters through resampling and standard default values. This suggests that there may be automated ways to find the best hyperparameter values within the modeling packages used.

Moreover, the text highlights that, in the case of random forests, the largest trees possible typically result in the best accuracy, and fine-tuning parameters is usually unnecessary to achieve accurate performance. This implies that, for random forests, there might not be a need for extensive hyperparameter optimization.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific details on hyperparameter optimization methods like grid search or random search, it does suggest that automated tuning may be included in the modeling packages used and that, for random forests, large trees without much fine-tuning often yield the best accuracy.
