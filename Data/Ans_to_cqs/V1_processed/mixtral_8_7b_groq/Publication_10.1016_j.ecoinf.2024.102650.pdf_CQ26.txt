The provided context discusses the preprocessing steps for text data in the context of a deep learning pipeline, but it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer based on the given context.

However, I can provide some general techniques that are commonly used to address data bias during preprocessing in a deep learning pipeline:

1. Stratified sampling: Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures each stratum (or subset) of the population is proportionally represented in the sample. This technique can be used during the splitting of data into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure that each set has a similar distribution of classes or labels.
2. Oversampling: Oversampling is a technique used to increase the representation of the minority class in the dataset. This can be done by replicating instances of the minority class or by generating synthetic instances using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Undersampling: Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the representation of the majority class in the dataset. This can be done by randomly selecting instances from the majority class or by using techniques such as NearMiss to select instances that are close to the decision boundary.
4. Diverse data collection: Diverse data collection involves gathering data from multiple sources or perspectives to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help to reduce bias by ensuring that the dataset includes a wide range of variations and perspectives.

It's important to note that addressing data bias is an ongoing process throughout the entire deep learning pipeline, not just during preprocessing. Techniques such as bias mitigation algorithms, fairness metrics, and model explainability can be used throughout the pipeline to ensure that the model is fair and unbiased.
