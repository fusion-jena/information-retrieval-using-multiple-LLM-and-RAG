I don't know. The provided context discusses the use of a Python implementation of the XGBoostClassifier for classifying very high-resolution (VHR) images, but it does not mention any deep learning models or their hyperparameters. XGBoost is a gradient boosting algorithm, not a deep learning algorithm. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), typically have hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons per layer, and type of activation function. However, these hyperparameters are not mentioned in the provided context.
