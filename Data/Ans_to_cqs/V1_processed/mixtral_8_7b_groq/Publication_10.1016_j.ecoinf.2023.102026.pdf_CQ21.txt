Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training for species distribution modeling. However, it does mention that bootstrapping the training data can increase the precision of the models. Bootstrapping is a resampling technique that involves creating multiple subsets of the original data with replacement, fitting a model to each subset, and then combining the results to estimate the final model. This process can help to reduce stochastic errors in estimation.

In the context of species distribution modeling, some common postprocessing steps after model training include:

1. Saliency maps: These are visualizations that highlight the areas of the input space that the model considers most important for predicting the presence or absence of a species. Saliency maps can be useful for understanding which features of the environment are most strongly associated with the species' distribution.
2. Metrics calculation: After fitting a model, it is important to evaluate its performance using various metrics. Common metrics for species distribution models include accuracy, precision, recall, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). These metrics can help to assess the model's ability to predict the presence or absence of a species.
3. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a binary classification model. It shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. The confusion matrix can be used to calculate various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

It's important to note that the specific postprocessing steps may vary depending on the modeling technique used and the research question being addressed. Therefore, it's always a good idea to consult the relevant literature and guidelines for best practices when conducting species distribution modeling.
