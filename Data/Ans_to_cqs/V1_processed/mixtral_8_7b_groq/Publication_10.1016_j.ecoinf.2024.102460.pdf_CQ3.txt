Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does mention the use of land type conversion drivers and a land type expansion raster in a study related to land use and land cover change. It can be inferred that some form of annotation or labeling was done to create these drivers and raster data.

In the context of land use and land cover change, common annotation techniques include:

1. Land use/land cover classification: This involves categorizing pixels or regions in remote sensing images into different land use or land cover classes, such as forest, urban, agricultural land, etc.
2. Object-based image analysis (OBIA): This method involves segmenting an image into homogeneous regions or objects, followed by classification of these objects into different land use or land cover classes.
3. Pixel-based image analysis: This method involves classifying individual pixels in remote sensing images based on their spectral characteristics.

For deep learning applications, more advanced annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation might be used. However, the provided context does not contain specific details about these techniques being used in the deep learning pipeline.
