In the context provided, there is no specific list of metrics given for evaluating the performance of a deep learning model. However, based on general practices in machine learning and deep learning, common metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions (relevant items that are correctly identified) to the total predicted positives (all items predicted to be relevant, regardless of whether they are actually relevant or not). Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of relevant items. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a single metric that encapsulates both.

These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models in various domains, including smart farming. In the smart farming domain, deep learning models can be used for various applications such as crop yield prediction, disease detection, and livestock monitoring. The choice of evaluation metric depends on the specific problem and the business objectives. For example, if the objective is to minimize false negatives (i.e., not detecting a disease when it is present), recall would be a more important metric than precision.

It is also important to note that deep learning models can be complex and may require large amounts of data to train effectively. Therefore, it is important to use appropriate data management and analytics techniques to handle the volume, velocity, and variety of the generated data by the sensors and IoT devices. As mentioned in the context, traditional data management systems may be inadequate to handle these data characteristics, and advanced data management techniques such as edge and cloud computing may be required.

In summary, while the context does not provide a specific list of metrics for evaluating the performance of deep learning models in smart farming, common metrics used in machine learning and deep learning include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The choice of evaluation metric depends on the specific problem and the business objectives. Advanced data management techniques may be required to handle the large volumes of data generated by sensors and IoT devices in the smart farming domain.
