The provided context discusses the evaluation of machine learning models (MLMs) for predicting forest fires, but it does not explicitly mention a deep learning model. However, I will provide an answer based on typical metrics used to evaluate predictive models.



The query asks about the evaluation metrics used for deep learning models, but the context focuses on machine learning models (MLMs) for predicting forest fires. Nonetheless, I will provide an answer based on common evaluation metrics for predictive models, which can be applied to both MLMs and deep learning models.

Typical evaluation metrics for predictive models include:

1. Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions.
2. Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
3. Recall (Sensitivity): The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.
4. F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
5. Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC): A threshold-independent metric that measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.
6. Kappa: A statistical measure that accounts for agreement between predicted and actual classes, considering chance agreement.
7. True Skill Statistics (TSS): A threshold-dependent skill score that measures the model's performance in binary classification tasks.

In the provided context, the evaluation metrics mentioned are AUC, TSS, Kappa, and phi. Phi is a measure of association for two binary variables, similar to Cohen's kappa. The context does not mention accuracy, precision, or recall, but these metrics are commonly used for evaluating predictive models, including deep learning models.
