I am unable to provide a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline related to the provided research papers because none of the papers mention or provide a link to such a resource. The papers mainly focus on environmental science topics such as Microcystis decomposition, dissolved organic matter, and the impact of climate change on lakes. While some of them use statistical or machine learning methods for data analysis, they do not describe a deep learning pipeline.

If you are looking for a deep learning pipeline related to environmental science or any other specific topic, I would recommend searching for relevant repositories on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. You can use keywords related to the topic and deep learning techniques (e.g., "LSTM lake water quality", "Convolutional Neural Network dissolved organic matter") to find a suitable code repository.
