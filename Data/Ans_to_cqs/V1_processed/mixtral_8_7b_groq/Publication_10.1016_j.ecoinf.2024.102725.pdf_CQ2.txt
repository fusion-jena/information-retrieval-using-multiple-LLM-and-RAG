Based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is primarily images, specifically Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images. NDVI is a commonly used vegetation index that estimates the level of vegetation by using the visible and near-infrared bands of the electromagnetic spectrum.

In the study by Wang et al., 2023, the authors use deep-learning enhanced fusion methods for improved NDVI reconstruction and long-term vegetation cover study in the Danjiang River basin. They employ four evaluation metrics, including RMSE, to assess and contrast the disparities between the predicted and actual NDVI images.

Similarly, in the study by Li et al., 2022, the authors use a deep learning-based fusion of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images to reconstruct vegetation NDVI time series in cloud-prone regions. They also use NDVI images as input data for their deep learning model.

Moreover, Mao et al., 2023, use SAR-optical fusion with spatio-temporal partitioning and multiple linear regression to reconstruct cloud-contaminated NDVI images. They use NDVI images as input data for their deep learning model.

Furthermore, Pipia et al., 2019, use multioutput Gaussian processes to fuse optical and SAR time series for LAI gap filling. They use NDVI images as input data for their deep learning model.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline in these studies is primarily NDVI images. However, it is important to note that the specific data format may vary depending on the application and the deep learning model used.
