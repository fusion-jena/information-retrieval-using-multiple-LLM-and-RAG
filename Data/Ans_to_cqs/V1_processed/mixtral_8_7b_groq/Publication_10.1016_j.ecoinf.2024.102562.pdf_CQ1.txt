The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data is collected through microfluidic platforms in a soil-analogue environment. Microfluidic platforms are tools that manipulate small volumes of fluids, usually in the range of picoliters to microliters (Whitesides, 2006). In this case, these platforms are used to study the bacterial abundance and morphology in a soil-analogue environment.

Additionally, the authors mention that they used three sampling locations (Greenland, Sweden, and Kenya) to demonstrate the versatility of their approach. These sampling sites exhibit noticeable differences in bacterial abundance and morphology, which were utilized as a validation set to assess the efficacy of their deep learning recognition model. Therefore, it can be inferred that the raw data was collected from these three sampling locations using microfluidic platforms.

It is important to note that the authors do not mention any other sources of data, such as public datasets or sensors. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the data was collected specifically for this study using microfluidic platforms.
