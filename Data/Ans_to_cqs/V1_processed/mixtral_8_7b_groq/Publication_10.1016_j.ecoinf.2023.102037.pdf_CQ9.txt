The provided context does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The sources mainly discuss various methods and techniques used for crop pests image classification and insect identification using deep convolutional neural networks.

In Wang et al. (2017), the authors proposed a crop pests image classification algorithm based on a deep convolutional neural network, but they do not mention the data repository. Wang et al. (2020a, 2020b, 2020c) obtained a mean Average Precision (mAP) score of 63.54% using YOLOv3 while detecting and classifying pest species from images in their "Pest24" dataset. However, there is no information about the data repository.

Rustia et al. (2021) designed a multi-stage deep learning method for insect identification, but the context does not mention the data repository. Similarly, Hong et al. (2021) developed an AI-based pest counting method for monitoring the black pine bast scale, but there is no information about the data repository in the context.

The figure (Figure 5) illustrates the procedure for separating data into training, validation, and test sets, and tiling sticky plate images by finding regions of interest of a fixed size (512x512 pixels) that contain the maximum number of complete bounding boxes. However, it does not provide information about the data repository.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not available or mentioned.
