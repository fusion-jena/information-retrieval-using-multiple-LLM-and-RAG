The provided context does not discuss the specific data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. However, it does mention the use of remote sensing data and machine learning algorithms for crop classification, specifically the random forest classification method used for rice-growing area extraction. In the context of remote sensing and geospatial analysis, common data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding box annotation: Drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in an image. This technique is useful for object detection tasks.
2. Polygon annotation: Drawing polygons around objects of interest, which can be more precise than bounding boxes, especially for irregularly shaped objects. This technique is often used for semantic segmentation tasks.
3. Pixel-level annotation: Labeling each pixel in an image according to the object or class it belongs to. This technique is used for dense pixel-wise labeling tasks, such as semantic segmentation.
4. Instance segmentation: A combination of object detection and semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and assigned a unique identifier.

In the context of the provided study, the data annotation technique used for rice-growing area extraction is not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the study used a combination of bounding box annotation (for identifying the general location of rice-growing areas) and pixel-level annotation (for accurately classifying each pixel within the rice-growing areas).

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query, common data annotation techniques for deep learning pipelines include bounding box annotation, polygon annotation, pixel-level annotation, and instance segmentation. The specific data annotation technique used in the study for rice-growing area extraction can be inferred to be a combination of bounding box and pixel-level annotation.
