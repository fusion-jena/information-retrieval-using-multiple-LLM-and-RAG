The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model. The research primarily focuses on the classification of fish freshness using machine learning techniques and organoleptic parameters. However, it does specify the use of clustering for determining freshness classes, with the number of clusters ranging from 2 to 10.

In the clustering process, the only mentioned hyperparameter is the distance metric, which is the Euclidean distance. This choice is based on the uniform data range. The text suggests potential future research on exploring alternative distance metrics, which could influence the quality of freshness class determination.

As for the deep learning model-specific hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, or neurons per layer, these are not mentioned or discussed in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer based on the given information.
