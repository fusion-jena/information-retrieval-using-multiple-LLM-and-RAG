Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the training process involves iterating through the audio classification loss network's layers and adjusting parameters based on the weighted L1 distance between the clean bird sound signal (β) and the processed bird sound signal (g(x; θ)) generated by the noise reduction network.

The loss function is defined as the sum of the weighted L1 distances between the feature activations of the clean and processed bird sound signals across the first M layers of the audio classification loss network. The weights (λm) are initially set to 1 and are adjusted after 10 training iterations based on the reciprocal of the L1 distance between the feature activations of the clean and processed bird sound signals.

It is possible that the training process is designed to continue until a certain level of convergence is reached in the loss function or until a predetermined number of training iterations have been completed. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.

In general, training of machine learning models is often determined to be complete when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly, indicating that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data and is unlikely to improve further with additional training. Other criteria for determining training completion may include a predetermined number of training epochs or a maximum amount of time allocated for training.

In summary, while the provided context does not give explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, it is possible that the training process continues until a certain level of convergence is reached in the loss function or until a predetermined number of training iterations have been completed. In general, training of machine learning models is often determined to be complete when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly.
