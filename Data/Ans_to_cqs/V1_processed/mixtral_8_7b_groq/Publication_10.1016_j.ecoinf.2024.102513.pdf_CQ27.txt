The text provided does not give detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the calculations were performed on a specific laptop model with a particular CPU, memory, and graphics card. This suggests that the model was run and tested on this local machine.

Additionally, the text mentions the use of the sklearn library for accuracy calculation, which is a Python library commonly used for machine learning tasks, including model evaluation and validation. This implies that the model was developed and trained using Python and possibly a deep learning library or framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

As for model serialization, there is no explicit information in the text. Model serialization is the process of saving a trained model to disk so that it can be loaded and used later without having to retrain the model. This is a common practice in deep learning projects, as it allows for easier deployment and sharing of models. It is possible that the project involved model serialization, but the text does not provide enough information to confirm this.

In summary, while the text provides some details about the platform used for running and testing the model, it does not give a clear description of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, including model serialization.
