Based on the provided context, the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for aquatic ecosystem health estimation are not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer that a combination of sensors and ecological monitoring data is likely used.

For instance, the context mentions the use of deep learning algorithms for estimating aquatic ecosystem health, with a focus on variables such as water quality, streamflow, and algae. These variables are typically measured using specialized sensors and monitoring equipment deployed in the aquatic environment.

In addition, one of the references (Jo et al., 2015) discusses a health assessment of the Nakdong river basin aquatic ecosystems utilizing GIS and spatial statistics. GIS (Geographic Information Systems) often relies on spatial data collected from sensors, remote sensing, and other geographical data sources. Therefore, it is plausible that sensor data and other geographical information are used as raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

Furthermore, the context highlights the potential of deep learning techniques for investigating parts of ecosystems beyond the constraining quantitative and qualitative indices. This suggests that various forms of data, including sensor data, ecological monitoring data, and possibly even remote sensing data, are used in the deep learning pipeline to estimate aquatic ecosystem health.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for aquatic ecosystem health estimation, it is likely that a combination of sensors and ecological monitoring data is used. Additionally, GIS and spatial statistics may also play a role in data collection and preprocessing.
