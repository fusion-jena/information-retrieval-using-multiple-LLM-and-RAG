The provided context discusses techniques for improving the precision of species distribution models (SDMs) using machine learning algorithms, particularly random forests, and resampling methods such as bootstrapping. However, it does not directly mention techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.

In the context of machine learning and deep learning, data bias can occur when certain classes or categories of data are overrepresented or underrepresented in the training data, leading to inaccurate or biased models. To address data bias during preprocessing, several techniques can be employed:

1. **Stratified sampling**: This technique involves dividing the data into strata based on the class labels and then randomly sampling from each stratum to ensure that each class is represented proportionally in the training data.
2. **Oversampling**: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of the underrepresented class in the training data, either by duplicating instances or by generating synthetic instances using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. **Undersampling**: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of the overrepresented class in the training data to match the number of instances of the underrepresented class.
4. **Diverse data collection**: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population of interest.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, it does discuss the importance of resampling methods such as bootstrapping for improving the precision of SDMs. Bootstrapping involves randomly sampling instances from the training data with replacement, which can help to reduce stochastic errors in estimation and improve the robustness of the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly address the query, techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Additionally, resampling methods such as bootstrapping can help to improve the precision and robustness of machine learning models.
