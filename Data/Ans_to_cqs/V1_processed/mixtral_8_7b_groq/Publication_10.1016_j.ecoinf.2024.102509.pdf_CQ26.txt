The provided context discusses the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in predicting ecological variables, but it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does touch upon some related concepts that can be used to infer potential approaches to handling data bias.

In the context, it is mentioned that the accuracy of ANN's training process relies on the quality and quantity of the sample dataset (Yang et al., 2018). This implies that having a diverse and representative dataset is crucial for the performance of the ANN. Therefore, techniques such as diverse data collection and stratified splitting can be used to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population and to prevent bias.

Stratified splitting is a technique used to divide a dataset into subsets that maintain the original dataset's distribution of classes or labels. This ensures that each subset has a similar proportion of samples from each class, reducing the chances of bias in the training and testing sets.

Diverse data collection refers to the process of gathering data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset includes a wide range of samples. This can help prevent bias by ensuring that the dataset includes samples from different demographics, locations, and conditions.

Additionally, the context also mentions the problem of over-fitting, which can occur when an ANN model has too many hidden layers or neurons. Over-fitting can lead to a model that performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. To address this, repeated training and testing are necessary to develop an optimal neural network and attain high accuracy.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, it does touch upon related concepts such as diverse data collection, stratified splitting, and over-fitting. These concepts can be used to infer potential approaches to handling data bias, such as collecting diverse data, using stratified splitting, and preventing over-fitting.
