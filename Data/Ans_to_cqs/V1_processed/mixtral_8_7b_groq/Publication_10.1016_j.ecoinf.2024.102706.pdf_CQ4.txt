The provided context does not directly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss various machine learning models and methods. Therefore, I will provide an answer based on general knowledge of deep learning data augmentation techniques.


In deep learning, data augmentation techniques are commonly applied to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by creating modified versions of the existing images. These techniques help improve model performance, reduce overfitting, and provide translation invariance. Some common data augmentation techniques in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Flipping: This technique creates a mirrored image by horizontally or vertically flipping the original image. Horizontal flipping is more common, as it helps the model generalize better without affecting the image's semantic meaning.

2. Rotation: Images are rotated by a certain angle, which can help the model learn features invariant to orientation. This technique can be useful for satellite or aerial images, where objects of interest may appear at various angles.

3. Scaling: Images are resized or scaled up or down, which can help the model learn features invariant to scale. Scaling can be particularly useful when dealing with objects of different sizes in the same image.

4. Translation: Images are shifted horizontally or vertically by a certain number of pixels. This technique can help the model learn features invariant to position.

5. Color jittering: This technique involves randomly changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue of the image. Color jittering can help the model learn features invariant to color variations and improve robustness.

6. Affine transformations: This technique combines rotation, scaling, and translation to create more diverse augmented images.

While the provided context does not discuss these data augmentation techniques, it is important to note that these methods are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to improve model performance and generalization.
