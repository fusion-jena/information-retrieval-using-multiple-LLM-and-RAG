The provided context does not include specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Landsat images for classifying invasive species, specifically Spartina alterniflora. In the context of remote sensing and image classification, data annotation techniques may include:

1. Image labeling: This involves assigning a class label to an entire image. For example, labeling an image as "invasive species present" or "invasive species absent."
2. Pixel-based classification: This technique involves labeling each individual pixel in an image with a class. This can be useful for identifying the distribution and extent of invasive species within an image.
3. Object detection: This involves identifying and locating objects within an image, often through the use of bounding boxes. This can be useful for tracking the spread of invasive species over time.
4. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves dividing an image into distinct regions or segments, with each segment assigned a class label. This can provide more detailed information about the distribution and shape of invasive species within an image.

It's important to note that the choice of data annotation technique will depend on the specific research question and the characteristics of the data. In the context of the provided articles, it's possible that a combination of these techniques was used to classify Landsat images and detect the presence of Spartina alterniflora. However, without more specific information, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
