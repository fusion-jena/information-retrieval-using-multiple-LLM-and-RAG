The specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Deep Learning methods were used for classification in the ecoacoustic assessment. Common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad.

The CNN used in the pipeline consisted of a series of layers that modified input data with parameterized mathematical operations optimized to improve classification performance. The optimization of these parameters could have been done using one of the aforementioned optimization techniques.

The CNN was implemented using Theano and Lasagne libraries, which support various optimization techniques. However, without explicit information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer regarding the specific optimization techniques used in this pipeline.
