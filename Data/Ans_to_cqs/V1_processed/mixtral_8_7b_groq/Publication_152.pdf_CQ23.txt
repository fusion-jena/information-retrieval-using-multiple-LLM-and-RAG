The text provided does not give explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does provide some contextual clues that suggest certain strategies may have been used.

Firstly, it is mentioned that the U-Net model was tested with multiple configurations, which implies some form of cross-validation or parameter tuning was performed to ensure the model's performance was not specific to a particular set of hyperparameters.

Secondly, the model was tested on images collected by UAV flights at a constant height above ground, with small changes in brightness and zoom. This suggests that some form of data augmentation was used to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's ability to generalize to new images.

Thirdly, the U-Net model was tested in a segmentation approach combined with training directly derived from the visual interpretation of high-resolution UAV-based RGB images for detailed mapping of vegetation species. The authors achieved at least 84% accuracy, suggesting that the model was able to generalize well to the task at hand.

Lastly, a method to segment drought areas and distinguish maize severity classification using RGB images captured by a UAV was proposed. The network used was U-NET with some structural and parameter improvements using SE-ResNet-50. When using RGB images as input for training, the final trained network could work with RGB images captured by a UAV. The results achieved an F1 score of 0.9034 and a Jaccard index of 0.8287 on the test set.

While these clues suggest that some measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the text does not provide explicit details about the strategies used. Therefore, it is not possible to give a definitive answer to this query based on the information provided.
