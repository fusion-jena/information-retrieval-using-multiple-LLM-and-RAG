The TensorFlow object detection API framework is used to build the deep learning model for the mobile-based crop pest recognition system. This is specified in the context where it is mentioned that "All experiments of our developed mobile-based crop pest recognition system were done using the TensorFlow object detection API framework [36] on a GPU of NVIDIA GAMINGX GTX 1080 8 GB and DDR4-16 GB memory." The specific version or implementation of TensorFlow is not mentioned, but it can be inferred that it is a version that is compatible with the NVIDIA GPU and the object detection API. Other frameworks such as PyTorch are not mentioned in the provided context.
