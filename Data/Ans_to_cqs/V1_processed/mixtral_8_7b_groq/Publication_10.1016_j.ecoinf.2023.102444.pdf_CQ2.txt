The provided context does not contain specific information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for dimensionality reduction in various fields such as genomics, image analysis, population ecology, and text processing. UMAP can be applied to different data formats, including structured data (e.g., CSV files) and unstructured data (e.g., images, audio, and video).

In the context of species distribution modeling based on remote sensing imagery, it is mentioned that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used to capture fine-grained and large-scale vegetation ecology. This implies the use of image data in the deep learning pipeline.

In another study, UMAP was used to visualize input data and the results of applying a CNN to model the distribution of species at a fine resolution. The input data could be bioclimatic variables, which are typically provided in tabular formats (e.g., CSV files).

Furthermore, UMAP has been applied in population genetics, where it can handle genomic data in formats such as VCF (Variant Call Format) or FASTA.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files, depending on the specific problem and data at hand. The context provided here specifically mentions the use of image data and tabular data (e.g., CSV files) in species distribution modeling and population genetics.
