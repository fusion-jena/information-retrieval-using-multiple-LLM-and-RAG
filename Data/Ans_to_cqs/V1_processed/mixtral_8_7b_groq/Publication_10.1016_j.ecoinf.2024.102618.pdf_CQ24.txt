The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of ensemble deep learning models for plant disease classification. Ensemble models combine the predictions of multiple base models to produce a final prediction, which can help reduce the impact of randomness and improve model performance.

Ensemble models can be created using various techniques, such as bagging, boosting, and stacking. Bagging involves creating multiple subsets of the training data by randomly sampling with replacement, and then training a base model on each subset. The final prediction is made by averaging the predictions of the base models. Boosting, on the other hand, involves training base models sequentially, with each model focusing on the samples that were misclassified by the previous model. The final prediction is made by combining the predictions of the base models. Stacking involves training base models on the entire training data and then combining their predictions using a meta-model.

In the context of plant disease classification, the authors created ten different ensembles of deep learning models and evaluated their performance. These ensembles were created using various combinations of state-of-the-art deep learning models, such as DenseNet201, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB3, InceptionResNetV2, and ResNet50v2. The authors found that the ensembles generally performed better than the individual base models, indicating that ensemble methods can be effective for handling randomness and improving model performance.

In addition to ensemble methods, other strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline include setting a fixed random seed value, using cross-validation, and using techniques such as dropout and regularization to prevent overfitting. However, these strategies are not mentioned in the provided context.
