I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided context does not contain information about the regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context focuses on the analysis of the MaxEnt model's output for Quercus pubescens Willd. and Quercus ilex subsp. ilex, presenting the relative contributions of environmental and territorial variables to the model.

To answer your query, I'll provide some information about common regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines:


 In deep learning pipelines, regularization methods are employed to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of models and promoting generalization. Two common regularization techniques are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization technique used during training to prevent over-reliance on individual neurons. It works by randomly dropping out, or "turning off," a proportion of neurons in a layer during each training iteration. This process encourages the network to learn more robust features and reduces overfitting.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a method that adds a penalty term to the loss function, proportional to the square of the model's weights. By increasing the loss for larger weights, L2 regularization discourages the model from assigning too much importance to specific features, thus reducing overfitting.

These regularization techniques can be applied in various deep learning architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and long short-term memory networks (LSTMs), to improve model performance and prevent overfitting.
