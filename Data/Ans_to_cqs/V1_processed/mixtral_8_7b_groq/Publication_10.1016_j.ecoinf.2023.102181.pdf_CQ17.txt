The provided context discusses the use of bagging, a machine learning technique, to minimize biased training of models with clustered data. However, it does not directly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization.

In the context, the authors use a bagging algorithm, specifically a random forest model, to train models on clustered data. While random forests do not explicitly use dropout or L2 regularization, they have their own built-in regularization mechanisms. Random forests reduce overfitting by averaging the results of many decision trees, each trained on a different subset of the data. This process, known as ensemble learning, helps to smooth out the individual decision trees' errors and biases.

Additionally, the random forest algorithm includes a feature selection step during the tree-building process. By only considering a subset of the features at each split, the algorithm reduces the likelihood of overfitting to noisy or irrelevant features. This behavior is similar to L1 regularization, which also aims to reduce the influence of less important features.

However, it is important to note that the provided context focuses on the challenges of biased training with clustered data and the use of covariance-weighted bagging as a potential solution. It does not directly address the query regarding regularization methods in deep learning pipelines.
