The performance of the deep learning models in the study is evaluated using balanced accuracy and weighted F1-score. Balanced accuracy is used to address the issue of class imbalance, which is common in bird sound classification where some bird species may have significantly more samples than others. It is calculated as the average of the recall (sensitivity) across all classes. On the other hand, the weighted F1-score is a measure of the harmonic mean of precision and recall, where the precision is the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions. The F1-score is calculated for each class and then averaged, weighted by the number of samples in each class. This is different from the regular F1-score, which calculates the F1-score for each class and then takes the unweighted average.

In addition to these two metrics, a confusion matrix is also used to provide a more detailed view of the model's performance. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predictions made by a classification model, with rows representing the true classes and columns representing the predicted classes. Each cell in the table contains the number of instances that belong to the true class (row) and were predicted to belong to the predicted class (column).

It is worth noting that while accuracy, precision, and recall are commonly used metrics for evaluating classification models, they are not used in this study. Instead, the authors chose balanced accuracy and weighted F1-score to better evaluate the model's performance in the context of bird sound classification.
