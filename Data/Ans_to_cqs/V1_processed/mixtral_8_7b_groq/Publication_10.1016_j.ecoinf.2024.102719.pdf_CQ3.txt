The provided context does not include specific information on data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of machine learning and deep learning models for river quality assessment. Common data annotation techniques used in deep learning, particularly for computer vision tasks, include:

1. Image labeling: Assigning a class label to an entire image.
2. Bounding box annotation: Drawing a box around an object of interest in an image and providing its class label.
3. Semantic segmentation: Dividing an image into multiple regions, each assigned a class label, indicating the category of the object or background present in that region.
4. Instance segmentation: A more advanced form of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is separated and assigned a unique class label, even if multiple instances of the same object appear in the image.
5. Landmark annotation: Identifying and labeling key points or landmarks on an object within an image, such as the corners of a bounding box or specific points on a human face.

These annotation techniques enable deep learning models to learn from large-scale, annotated datasets and improve their performance in various tasks, including image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
