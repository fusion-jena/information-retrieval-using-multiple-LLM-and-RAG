Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. However, the context does provide information about the development of high-spatial-resolution NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) datasets using deep-learning enhanced fusion methods.

In the 2023 Wang et al. study, the authors proposed a new technology framework called SOWCEM (Spatial-Temporal Optimal Weighted Consensus Fusion Method) for reconstructing cloud-free high-resolution NDVI datasets. This framework involves the use of two prediction models, and the optimal weighted allocation method calculates and allocates optimal weights for the prediction simulation results based on spatial and temporal dimensions. The algorithm minimizes the sum of squares of the combined prediction errors within a specific time period to achieve an optimal combination of prediction model results at the pixel scale. However, the context does not mention any details about model serialization or platform selection for deploying a deep learning model.

Similarly, the 2018 Bermudez et al. study presented a method for cloud removal using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to synthesize SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) to optical images. While the study discusses the development and training of the GAN model, there is no information about deploying the trained model for real-world applications.

In summary, while the provided context discusses the development and training of deep learning models for NDVI reconstruction and cloud removal, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained models, such as model serialization or platform selection.
