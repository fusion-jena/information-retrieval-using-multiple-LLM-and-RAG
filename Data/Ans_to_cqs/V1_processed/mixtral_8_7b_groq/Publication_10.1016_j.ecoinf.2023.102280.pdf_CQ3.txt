The provided context does not discuss specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for tasks such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does provide insights into data preparation and challenges in the bioacoustics domain, particularly in deep noise reduction methods.

In the context of bioacoustics and deep noise reduction, data preparation typically involves collecting clean recordings and superimposing noise profiles to create input data and a "denoised" ground truth. This process is challenging due to the infeasibility of collecting clean recordings in many cases and the sparsity of vocalisations, which makes creating large-scale datasets difficult.

As for deep learning-based denoising methods, they are commonly applied to natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as human speech enhancement. These methods typically operate on audio spectrograms, but recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning methods have successfully used raw waveform data for wider applications like source separation and classification. This approach eliminates errors introduced by applying a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for time-frequency representation and reconstruction errors due to the loss of phase information.

In summary, the provided context does not discuss data annotation techniques. Instead, it focuses on data preparation challenges in the bioacoustics domain and deep noise reduction techniques in NLP tasks.
