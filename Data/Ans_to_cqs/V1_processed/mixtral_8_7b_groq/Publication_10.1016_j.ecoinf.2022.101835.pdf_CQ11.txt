The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the comparison of machine learning algorithms, specifically Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), in predicting the first flowering date and full blossom date. It mentions the use of various libraries, such as Optuna, LightGBM, and SHAP, but it does not provide any details about the data repository or the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide the data repository link based on the given context.
