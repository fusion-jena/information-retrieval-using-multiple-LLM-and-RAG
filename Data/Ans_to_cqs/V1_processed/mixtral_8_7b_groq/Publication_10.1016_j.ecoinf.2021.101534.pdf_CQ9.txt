Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the training data for the pipeline is obtained from popular community-contributed animal sound databases such as Macaulay Library, xeno-canto, and iNaturalist. It can be assumed that the data used from these databases is stored on their respective platforms.

It is also mentioned that the SILIC framework, which is used for various reuse applications, allows for data to be exchanged with other databases or web applications through APIs. It is possible that the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is hosted on a platform that is accessible through the SILIC framework.

Additionally, the context states that the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is used for sharing and exchanging biodiversity data, but it is not specified if it is used as a data repository for the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline, it can be assumed that the training data is stored on the platforms of the databases used, such as Macaulay Library, xeno-canto, and iNaturalist. It is also possible that the data repository is hosted on a platform accessible through the SILIC framework. However, it is not specified if GBIF is used as a data repository for the pipeline.
