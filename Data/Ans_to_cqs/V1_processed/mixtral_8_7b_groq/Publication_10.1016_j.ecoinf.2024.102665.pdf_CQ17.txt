The provided context does not contain information about the regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context discusses various topics related to data analysis, marine biology, and deep learning, but it does not mention any specific regularization techniques.

Regularization methods are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data that may not generalize well to new, unseen data. Dropout is a regularization technique used in deep learning that randomly sets a fraction of the neurons in a layer to zero during training, which helps to prevent over-reliance on any single neuron and encourages the model to learn more robust features. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights, which encourages the model to learn smaller weights and avoid overfitting.

Without more information, it is not possible to answer this query definitively. However, it is common practice to use regularization techniques such as dropout and L2 regularization in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting.
