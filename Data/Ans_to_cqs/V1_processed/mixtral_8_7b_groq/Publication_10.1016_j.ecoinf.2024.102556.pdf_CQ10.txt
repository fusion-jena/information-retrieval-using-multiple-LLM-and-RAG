I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various topics related to deep learning techniques, including multiscale feature-extraction networks (MSNet), feature fusion methods (MSF), and residual structures in deep learning models. However, it does not mention or provide a link to any code repository for a deep learning pipeline.
