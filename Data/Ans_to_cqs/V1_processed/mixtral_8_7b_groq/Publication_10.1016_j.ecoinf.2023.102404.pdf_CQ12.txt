The provided context does not give information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The focus of the texts is on machine learning models, particularly decision tree-based models, and their parameters. Deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers are not mentioned.


The pieces of context given concentrate on machine learning techniques, specifically tuning and evaluating the performance of a decision tree-based model using parameters such as 'numberOfTrees', 'minLeafPopulation', 'bagFraction', and 'seed'. Deep learning models, such as CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers, are not mentioned in the context.
