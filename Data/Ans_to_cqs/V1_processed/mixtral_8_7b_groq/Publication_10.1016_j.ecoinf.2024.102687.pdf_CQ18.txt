The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, we can infer some methods that might have been used based on the information given.

Firstly, the use of the Adam optimizer with a default learning rate of 0.0001 and weight decay of 0 suggests that the model's performance was being monitored by tracking the convergence of the optimization process. The choice of the Adam optimizer, which is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm, implies that the learning rate was dynamically adjusted during training to minimize the loss function. This could have been used as a means to monitor the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

Secondly, the fine-tuning of the model on the entire dataset for 100 epochs, with each epoch consisting of 500 episodic tasks, indicates that the model's performance was being evaluated on a per-task basis. By monitoring the model's performance on individual tasks, it would have been possible to identify any issues or patterns in the model's behavior and make adjustments accordingly.

Thirdly, the calculation of energy consumption related to the training of the models using the CodeCarbon package suggests that the model's performance was being monitored from a computational efficiency perspective. By tracking the energy consumption of the model during training, it would have been possible to optimize the training process for energy efficiency and reduce the overall training time.

Lastly, the evaluation of the latent space representations extracted from the backbone of the model to improve the quality of clustering indicates that the model's performance was being monitored from a feature learning perspective. By evaluating the quality of the learned features, it would have been possible to assess the model's ability to extract meaningful representations from the input data and make adjustments to the model architecture or training process as needed.

In summary, while the specific strategy for monitoring the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context, we can infer that multiple methods were used to monitor the model's performance from different perspectives, including optimization convergence, per-task evaluation, computational efficiency, and feature learning.
