Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, there are some implicit indications that suggest certain steps may have been taken.

Firstly, the authors mention that they utilized 16 input parameters, including ecological and atmospheric variables, which were statistically resampled. This suggests that some form of data resampling or augmentation may have been employed to increase the diversity of the dataset and reduce overfitting.

Secondly, the authors evaluated the performance of their model using the Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metric across all thresholds. This comprehensive evaluation method helps to assess the model's performance in various decision-making scenarios, which could indirectly contribute to the model's generalizability.

Lastly, the authors compared their deep learning model (CNN) with the BIOCLIM model, a well-established species distribution model. By comparing their model with an existing one, they implicitly engaged in a form of external validation, which can help assess the model's generalizability.

However, it is important to note that these inferences are based on limited information, and the explicit mention of techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or using a diverse dataset is absent from the text. Therefore, while there are some indications that generalizability measures might have been taken, it is not possible to definitively answer this question without additional context.
