Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. However, I can provide a general overview of some common data annotation techniques in machine learning and computer vision, which are often used as a part of deep learning pipelines.

Data annotation techniques are essential for supervised learning tasks, where models are trained using labeled data. In the context of computer vision, annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a rectangle around the object of interest in an image. It is useful for tasks like object detection, where the goal is to identify and locate objects within an image.
2. Instance segmentation: In this technique, each instance of an object within an image is segmented and labeled. This provides a more detailed labeling than bounding box annotation, as it captures the object's shape and location precisely. Instance segmentation is often used for tasks like semantic segmentation and image recognition.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image according to the object class it belongs to. It is useful for tasks like scene understanding and image analysis.
4. Pixel-level annotation: Similar to semantic segmentation, pixel-level annotation involves labeling each pixel in an image. However, it can also include additional information, such as depth or surface normals.
5. Point-level annotation: In some cases, it might be more efficient to annotate individual points in an image instead of pixels or bounding boxes. Point-level annotation can be useful for tasks like object detection or 3D reconstruction.

These annotation techniques are often used in machine learning and computer vision pipelines, including deep learning. However, the provided context does not contain specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the mentioned studies.
