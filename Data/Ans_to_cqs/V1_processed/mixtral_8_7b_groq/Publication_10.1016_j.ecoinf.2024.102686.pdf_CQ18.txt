Based on the provided context, there is no explicit description of a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it is mentioned that the learning rate, denoted as Î·(t), decreases with time t in Equation (4). This implies that there might be a form of monitoring the model's performance, as the learning rate adjustment can be a way to prevent overfitting or to ensure the model's convergence.

Furthermore, the clustering quality index (CQI) is discussed in the context, which is an evaluation metric for clustering results. Although CQI is not directly related to monitoring the model performance during training, it can be used to assess the quality of clustering after the training process.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention a strategy for monitoring the model performance during training, the learning rate adjustment and the use of CQI for clustering evaluation can be inferred as possible approaches to ensure the model's performance and convergence.
