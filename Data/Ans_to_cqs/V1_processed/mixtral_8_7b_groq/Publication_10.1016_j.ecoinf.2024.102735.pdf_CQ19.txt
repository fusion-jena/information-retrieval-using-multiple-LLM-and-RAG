Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch that were used to build the model. The text focuses on the use of data-driven models, specifically machine learning models like random forest (RF), Multilayer perceptron (MLP), long-short term memory (LSTM), and support vector regression (SVR) for predicting algal-related parameters. It also discusses the impact of including high-frequency datasets during the model training phase and the optimization of model hyperparameters using the Optuna framework. However, it does not specify the deep learning framework used. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
