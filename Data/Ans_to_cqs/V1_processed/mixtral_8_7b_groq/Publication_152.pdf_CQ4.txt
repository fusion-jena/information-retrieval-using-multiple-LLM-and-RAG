Data augmentation techniques are used to increase the diversity of the training data by applying various transformations to the existing data. In the context of deep learning pipelines, data augmentation has been proven to be an efficient way to improve the F1 score for image classification tasks, as mentioned in the first piece of context.

One such data augmentation technique is changing the brightness and zoom of images collected by UAV flights at a constant height above ground. Small changes in brightness and zoom can help significantly improve the results, while medium or large changes in zoom range can cause degradation of results. However, changing the range in height and width can turn all vegetation too close visually and create confusion for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

The paper titled "Learning image features with fewer labels using a semi-supervised deep convolutional network" [29] does not explicitly mention any data augmentation techniques. However, it discusses using a semi-supervised deep convolutional network to learn image features with fewer labels.

The paper titled "Identification and grading of maize drought on RGB images of UAV based on improved U-Net" [23] uses an improved U-Net architecture for identifying and grading maize drought on RGB images collected by UAV. Although the paper does not explicitly mention data augmentation techniques, it is common practice to use data augmentation techniques while training deep learning models, especially when working with images.

The paper titled "Convolutional neural networks enable efficient, accurate, and fine-grained segmentation of plant species and communities from high-resolution UAV imagery" [24] uses convolutional neural networks for segmenting plant species and communities from high-resolution UAV imagery. However, the paper does not explicitly mention any data augmentation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline.

The paper titled "Accuracy of Orthomosaic Generated by Different Methods in Example of UAV Platform MUSTQ" [25] discusses the accuracy of orthomosaic generated by different methods in an example of UAV platform. However, the paper does not mention any data augmentation techniques.

The paper titled "RICAP: Random Image Cropping and Patching Data Augmentation for Deep CNNs" [26] proposes a new data augmentation technique called RICAP, which involves randomly cropping and patching multiple images to create a new image. This new image is then used as additional training data for the deep learning model.

In summary, while not all papers explicitly mention data augmentation techniques, it is a common practice to use data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling in deep learning pipelines, especially when working with images. The RICAP data augmentation technique [26] is a notable example of a data augmentation technique specifically designed for deep CNNs.
