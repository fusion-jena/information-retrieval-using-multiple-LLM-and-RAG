The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model presented in the paper are the learning rate and the optimizer. Specifically, the paper uses the Iterative Knowledge Hyperparameter Optimization (IKHO) algorithm to optimally adjust the hyperparameters of the EfficientNet model. However, the paper does not provide specific details about the learning rate or the optimizer used.

In the context of the EfficientNet model, the learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls the step size during gradient descent optimization. It determines how much the weights are updated during each iteration of the training process. A learning rate that is too high may cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, while a learning rate that is too low may result in slow convergence.

The optimizer is another hyperparameter that determines the algorithm used for optimization. In the paper, the optimizer used is not specified, but commonly used optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.

The IKHO algorithm is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the EfficientNet model. This algorithm is a Bayesian optimization method that iteratively selects the hyperparameters to evaluate based on the previous evaluations. It uses a Gaussian process to model the relationship between the hyperparameters and the validation loss.

In the context of Variational Autoencoder (VAE), the paper mentions the use of backpropagation (BP) technique for learning the entire network parameters. However, it does not provide specific details about the learning rate or the optimizer used in VAE.

Therefore, while the paper presents a new deep learning model for satellite imagery analysis in ecology management, it does not provide specific details about the learning rate or the optimizer used in the EfficientNet model or VAE.
