Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context discusses the use of Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) for identifying potential drivers of changes in herring populations, but it does not mention any data annotation techniques.

Data annotation techniques are commonly used in computer vision tasks, where they help in labeling data and preparing it for training deep learning models. However, the context provided here focuses on the use of GBRT for analyzing herring populations, and it does not mention any computer vision tasks or data annotation techniques.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer this query.
