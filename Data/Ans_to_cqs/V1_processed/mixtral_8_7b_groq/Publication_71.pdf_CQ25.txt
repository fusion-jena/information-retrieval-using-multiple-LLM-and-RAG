The deep learning model in question is DeepLabV3+, which is used for semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation is a pixel-level classification task, where the model classifies each pixel of an input image into specific categories. In this case, DeepLabV3+ is used for land cover classification, where it classifies each pixel of a satellite image into various land cover classes.

This is evident from the context provided, which mentions that DeepLabV3+ is used for training a land cover model using training datasets. The model starts with the weights of a pre-trained model, except for the logits, which are fine-tuned with further training. The logit weights are excluded because the number of land covers in the Vasiliko and Kimisala dataset is different from the number of classes in the PASCAL VOC-2012 dataset.

Additionally, the context also mentions that the DeepLabV3+ architecture is adjusted to accommodate four-channel input images, including a NIR band in addition to the RGB bands. This modification is necessary because the existing pre-trained models, which are for RGB, cannot be used directly for four-channel input images. This further supports the fact that DeepLabV3+ is used for semantic segmentation, as this task requires processing multi-channel images.

In summary, based on the provided context, DeepLabV3+ is used for semantic segmentation, specifically for land cover classification in satellite imagery.
