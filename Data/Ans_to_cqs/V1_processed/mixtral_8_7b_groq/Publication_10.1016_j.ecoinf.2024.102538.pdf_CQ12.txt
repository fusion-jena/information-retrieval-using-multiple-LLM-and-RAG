The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a positional attention mechanism. This is evident in the baseline model established for assessing the impact of hierarchical information. The Xception network, a type of CNN, was adapted with a positional attention mechanism to ensure the effectiveness of bird recognition. The Xception network was chosen due to the superiority of its deep separable convolutional (DSC) structure, which outperforms other CNN architectures like Resnet and DenseNet. The DSC structure provides significant performance improvement and quicker training and inference speeds compared to vision transformers. However, it's important to note that other models incorporating Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers have been used in related contexts. For instance, Zhang et al. (2019) incorporated an LSTM network into a 3DCNN-LSTM model for bird song classification, and Wang et al. (2024) used an improved ACGAN model based on the residual structure. Nonetheless, the model used in the provided context primarily revolves around a CNN with a positional attention mechanism.
