Based on the provided context, the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization is not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer that the authors explored different combinations of scale, shape, and compactness values to find the optimal parameters for their segmentation model.

In the context, there are several figures (Fig. 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11) and a table (Table 1) presenting the results of the segmentation for different parameter configurations. These results suggest a systematic exploration of the parameter space, possibly using a manual search or exhaustive search approach.

For instance, Table 1 lists the segmentation scales, shape, and compactness values for three levels of features (Water, Arable land, Grassland, Artificial land, and Sand; Poplar, Willow, Pine sylvestris, and Pinus tabulaeformis). This table indicates that the authors tested multiple combinations of hyperparameters for each feature category at different levels.

Furthermore, figures like Fig. 8, 10, and 11 showcase the comparison of optimal parameter segmentation effects at small, medium, and large scales, respectively. These figures illustrate the results of various hyperparameter configurations, allowing the authors to select the optimal parameters based on the presented evaluation criteria.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention grid search, random search, or any other optimization techniques, the authors' approach appears to be a systematic exploration of the parameter space, which is consistent with the objective of hyperparameter optimization.

In summary, the hyperparameters of the model in the provided context are optimized through a systematic exploration of the parameter space, possibly using a manual or exhaustive search approach. However, the specific optimization technique, such as grid search or random search, is not explicitly mentioned.
