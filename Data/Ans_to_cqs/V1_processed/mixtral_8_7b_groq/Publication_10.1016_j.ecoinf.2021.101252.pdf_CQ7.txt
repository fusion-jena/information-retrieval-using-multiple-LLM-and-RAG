In the context provided, the data is split into four sets for training deep learning models using AutoML: a candidate model training set (At), a left-out validation data set (Av), a full training data set (Bt), and a final test data set (T).

The candidate model training set (At) is used to train each candidate model generated by the AutoML procedure. The learning rate and number of layers, among other hyperparameters, are selected at random from a prespecified range of values for each candidate model. Training is done using a small subset of the data for a small number of epochs.

The left-out validation data set (Av) is used to compare the performance of the candidate models. After training, each candidate model's performance is evaluated using this validation data set. The selected candidate model is usually the best performing among the candidates.

The full training data set (Bt) is used to train the selected candidate model. An optimal number of training epochs is identified for this step to avoid under- or overfitting of the model. The 'optimal' number of training epochs is determined by monitoring the model's validation performance using a holdout data partition (Bv). The number of training epochs that provides the best validation performance is considered 'optimal'.

Finally, the performance of the model having an 'optimal' number of training epochs is evaluated using a 'final' test data set (T). This provides the best estimate of the predictive performance of the model.

In summary, the data is split into four sets for deep learning model training using AutoML: a candidate model training set (At), a left-out validation data set (Av), a full training data set (Bt), and a final test data set (T). The left-out validation data set (Av) and holdout data partition (Bv) are used to compare and select the best candidate model and identify an 'optimal' number of training epochs, respectively. The final test data set (T) is used to evaluate the performance of the model having an 'optimal' number of training epochs.
