The provided context does not give information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other method for hyperparameter tuning. The context focuses on the analysis of biodiversity patterns using Species Richness Indices (SRI) and the evaluation of these patterns based on different grid sizes and fishery areas. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
