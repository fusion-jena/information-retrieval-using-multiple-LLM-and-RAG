Although the provided context does not directly mention dropout or L2 regularization, it does discuss the use of Batch Normalization (BN) as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.

Batch Normalization is a technique where the parameters of the BN layer are merged into a convolution layer to improve the forward inference speed of the model. This method can help prevent overfitting by accelerating network convergence, solving gradient disappearance and explosion problems, and optimizing model performance. BN technology is commonly used in advanced network models such as ResNet, MobileNet, Xception, and ShuffleNet.

However, it's important to note that while BN layers play an active role in the training process, they can add additional operations to the network forward inference, which can affect the performance of the model and occupy more memory or memory space.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention dropout or L2 regularization, it does discuss the use of Batch Normalization as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
