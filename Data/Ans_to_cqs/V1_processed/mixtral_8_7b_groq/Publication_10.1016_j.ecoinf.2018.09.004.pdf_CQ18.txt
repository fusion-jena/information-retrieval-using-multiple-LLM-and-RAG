The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of stratified cross-validation and evaluation with Precision, Recall, and F-measure. Stratified cross-validation is a technique used to divide the dataset into training and testing sets while preserving the original percentage of samples for each class. This method helps to ensure that each fold is a good representative of the whole dataset.

The performance of the models is then evaluated using Precision, Recall, and F-measure. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. It measures the relevancy of the obtained results. Recall, on the other hand, is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class. It measures how many truly relevant instances were identified. The F-measure is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall and provides a single metric that encapsulates both Precision and Recall.

This strategy is preferred over using a fixed, predefined partitioning of the dataset, as the latter may not provide an accurate representation of the model's performance due to the accidental characteristics of the specific partitioning. For instance, if the test set happens to include points that are easy to categorize, the model may yield good performance, but this may not be indicative of its overall performance.

Moreover, the dataset used in this study is not balanced, with the Cymodocea class constituting 75% of the dataset. Therefore, using Accuracy as a performance measure may not be suitable, as predicting all test examples as Cymodocea would result in a high Accuracy score, even if the model is not correctly identifying other classes. Instead, the models are ranked based on the F-measure, which provides a more comprehensive measure of the model's performance.

In summary, the strategy for monitoring model performance during training involves the use of stratified cross-validation and evaluation with Precision, Recall, and F-measure. This method provides a more accurate representation of the model's performance than using a fixed, predefined partitioning of the dataset and is particularly useful when working with imbalanced datasets.
