Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific deep learning model used or its hyperparameters such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses a model called FERM (Forest Ecosystem Restoration Model) and its parameters, but FERM does not appear to be a deep learning model.

The FERM model has several parameters, such as S0, S1, Steepness0, Steepness1, Cw, Cb, D0,min, D0,max, Drowning switch, Drowned threshold, Critical interval, and others. However, these parameters are related to the model's ecological and environmental characteristics rather than deep learning hyperparameters.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
