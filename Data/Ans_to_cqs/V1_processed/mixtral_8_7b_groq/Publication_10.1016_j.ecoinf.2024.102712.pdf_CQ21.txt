Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of specific postprocessing steps, such as saliency map generation or confusion matrix calculation, that were carried out after model training. However, the text does mention the validation of the model using a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach. This involves training the model multiple times, leaving out one observation at a time for validation, and calculating metrics like root mean square error (RMSE), R-squared (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and bias.

The text also discusses the evaluation of the residuals, which can help assess the model's goodness-of-fit. Inspection of residual plots is a common practice to check for patterns, heteroscedasticity, or outliers that might indicate issues with the model assumptions or data.

In summary, the postprocessing steps mentioned in the provided context include:

1. Model validation using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) approach
2. Calculation of metrics such as RMSE, R2, MAE, and bias
3. Inspection of residual plots for model evaluation
