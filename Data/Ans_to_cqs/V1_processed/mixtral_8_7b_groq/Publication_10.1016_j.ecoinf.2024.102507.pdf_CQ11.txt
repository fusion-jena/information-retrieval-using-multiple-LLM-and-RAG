Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text describes a study involving the use of deep learning models for ecological informatics, including spectral segmentation and band selection. However, it does not provide information about where the data used in the study is hosted.

The study mentions the number of bands used in the deep learning models and the band numbers selected after spectral segmentation and band selection (SSDM). The results of the study are presented in figures and tables, but there is no link to a data repository provided.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it is not addressed in the given context.
