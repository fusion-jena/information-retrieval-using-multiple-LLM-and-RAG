The specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are not mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that model hyperparameters were tuned for each species-specific model using Bayesian optimization focused on reducing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions based on environmental cross-validation with ten folds. This suggests that RMSE, a measure of the differences between values predicted by a model and the values actually observed, was used to evaluate the performance of the model. However, it does not provide information about other metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall. Therefore, based on the given context, it can be said that RMSE is used to evaluate the performance of the model, but it is not possible to confirm if other metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall were also used.
