The provided pieces of context do not contain information about the deep learning model or the platform used to deploy it, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. The context mainly discusses a study related to Ecological Informatics and presents figures showing hydrographs for three events from a model output. The events are simulated for different scenarios, including S-2016, Observed, S-Up, S-Down, and S-Total. However, there is no mention of the deep learning model or the platform used for its deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
