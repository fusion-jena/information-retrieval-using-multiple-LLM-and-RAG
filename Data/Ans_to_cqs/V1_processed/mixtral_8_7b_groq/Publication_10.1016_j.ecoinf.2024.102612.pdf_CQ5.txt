The provided context does not explicitly mention the names or types of datasets used in the deep learning (DL) pipeline for semantic classification of LiDAR point clouds. However, it does mention that the models were trained using synthetic data generated by an external simulator. The simulator primarily focuses on two perspectives: aerial and terrestrial, specifically ALS, Terrestrial, and Mobile Laser Scanning (TLS and MLS, respectively) point clouds.

Moreover, the models were further fine-tuned and validated using real LiDAR point clouds, referred to as the ground truth data, collected in Section 2.3. The ground truth data was segmented and used to validate the classification results of the DL model trained with synthetic data.

Therefore, while specific dataset names like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet are not mentioned, the context suggests that the pipeline involves two types of datasets:

1. Synthetic LiDAR point cloud data generated by an external simulator.
2. Real LiDAR point cloud data, referred to as the ground truth data, collected in Section 2.3.
