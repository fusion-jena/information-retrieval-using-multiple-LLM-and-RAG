The provided context discusses the use of machine learning and deep learning models for predicting forest fire susceptibility, but it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. However, based on common practices in data preprocessing for deep learning, we can infer some possible steps that might have been involved.

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the data for model training. It involves several techniques to clean, transform, and normalize the data so that the model can learn effectively from it.

1. Data Cleaning: This step involves removing any irrelevant, missing, or inconsistent data from the dataset. For instance, in the context of forest fire prediction, any records with missing or inconsistent values for the features related to forest fire susceptibility might be removed.

2. Data Transformation: This step involves converting the data into a format that is suitable for the deep learning model. For instance, categorical variables might be converted into numerical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding. Additionally, the data might be aggregated or disaggregated to a suitable time interval or spatial resolution.

3. Data Normalization: This step involves scaling the data to a similar range to avoid any features dominating the learning process. Common techniques for normalization include min-max scaling, z-score normalization, and decimal scaling. While the context does not explicitly mention normalization, it does mention using the AUC-weighted ensemble method, which suggests that the models' performance was compared using a common metric, possibly the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. AUC is a metric that is not sensitive to the scale of the data, so some form of normalization might have been used.

4. Data Splitting: This step involves dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance. While the context does not explicitly mention data splitting, it does mention using a 10-fold cross-validation design, which is a technique for evaluating the model's performance by splitting the data into training and validation sets and averaging the results over multiple runs.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model, it is likely that the data was cleaned, transformed, and normalized before training. Additionally, the data was split into training, validation, and testing sets using a 10-fold cross-validation design.
