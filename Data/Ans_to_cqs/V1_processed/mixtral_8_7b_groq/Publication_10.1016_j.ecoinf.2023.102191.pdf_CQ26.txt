The provided context discusses techniques used to address data bias in the context of citizen science data collection for marine species, particularly in relation to a mobile app used for post-dive debriefing with divers. While the query asks about techniques used during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, the context does provide some relevant information about how data bias is addressed in this specific data collection process.

To address data bias in this context, the following techniques are used:

1. Including a checklist of conspicuous species: This technique is used to ensure that divers report all species observed during a dive, rather than only reporting rare or charismatic species. By providing a specific checklist, divers are prompted to report all species they observed, which can help to reduce bias in the data.
2. Relying on the dive guide to conduct the interview: The dive guide or staff member who conducts the post-dive interview is often knowledgeable and experienced in local fauna and flora. By relying on their expertise, there is some level of validation of the species sighted and reported, which can help to reduce misidentification of less known species.
3. Compiling responses and open-ended queries: To gain insight into the best way the monitoring program can bring value to the dive community, responses and open-ended queries are compiled and used to calculate the average SUS score. This technique can help to ensure that the data collected is relevant and valuable to the community, which can increase participation and data quality.

While these techniques are not specifically related to preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, they do address data bias in the data collection process. By using a checklist, relying on expert validation, and ensuring the relevance and value of the data collected, these techniques can help to reduce bias in the data and improve data quality.

It's worth noting that in the context of deep learning, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling can be used during preprocessing to address data bias. Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subsets based on specific criteria, such as class labels, to ensure that each subset is representative of the overall population. Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances of a specific class in the data, while undersampling involves decreasing the number of instances of a specific class. Diverse data collection involves collecting data from a wide range of sources and contexts to ensure that the data is representative of the overall population.

In summary, while the provided context does not specifically discuss techniques used during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline to address data bias, it does provide relevant information about how data bias is addressed in this specific data collection process. Techniques such as using a checklist, relying on expert validation, and ensuring the relevance and value of the data collected can help to reduce bias in the data and improve data quality. Additionally, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling can be used during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline to address data bias.
