Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to ensure the data is in a suitable format for the model to learn effectively. These steps include normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

Normalization is the process of rescaling numeric data values to a common range, often between 0 and 1. This is important because deep learning models are sensitive to the scale of the input features. If some features have significantly larger or smaller values than others, the model may give undue importance to those features during training. Normalization ensures that all features are on a similar scale, allowing the model to learn more effectively.

Scaling is similar to normalization but involves rescaling data to a specific range, often the standard deviation from the mean. This is useful when dealing with data that has a known distribution or variance. Scaling helps to maintain the distribution of the data while reshaping it to a more manageable range.

Cleaning is the process of identifying and handling missing or invalid data points. Deep learning models are not robust to missing data, so it's essential to address this issue before training. Cleaning can involve imputation, where missing values are estimated based on other data points, or removal of data points with missing values. Additionally, cleaning can involve handling outlier data points that may skew the model's learning.

In summary, before training a deep learning model, it's essential to perform preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning. These steps help ensure that the data is in a suitable format for the model to learn effectively and prevent issues that may arise from improperly formatted data. Normalization and scaling help to reshape the data to a common range or distribution, while cleaning identifies and handles missing or invalid data points that may negatively impact the model's learning.
