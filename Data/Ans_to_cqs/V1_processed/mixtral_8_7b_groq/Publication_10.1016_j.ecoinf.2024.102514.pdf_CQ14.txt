The hyperparameters of the model in the study are optimized using a grid search methodology. Grid search is a hyperparameter tuning technique that involves an exhaustive search through a manually specified subset of the hyperparameter space of a learning algorithm. It evaluates the performance of the model for each combination of hyperparameters in the specified subset. By doing so, it seeks to find the combination of hyperparameters that yield the best performance of the model.

Grid search is a popular approach for hyperparameter tuning, as it allows for a systematic and thorough exploration of the hyperparameter space. It has been employed in many studies to optimize the hyperparameters of various models. The study states that many studies have employed the grid search approach to optimize the hyperparameters of the model, as this technique assesses the model's performance for each grid cell.

The process of hyperparameter tuning using grid search involves specifying a range of values for each hyperparameter and creating a grid of all possible combinations of these values. The model is then trained and evaluated for each combination of hyperparameters in the grid. The combination of hyperparameters that results in the best performance of the model is selected as the optimal set of hyperparameters.

In the study, the grid search approach was used to obtain the optimal values of various hyperparameters in order to improve the model's performance. The specific hyperparameters that were tuned and the ranges of values used for each hyperparameter are not specified in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the performance of the models was evaluated based on various statistical measures, including the coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), model efficiency factor (MEF), and root mean square error (RMSE). These measures were used to rank the models and identify the best algorithm based on prediction errors.

In summary, the hyperparameters of the model in the study are optimized using a grid search methodology, which involves an exhaustive search through a manually specified subset of the hyperparameter space of a learning algorithm. This technique assesses the model's performance for each combination of hyperparameters in the specified subset and seeks to find the combination of hyperparameters that yield the best performance of the model.
