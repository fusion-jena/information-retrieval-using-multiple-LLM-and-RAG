The provided context does not contain information about the optimization techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on a study comparing different methods for correcting sampling bias in species distribution modeling. It discusses the performance of various correction methods, such as Fenv, BGenv, BGgeo, and Fgeo, based on different evaluation indices like ΔDenv, ΔDgeo, and ΔAUC. However, it does not mention any optimization techniques used in deep learning, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
