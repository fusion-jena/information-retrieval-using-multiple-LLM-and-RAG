The text provided discusses the training and evaluation of a deep learning model for point cloud data segmentation, but it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the model. However, based on the information given, we can infer that the following measures were taken:

1. Diverse dataset: The model was trained on point cloud data representing trees and poles, suggesting that the dataset contained diverse geometric features.
2. Hold-out method: The original data was preprocessed using the hold-out method, which involves dividing the data into a training set and a test set at a ratio of 3:7. This method helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and can generalize well to new, unseen data.
3. Parameter tuning: The authors adjusted various parameters such as voxel size, regularization strength, and batch size to explore their influence on the experimental results. This process helps to ensure that the model is robust and can perform well under different conditions.

However, it is important to note that the text does not mention the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are other common techniques used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on one fold, and testing it on the remaining folds. This process is repeated for each fold, providing a more robust estimate of the model's performance. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset in a way that ensures that each subset contains a similar distribution of classes, which can be useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

Therefore, while the text suggests that some measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, it does not provide enough information to definitively conclude that cross-validation or stratified splitting were used.
