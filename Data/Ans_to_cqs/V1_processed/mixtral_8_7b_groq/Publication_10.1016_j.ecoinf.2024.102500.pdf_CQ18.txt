The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using cross-validation resampling and hyperparameter tuning. The dataset is divided into five equal-sized folds, and five times, one of each fold is used for training and assessment. This process helps in validating the training and assessment process and improving the model performance and hyperparameter tuning efficiency estimation.

The Python libraryâ€™s randint and uniform commands are used to pick integers and discrete or continuous values within a range for hyperparameters like n_estimators, max_depth, and min_samples_split. Hyperparameter tuning plays a crucial role in optimizing the performance of a model by controlling overfitting or underfitting issues.

To evaluate the models, R2 values, which indicate how well the models captured data variation, and RMSE values, which assess residual dispersion and model prediction performance, are used. The Lazy Predict method, R2 score-based model selection, is used to identify suitable ML models from lazy predict results, and each ML model is then hyper-tuned to build robust models for SWQPs, maintaining consistent input and output parameters and the train-test percentage.

The revised algorithms help in identifying data patterns and improving prediction. A meta model is developed that combines the predictions from the best-performing models across all parameters. This approach allows for a more efficient and streamlined process, reducing the complexity and time required for water quality prediction.

Therefore, the strategy to monitor the model performance during training involves using cross-validation resampling, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation using R2 and RMSE values. The Lazy Predict method is used to identify suitable ML models, which are then hyper-tuned to build robust models. Finally, a meta model is developed that combines the predictions from the best-performing models across all parameters.
