The provided context discusses the development and evaluation of a deep learning pipeline for bioacoustic monitoring but does not mention the data repository where the training data is available. The pipeline involves creating a training dataset using template-based detections and a graphical user interface, reducing the need for manual effort. The model is then trained using a custom training loss and multi-label learning from single-label training data.

However, the context does not specify the data repository where the training dataset is available for access. It is possible that the dataset may not be publicly available due to privacy concerns or other restrictions. In such cases, the dataset may only be available upon request to the authors or the institution conducting the study.

Therefore, I would recommend contacting the authors or the institution directly to inquire about the availability and accessibility of the training dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, it may be helpful to check the publication associated with the study, as the data repository may be mentioned in the article or in the supplementary materials.
