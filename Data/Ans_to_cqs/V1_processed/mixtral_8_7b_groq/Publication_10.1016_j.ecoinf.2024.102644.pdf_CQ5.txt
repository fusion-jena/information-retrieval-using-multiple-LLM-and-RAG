The text provided does not give information about specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Instead, it describes a study that uses species observation data and proxy environmental conditions for the Massaciuccoli Lake basin in Tuscany, Italy.

The species observation data comes from a public authoritative repository of big data (GBIF) and is improved with reliable records that were accurately and directly observed in the field. After applying a data pre-processing algorithm, the authors obtained 17 datasets, including one each for elevation (ET), water surface (WS), canopy (C), and seven each for temperature (T) and precipitation (P). These datasets were used as proxy environmental conditions for annual environmental snapshots in the years 1950, 1999, 2016, 2050, and 2100 under the RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios.

Therefore, while the study uses big data and artificial intelligence models, it does not use any of the standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
