The context does not provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, which in this case is a pre-trained convolutional neural network called AlexNet (AN). However, it is mentioned that the deep learning model was implemented in MATLAB. MATLAB supports both CPUs and GPUs for computation, and it allows users to accelerate computations by using GPU hardware. Therefore, it is possible that the deep learning model was trained using a GPU, but the context does not confirm this.

Moreover, training large deep learning models typically requires significant computational resources, and it is common to use specialized hardware such as GPUs or TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) to accelerate the training process. Therefore, it is likely that some form of specialized hardware was used to train the deep learning model, but the context does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion.

In summary, while the context suggests that MATLAB was used to implement the deep learning model and MATLAB supports GPU acceleration, it does not provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.
