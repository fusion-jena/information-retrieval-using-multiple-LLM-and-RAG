The provided context does not contain information about the specific deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) used to build the model. The context focuses on the challenges and solutions related to the construction of Species Distribution Models (SDMs) using presence sites data.

The text mentions the use of "correction methods" and a "parameterization" that achieves a good compromise, but it does not specify any deep learning frameworks or tools. The reference to the Wisz et al. (2008) paper provides further information on the effects of sample size on the performance of species distribution models, but it does not discuss deep learning frameworks either.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine which deep learning frameworks were used to build the model.
