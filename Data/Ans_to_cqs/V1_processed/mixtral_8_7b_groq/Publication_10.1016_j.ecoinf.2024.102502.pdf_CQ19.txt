The provided context does not directly mention which frameworks are used to build a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the GEE (Google Earth Engine) platform is used for processing and analyzing environmental data. GEE is a cloud-based platform that provides a large catalog of geospatial data and computational resources for data processing and analysis. It supports JavaScript and Python for coding, but it does not directly support deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

To build a deep learning model using GEE data, one would typically need to export the data from GEE and then use a local machine or cloud-based infrastructure to train the model using a deep learning framework. For instance, one could use Python scripts within GEE to preprocess and extract features from the data, and then export the data to a cloud-based platform like Google Colab or AWS SageMaker to train a deep learning model using TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Therefore, while GEE is a powerful platform for processing and analyzing environmental data, it is not a direct solution for building deep learning models. Instead, it can be used as a tool to preprocess and extract features from the data, which can then be used as inputs for deep learning models built using other frameworks.
