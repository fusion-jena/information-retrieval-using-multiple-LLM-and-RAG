The text describes the use of oversampling and data augmentation techniques to address data bias in a deep learning pipeline. Oversampling is used to increase the number of instances of the minority class in the training dataset. In this case, the minority class is the sociable weavers, which has a ratio of 1:100 compared to the majority class, the great tits. Specifically, for the sociable weavers, 10 individuals with more than 350 pictures were used for training, while for the great tits, 67 individuals with less than 350 pictures were used. However, to avoid overfitting caused by having very similar pictures, oversampling was restricted to the training dataset and not applied to the validation dataset.

Additionally, a data augmentation procedure was used to increase the sample size by applying transformations to an existing set of images. This procedure involved using images from different days in the training and validation datasets, resulting in a dataset of sociable weavers containing 27,038 unique images.

The text does not explicitly mention stratified splitting or diverse data collection techniques. However, it is mentioned that photographs of the animals were taken across different times of the day and in different lighting conditions to capture a broad range of contexts required for the CNN to work effectively across contexts.

In summary, the techniques used to address data bias in the deep learning pipeline described in the text include oversampling and data augmentation. Oversampling was used to increase the number of instances of the minority class in the training dataset, while data augmentation was used to artificially increase the sample size by applying transformations to an existing set of images. The text also implies the use of diverse data collection techniques by photographing the animals across different times of the day and in different lighting conditions.
