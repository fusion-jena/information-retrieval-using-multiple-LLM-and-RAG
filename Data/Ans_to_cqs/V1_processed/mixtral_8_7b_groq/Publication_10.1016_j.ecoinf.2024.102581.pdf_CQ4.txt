The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for plant image classification include random rotation, random cropping, random flipping, random color jittering, and random noise addition. These techniques were implemented using Keras' flow\_from\_directory method during the learning phase of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Data augmentation was used to generate all possible cases and ensure that the model is trained on a diverse range of data, thus improving its ability to generalize and perform accurately in real-world scenarios.

Random rotation involves rotating the image by a random angle, which helps the model to recognize the object of interest regardless of its orientation in the image. Random cropping involves selecting a random portion of the image, which helps the model to focus on different parts of the image and prevent overfitting. Random flipping involves flipping the image horizontally or vertically, which helps the model to recognize the object of interest even if it appears in a mirrored form. Random color jittering involves randomly changing the brightness, contrast, and saturation of the image, which helps the model to recognize the object of interest even if it appears in different lighting conditions. Random noise addition involves adding random noise to the image, which helps the model to recognize the object of interest even if it appears with some level of noise.

These data augmentation techniques increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, which helps the model to learn robust features and improve its performance. The search space of CNN hyperparameters was explored to find the near-optimal CNN, and the termination criterion was set as the maximum number of iterations. The overall complexity of the approach is approximated as O(TC\*NP), where TC is the total number of iterations and NP is the population size within each iteration.
