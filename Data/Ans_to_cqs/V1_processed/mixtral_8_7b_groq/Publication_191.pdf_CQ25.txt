The purpose of the deep learning model in the given context is not explicitly stated; however, based on the provided information, it can be inferred that the model is used for plant species identification, likely through a classification process.

The text discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for learning leaf features to identify plant species. It is mentioned that the optimization capability of these networks can be improved by going deeper, with examples of networks having 5, 16, 21, and even 164 convolutional layers. The comparison of these networks with the AlexNet model suggests that the model's depth plays a significant role in achieving better optimization for plant data.

Furthermore, various feature extraction techniques and classifiers are applied to the features learned by the CNNs. These include methods like LeafSnap, HCF, HCF-ScaleRobust, and SIFT, along with classifiers such as Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM) with linear and RBF kernels, and Nearest Neighbor (NN). These techniques are used to compare the performance of the CNN models.

Based on this information, it can be concluded that the deep learning model in question is primarily used for plant species identification through feature learning and classification. However, the specific model architecture or implementation details are not provided in the context.
