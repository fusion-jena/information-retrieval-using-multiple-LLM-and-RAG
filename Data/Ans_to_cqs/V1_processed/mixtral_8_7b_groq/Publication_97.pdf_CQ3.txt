In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the task of forest damage identification. However, it is mentioned that the problem is approached as a semantic segmentation task, which is a pixel-wise classification problem. This implies that some form of pixel-level annotation is used during the training data preparation.

Semantic segmentation often involves pixel-level annotation, where each pixel in the image is assigned a class label. This is different from bounding box annotation, where a bounding box is drawn around an object of interest, or instance segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and assigned a unique identifier.

In the context of remote sensing and forest damage identification, pixel-level annotation can be a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. However, it provides precise location information about the forest damage, which can be useful for further analysis and decision-making processes.

In the provided context, it is mentioned that training data were generated as batches of size (m, 256, 256, 3), where m is the batch size. The batches consisted of sub-images of size 256 Ã— 256 that were randomly cropped out from the original satellite images. Corresponding batches of mask data had shape (20, 256, 256, 1). This suggests that some form of masking or binary segmentation is used during the data preparation, where each pixel in the sub-image is assigned a binary label indicating the presence or absence of forest damage.

In summary, while the specific data annotation techniques are not mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that some form of pixel-level annotation, such as binary segmentation or masking, is used for the task of forest damage identification.
