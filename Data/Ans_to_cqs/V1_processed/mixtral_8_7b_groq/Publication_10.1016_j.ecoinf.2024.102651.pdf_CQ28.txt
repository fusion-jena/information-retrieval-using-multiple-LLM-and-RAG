Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information that specifies the platform used to deploy the deep learning model for automating UAV image analysis in wildlife monitoring. The text focuses on discussing the use of a CA-Hybrid network for Cervidae classification and the application of deep learning techniques for object detection in wildlife monitoring. It does not mention any specific cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query with the information given.
