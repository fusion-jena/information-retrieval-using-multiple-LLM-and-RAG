Based on the provided context, the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline for bat call detection and classification is audio. 

In the study by Paumen et al. (2021), the authors developed a method for bat call detection and classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The dataset used in this study consisted of audio recordings of bat calls, which were preprocessed and converted into spectrogram images as input to the CNN model. Therefore, the original data format of the recordings was audio, which was transformed into a spectrogram image format for the deep learning pipeline.

It is also worth noting that other studies in the field of bat echolocation have used similar data formats. For example, Pye (2020) provided a retrospective of echolocation signals of bats, which included analyzing and visualizing audio recordings of bat calls. Additionally, machine learning approaches for species identification based on bat calls have used audio recordings as input data (Jennings et al., 2008; Parsons and Jones, 2000; Zamora-Gutierrez et al., 2016).

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention other data formats such as image, video, or CSV, it is clear that the deep learning pipeline for bat call detection and classification uses audio recordings as input data.
