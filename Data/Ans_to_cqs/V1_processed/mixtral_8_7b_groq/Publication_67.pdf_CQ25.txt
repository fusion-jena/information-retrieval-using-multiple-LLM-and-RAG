The deep learning model in question is used for the classification of tree cover levels in high-resolution satellite and aerial images. This is evident in the training phase, where five CNN models are built based on Inception v.3 using transfer learning and data augmentation techniques. These models are then used to classify new images of drylands with different tree cover levels. The performance of the model is assessed in the validation phase, which involves evaluating the classification of the new images.

The study uses various deep learning architectures such as AlexNet, DenseNet, GoogLeNet, Inception, MobileNet, Resnet, Resnext, VGG, and Xception, with a specific focus on Inception v.3. The choice of Inception v.3 for the primary model suggests that it was selected for its proven performance in image classification tasks.

The purpose of the study is to improve the performance of CNN-based models in classifying tree cover levels. This is achieved by increasing the size of the dataset using data augmentation techniques, which have been shown to improve the performance of CNN-based models. The study also explores the use of continuous and discrete sampling design strategies, which are illustrated in Figure S2 of the supplementary materials.

The datasets used in this study are built from a global database of very high-resolution satellite and aerial RGB images from two sources. These datasets are designed to include examples of images with different levels of tree cover, continuous and discrete approximations, and the auxiliary class "Non-Forest". The metadata of these datasets is provided in the supplementary materials, Archive S2.

In summary, the deep learning model in this study is used for the classification of tree cover levels in high-resolution satellite and aerial images. The study uses various deep learning architectures, with a specific focus on Inception v.3, and employs data augmentation techniques to improve the performance of the model. The model is trained and validated using datasets designed to include various levels of tree cover and sampling design strategies.
