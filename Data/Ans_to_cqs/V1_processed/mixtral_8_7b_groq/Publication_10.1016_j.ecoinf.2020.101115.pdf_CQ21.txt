Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context focuses on the data model and vocabularies used for fish scale and otolith archive, as well as the FAIR data principles.

However, in the context of data analysis and model building, postprocessing steps like Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, and Confusion matrix can be common practices to evaluate and interpret the performance of a machine learning or image analysis model.

Saliency maps are used to highlight the important features in the input data that contribute to the model's predictions. Metrics calculation involves computing various performance measures, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess the model's quality. A Confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model, showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

In the given context, the focus is on the data model and the external vocabulary servers used for various parameters in the data model. The data model (Figure 2) shows the structure and organization of the fish scale and otolith archive, while the external vocabulary servers (Table 1) provide standardized terms and definitions for various parameters in the data model.

Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer related to the postprocessing steps involved after the model training based on the given context.
