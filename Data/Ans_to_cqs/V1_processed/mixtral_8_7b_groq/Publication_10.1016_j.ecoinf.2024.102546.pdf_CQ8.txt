Based on the provided context, there is no clear mention of a specific code repository for a deep learning pipeline related to weed detection. However, there are a few related resources that might be worth looking into.

1. DeepWeeds: A Multiclass Weed Species Image Dataset for Deep Learning
The authors of this paper created a dataset of weed images for deep learning applications. While they do not provide a complete deep learning pipeline, they do provide the dataset and some baseline models. The code and dataset are available on GitHub at <https://github.com/alexolsen/DeepWeeds>.
2. Weed25: A Deep Learning Dataset for Weed Identification
This paper presents a dataset of weed images for deep learning-based weed identification. The dataset is available on GitHub at <https://github.com/PeiWang921/Weed25>. However, there is no mention of a complete deep learning pipeline.
3. Domain Randomization for Transferring Deep Neural Networks from Simulation to the Real World
Although not directly related to weed detection, this paper by Pieter Abbeel presents a technique for transferring deep neural networks from simulation to the real world. The author has not shared any code repository for this paper.
4. Imagen Editor and Editbench: Advancing and Evaluating Text-Guided Image Inpainting
This paper introduces a text-guided image inpainting system, which might be useful for removing weeds from images. The code is available on GitHub at <https://github.com/google-research/imagen-editbench>.
5. Towards Domain Generalization in Crop and Weed Segmentation for Precision Farming Robots
This paper discusses domain generalization in crop and weed segmentation for precision farming robots. While they do not provide a complete deep learning pipeline, they do provide some code snippets and the dataset. The code and dataset are available on GitHub at <https://github.com/jweyler/towards-domain-generalization-crop-weed-segmentation>.

It is possible that the deep learning pipeline code for weed detection is not publicly available or was not mentioned in the provided context.
