The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that deep learning algorithms were considered for developing water quality prediction models, but the limited number of samples was not conducive to deep learning. It also mentions that hyperspectral data have great potential for water quality prediction. Hyperspectral data typically come in the form of image data, where each pixel contains a spectrum of reflectance measurements.

Furthermore, the context describes the use of machine learning models such as Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), and CatBoost for water quality prediction. These models typically use tabular data in the form of CSV files, where each row represents a sample and each column represents a feature.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that both image and tabular data formats are used in the machine learning and deep learning pipelines for water quality prediction. However, specific details about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not provided.
