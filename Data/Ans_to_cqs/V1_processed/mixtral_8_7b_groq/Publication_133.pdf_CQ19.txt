The specific deep learning frameworks used to build the model are not mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model is a deep learning model and the training process involves generating predictions of the training set samples, evaluating them by the loss function, and modifying their parameters according to the loss function’s gradient. This is a common process in deep learning model training. The models are trained for 30 epochs, and validation data is used to monitor the training and limit overfitting.

Additionally, it is mentioned that the model rarely confused between the three focal species, but it made some false positive predictions, particularly for the class “Psyllaephagus” and most of the missed predictions were false negatives. This suggests that the model is a multi-class classification model and it is evaluated based on recall and precision metrics.

In summary, while the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the model are not specified in the provided context, it is clear that the model is a deep learning model, trained using standard deep learning techniques, and evaluated using recall and precision metrics.
