The deep learning pipeline can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files, among others. The choice of data format depends on the specific application and the type of information being processed.

In computer vision tasks, deep learning models often use image data formats such as JPEG, PNG, or BMP. These formats store pixel intensity values that the model can use to learn features and make predictions. For instance, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used for image classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006).

In natural language processing and speech recognition, deep learning models process audio data formats like WAV or MP3. These formats store sound waves that the model can convert into spectrograms or other representations for further processing. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are commonly used for speech recognition, machine translation, and text generation tasks (Zhang and Benveniste, 1992).

Video data formats, such as MP4 or AVI, can also be used in deep learning pipelines. Video data consists of a sequence of images, which can be processed using 3D CNNs or spatiotemporal RNNs to learn features and make predictions. These models are useful for action recognition, object tracking, and video summarization tasks (Haberl et al., 2001).

Structured data, such as CSV files, can also be used in deep learning pipelines. These files store tabular data with rows and columns, which can be processed using feedforward neural networks, RNNs, or other architectures. For example, deep learning models can be used for regression, classification, or time series forecasting tasks (Xu, 1997).

In summary, deep learning models can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific application and the type of information being processed. Regardless of the data format, deep learning algorithms can learn features and make predictions by training on large-scale data (Gonzalez-Vallejo et al., 2015).
