The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). These metrics were transformed and normalized following the standard Earthnet2021 evaluation methodology. MAD, OLS, EMD, and SSIM are score metrics that should be maximized, and the ENS score, which is a harmonic mean of the four score components, should also be maximized. EMD and OLS are computed based on the observed and predicted Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), while MAD and SSIM are computed on all RGBI bands. NDVI is defined based on reflectance in the red and near-infrared bands and is computed as NDVI = (IR - Red) / (IR + Red).

Accuracy, precision, and recall are not explicitly mentioned as evaluation metrics for the deep learning model in the provided context. However, the use of MAD, OLS, EMD, and SSIM as metrics implies that the evaluation focuses on the model's ability to minimize the difference between predicted and observed NDVI and RGBI values, as well as the similarity between predicted and observed images. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, considering both the numerical differences and the structural similarity between predicted and observed data.
