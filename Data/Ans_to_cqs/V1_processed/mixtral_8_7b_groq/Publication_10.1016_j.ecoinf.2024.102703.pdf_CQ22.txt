The performance of the deep learning model in this study is evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE). 

The coefficient of determination, often denoted as R-squared, is a statistical metric that indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (Trophic State Index or TSI) that can be explained by the independent variables (aCDOM(254) and Fn(355)). It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit. In this study, the R2 values for the two models are 0.76 for aCDOM(254) and 0.71 for Fn(355), indicating a good fit.

The root-mean-square error (RMSE) is another statistical metric used to evaluate the performance of the model. It measures the difference between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable. A lower RMSE indicates a better fit. The RMSE is calculated using equation (6), which takes the square root of the average of the squared differences between the measured and predicted TSI values.

However, the query asks about metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. These metrics are commonly used in classification problems, where the goal is to predict the class or category of a given data point. In this study, the goal is to predict a continuous variable (TSI), so these metrics are not directly applicable. 

In summary, the performance of the deep learning model in this study is evaluated using the R2 and RMSE metrics, which are appropriate for predicting continuous variables.
