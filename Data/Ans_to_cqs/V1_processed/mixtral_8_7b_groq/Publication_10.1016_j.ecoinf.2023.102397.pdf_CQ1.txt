Based on the provided context, the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer that the raw data consists of bird acoustic recordings, which are likely collected using specialized audio recording devices or sensors.

In the study by Bicudo et al. (2023), they focus on the poor performance of acoustic indices as proxies for bird diversity in a fragmented Amazonian landscape. This implies that the raw data for their study includes acoustic recordings of bird sounds from that region. Similarly, the study by Brown et al. (2019) discusses automatic rain and cicada chorus filtering of bird acoustic data, indicating that their raw data also consists of bird sound recordings.

In addition, the study by Brumm (2006) investigates signalling through acoustic windows in nightingales, further supporting the idea that bird acoustic data is the raw data used in these studies. However, the specific methods for collecting these recordings, such as whether they were obtained through surveys, sensors, or public datasets, are not discussed in the provided context.
