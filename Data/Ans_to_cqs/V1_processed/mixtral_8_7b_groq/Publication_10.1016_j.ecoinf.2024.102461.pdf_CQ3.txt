The provided context discusses the creation of fire risk maps using Jenks' natural break classification method and remote sensing data, including Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images with multispectral bands. However, it does not mention any specific deep learning data annotation techniques.

In general, there are several data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for various applications, including:

1. Image-level classification: This is the simplest form of annotation, where an image is assigned to a specific class. For example, in the context of fire risk maps, an image could be classified as 'low risk', 'medium risk', 'high risk', or 'extreme risk'.

2. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a bounding box around an object of interest in an image. For instance, in a fire risk map application, bounding boxes could be drawn around areas with high fire risk.

3. Semantic segmentation: This method involves labeling each pixel in an image with a specific class. For example, in a fire risk map, different land cover types (e.g., grass, trees, buildings) could be segmented and assigned a fire risk class.

4. Instance segmentation: This technique combines object detection (bounding box annotation) and semantic segmentation. Each instance of an object is segmented and assigned a unique identifier. For example, in a fire risk map, individual trees could be segmented and labeled with their corresponding fire risk class.

5. Pixel-level annotation: This method involves annotating each pixel in an image with a specific value or class. It is commonly used in applications like image restoration, depth estimation, and semantic segmentation.

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the study likely used image-level classification for the fire risk maps. However, specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not provided.
