The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline in the given context are primarily tabular or structured data formats, such as CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files.

The study focuses on the analysis of various datasets, including weather data, micro-meteorological data, and land cover data. These datasets are acquired from different sources, such as weather stations, EC towers, and satellite imagery. The weather and micro-meteorological data are processed and cleaned, resulting in a dataset with 12 features, such as U2, Rs, RHmin, RHmax, Tmin, Tmax, ETo, SWC, NDVI, NDWI, DOY, and instrument information. This dataset is then arranged in a tabular format, with each row representing a specific time-step and each column representing a feature.

In the context provided, there is no mention of using image, audio, or video data formats in the deep learning pipeline. However, satellite imagery is used as a data source, and the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) features are derived from this imagery. These indices are calculated based on the reflectance values of specific spectral bands, which are then processed and incorporated into the tabular dataset.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in this study primarily uses tabular data formats, such as CSV files, containing processed and cleaned weather, micro-meteorological, and land cover data. While satellite imagery is used as a data source, the resulting features are incorporated into a tabular dataset for further analysis.
