The provided context does not explicitly mention which framework was used to build the deep learning model. The text focuses on the evaluation of the machine learning (ML) model's performance and its impact on tagging efficiency in the context of wildlife monitoring using camera traps. Mentioned are various studies that have released open-source species-level classification models, but the specific frameworks used in those models are not specified. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
