The provided context does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validation of the deep learning model. However, it does provide information about the composition of the training datasets T1 to T4.

T1 contained thumbnails of whole fish, T2 contained thumbnails of part of fish species, T3 contained thumbnails of whole fish, part of fish species, and environment, and T4 contained thumbnails from T3 minus the "part of fish", replaced by 20 classes "part of species" obtained by splitting thumbnails from each species.

Additionally, the context describes two decision rules applied to the raw outputs of the model: r1, which keeps the most likely fish class if "environment" was the most likely class, and r2, which considers "part of species X" equivalent to "species X".

The testing of the model's performance involved comparing the performance of the four models trained using each of the four training datasets and testing the performance of the models after correcting their raw outputs using the two a posteriori decision rules.

Therefore, while the context does not provide explicit information on the data splitting criteria for training, testing, and validation, it can be inferred that the data was split into training and testing sets, and possibly a validation set, during the training process of the four models. However, the specific details of this split are not provided.
