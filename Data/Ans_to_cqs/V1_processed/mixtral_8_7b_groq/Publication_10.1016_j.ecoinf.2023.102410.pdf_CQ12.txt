Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating what type of deep learning model was used in the data analysis pipeline. The text describes a study on bird song analysis, outlining the methodology and authorship contributions. However, it does not specify the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers.

The context includes a table (Table 1) presenting the number of tracked vocalisations of each song structure as a proportion of the whole dataset, as well as CRediT authorship contribution statements detailing the roles of each author. The data availability statement mentions that the link to the data is shared in the manuscript. However, none of these sections mention the use of a deep learning model.

Therefore, the answer to the query is:

 The provided context does not specify the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
