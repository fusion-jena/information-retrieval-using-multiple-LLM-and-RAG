Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline for analyzing gaping data. The text focuses on the data collection, processing, and analysis of gaping data in the Venice Lagoon and the Wadden Sea, but it does not mention any data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline.

Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize. However, the context does not provide information on whether these or any other data augmentation techniques were used in this specific study.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
