The context provided does not give information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It focuses more on the parameter configurations and optimization processes of the convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Therefore, I cannot provide the specific datasets used in this case. The datasets used in deep learning research and applications can vary widely, and common examples include MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, CIFAR for image classification, and ImageNet for large-scale object recognition. However, without additional information, it is not possible to determine which of these or other datasets were used in the context provided.
