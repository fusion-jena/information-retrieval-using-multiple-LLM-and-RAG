In the context provided, there is no explicit information given about the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. However, it is a common practice in machine learning to split the data into three subsets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to train the model, i.e., to find the model parameters that minimize the error on the training data. The validation set is used during the training process to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and performs poorly on unseen data. The validation set helps to assess the model's performance on new data and choose the best model among different candidates.

The testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. It is the only data set that the model has not seen during the training and validation process. The testing set provides an unbiased estimate of the model's generalization ability, i.e., its ability to perform well on new, unseen data.

The criteria used to split the data into these subsets can vary. A common approach is to use a random split, where a certain percentage of the data is assigned to each subset. For example, 60% of the data can be used for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing. Another approach is to use a time-based split, where the data is split based on its time stamp. For instance, the oldest data can be used for training, the most recent data for validation, and the data in between for testing.

In the context of deep learning, the data split criteria can depend on the specific application and data availability. For instance, in the Kovalev et al. (2016) paper, the authors use a 90/10 split for training and testing their deep learning models. They do not mention a validation set, but it can be assumed that they used cross-validation, a technique where multiple subsets of the training data are used for validation, to tune the hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

In summary, while the context provided does not give explicit information about the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training, it is a common practice to use a training, validation, and testing split. The criteria used to split the data can vary and can depend on the specific application and data availability.
