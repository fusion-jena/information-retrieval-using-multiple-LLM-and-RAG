The provided context does not mention a data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNN), for image classification. The text describes the specific methods used to train the CNN, such as the activation functions, optimizer, and number of iterations. However, it does not provide information about where the data or code for this pipeline might be found. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific repository where the data or code for this deep learning pipeline is available.
