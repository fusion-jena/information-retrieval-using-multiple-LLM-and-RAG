The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It mentions that training a model with data input of gibbon vocalizations is very computationally costly, and that pre-trained models were chosen to test due to this. However, it does not specify the type of hardware used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
