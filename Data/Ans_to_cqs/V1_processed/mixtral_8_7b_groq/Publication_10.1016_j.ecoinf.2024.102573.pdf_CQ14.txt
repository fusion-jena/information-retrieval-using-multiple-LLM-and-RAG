The context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization methods. The text focuses on comparing the performance of different frontends and their impact on the results, but it does not detail the optimization process for the hyperparameters. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer this question accurately.
