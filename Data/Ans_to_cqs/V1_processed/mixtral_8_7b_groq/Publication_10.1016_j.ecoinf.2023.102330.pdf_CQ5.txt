The provided context does not give information about the specific datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet) used in the deep learning pipeline for the study. However, it does mention that a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on covey call spectrogram data collected from Di-Lane and other sites around Georgia and Alabama, USA. The CNN model was trained to detect and localize all covey calls per ARU (Acoustic Recording Unit) during the recording period and note their associated time and peak power.

In general, the choice of dataset depends on the specific problem or task at hand. For image classification tasks, popular datasets include MNIST (handwritten digit recognition), CIFAR (object recognition in natural images), and ImageNet (large-scale image recognition). For other tasks such as speech recognition, natural language processing, or time-series data, different datasets would be used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that a custom dataset of covey call spectrograms was used for training the CNN model. However, the specific details of this dataset are not provided in the context.
