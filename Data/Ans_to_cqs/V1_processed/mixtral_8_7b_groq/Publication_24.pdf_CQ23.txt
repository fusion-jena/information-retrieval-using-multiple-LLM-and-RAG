In summary, while the article by Fairbrass et al. (2019) does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, we can infer that some measures were taken, such as using a diverse dataset, CNNs, well-established machine learning libraries and tools, and data normalization. However, it is not clear whether the authors used cross-validation or stratified splitting to further evaluate the model's generalizability.
