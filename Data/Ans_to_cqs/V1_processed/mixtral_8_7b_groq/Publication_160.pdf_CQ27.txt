Based on the provided context, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned. However, there are some indications of steps that might have been taken.

Firstly, the performances of different ResNet architectures were evaluated on validation and test sets (Table 3). This suggests that the models were trained, validated, and tested, which are typical steps in the process of deploying a deep learning model.

Secondly, the text mentions that an ensemble of four ResNet18s was created by independently training them on four patch sizes and then fine-tuning the ensemble (using a batch size of 128 and freezing the weights from the initial training). This implies that the models were saved and loaded during the fine-tuning process. Model serialization is a common practice for saving and loading trained models, so it is likely that this step was followed.

Lastly, the platform selection is not mentioned in the context. However, it can be inferred that the models were tested and validated on a machine with sufficient computational resources to handle the training of deep neural networks.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit details on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the models were trained, validated, and tested, and that model serialization was likely used during the fine-tuning of the ensemble. The platform selection is not mentioned.
