The data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for bacterial image recognition in environmental samples are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that a partially trained model was used to annotate new data before further training. This suggests that some form of image segmentation or classification was used, where the model learned to identify and label specific features or objects within the images during its initial training phase.

The annotated dataset contained 540 training images and 141 validation images, which were manually checked and edited by a human. This process might have involved correcting any misclassifications or refining the boundaries of the labeled objects, thereby improving the quality of the annotations.

For a smaller dataset consisting of images from Kenya, a fine-tuning process was applied to adapt the model to the specific characteristics of the lower-quality images. This fine-tuning step could have involved adjusting the pre-trained model's parameters to better recognize and classify the objects within the new dataset.

While the specific annotation techniques are not specified, the context implies that the deep learning pipeline involved a combination of partial training, self-annotation, manual checking, and fine-tuning to prepare and annotate the datasets for bacterial image recognition.
