Based on the information provided, the performance of the deep learning model, referred to as the ApisFis model, is evaluated through a comparison with field estimation data for 12 sites. The assessment focuses on the accuracy of the model in estimating the pollination outcomes for each site.

The field estimation outcomes are categorized as low, moderate, or suitable, and the ApisFis model yields very similar results for sites 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12. However, for some sites, the field estimations were higher than the model prediction (Sites 1, 3, and 7), and for other sites, the field estimations were lower than the ApisFis model outcomes (Sites 5, 9, 10, and 11).

Although the text does not explicitly mention the use of metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall, it can be inferred that the model's performance is being evaluated in terms of its ability to closely match the field estimation outcomes. The comparison of the ApisFis model with the field data serves as a measure of the model's validity and reliability.

Additionally, the text references other studies that have noted the impact of reducing pixel size on the value of pollination models. Grafius et al. (2016) found that reducing the pixel size from 25 m to 5 m in urban areas increased the pollination model's value, while Rayner et al. (2021) reported a 43% improvement in the prediction of wild bee abundance when reducing the pixel size from 100 to 10 m. These findings suggest that the choice of spatial resolution can influence the accuracy of pollination models, but they do not directly relate to the evaluation metrics used for the ApisFis model.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics for the ApisFis model, it can be inferred that the model's performance is being assessed based on its ability to match field estimation outcomes for the 12 sites. Other studies have highlighted the importance of spatial resolution in pollination models, but these findings are not directly related to the evaluation metrics used for the ApisFis model.
