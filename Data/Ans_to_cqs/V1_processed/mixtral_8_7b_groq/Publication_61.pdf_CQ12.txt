Based on the provided context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the description of the max pooling operation, flattening of features to a one-dimensional vector, and the application of fully connected layers. These are all components commonly found in a CNN. Furthermore, there is no mention of other types of deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the given context.
