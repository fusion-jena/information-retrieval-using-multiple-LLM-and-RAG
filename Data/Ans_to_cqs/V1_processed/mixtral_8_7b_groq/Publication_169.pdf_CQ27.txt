The text provided does not give a detailed explanation of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the CNN-LSTM model was implemented using the Python library Keras, which suggests that the model could have been saved and loaded using the built-in functions provided by Keras for model serialization.

To save the model, Keras provides the `model.save()` function, which saves the model architecture and weights to a single file. This file can then be used to re-create the model, using the `load_model()` function. This approach would allow for the model to be easily deployed to a variety of platforms, as the saved model file can be loaded and used in any environment that supports Keras.

Additionally, the text also mentions that the system specifications include an Intel(R)Core i7-4790@ 3.6GHz CPU and 16GB of RAM, which suggests that the model was trained and tested on a local machine. However, it does not provide information on whether the model was deployed to any other platforms for real-world use.

In summary, while the text does not provide a detailed explanation of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the model was likely saved and loaded using the built-in functions provided by Keras, and it was trained and tested on a local machine with an Intel(R)Core i7-4790@ 3.6GHz CPU and 16GB of RAM.
