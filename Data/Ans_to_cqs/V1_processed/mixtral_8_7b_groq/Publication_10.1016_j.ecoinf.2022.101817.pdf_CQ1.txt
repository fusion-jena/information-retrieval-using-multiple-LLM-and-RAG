The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of public datasets and videos in the training and testing of deep learning models for environmental condition classification.

In the study by Deng et al. (2009), the authors introduced ImageNet, a large-scale hierarchical image database that has been widely used in the development of computer vision and pattern recognition algorithms. ImageNet contains over 14 million images, which were collected through various means such as web search and manual annotation.

In the study by Soom et al. (n.d.), the authors used a dataset of 1500 videos, from which they extracted 8 frames per video, resulting in a total of 12,000 frames. These frames were then used to generate five different datasets for training and testing five CNN models. However, the context does not provide information on where these videos came from or how they were collected.

In the study by Dwivedi (2021), the author discussed the role of digital technology in freshwater biodiversity monitoring through citizen science during the COVID-19 pandemic. While this study does not focus on deep learning, it does highlight the potential of using public datasets generated through citizen science for environmental monitoring and conservation.

Overall, while the provided context does not give specific details on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest the use of public datasets and videos for training and testing deep learning models for environmental condition classification. Additionally, studies in related fields have shown the potential of using citizen science and other data collection methods for environmental monitoring and conservation.
