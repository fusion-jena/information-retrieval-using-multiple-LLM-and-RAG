The provided context does not include information about the optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. The text focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms, specifically random forest and maximum entropy modeling, for predicting the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease in South Korea. It discusses various factors affecting pine wilt disease, such as geographical, meteorological, and land-use characteristics, and how these models help in understanding and managing ecological data.

However, it is important to note that optimization techniques like SGD and Adam are commonly used in deep learning for training models, adjusting parameters, and minimizing losses. These techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the given context, as the focus is on machine learning algorithms and their application in ecological informatics.
