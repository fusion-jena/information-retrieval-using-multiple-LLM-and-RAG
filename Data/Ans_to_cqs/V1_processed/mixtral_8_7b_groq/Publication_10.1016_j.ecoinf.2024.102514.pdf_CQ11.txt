Based on the provided context, there is no specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. However, some of the research papers mentioned in the context have used machine learning and deep learning techniques for various applications related to environmental management and water quality.

For instance, the paper "Assessing water quality of an ecologically critical urban canal incorporating machine learning approaches" (Sajib et al., 2024) might have used a data repository for sharing the code and data used in the study. However, the context does not provide a specific link to the repository.

Another paper by Vu et al. (2022) analyzed the input set characteristics and variances on k-fold cross-validation for a recurrent neural network model on waste disposal rate estimation. However, the paper does not mention any data repository link.

The paper "Water quality prediction using KNN imputer and multilayer perceptron" (Juna et al., 2022) predicted water quality using machine learning techniques. The paper used a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, but it does not mention any data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study.

In summary, while some of the papers mentioned in the context have used machine learning and deep learning techniques for environmental management and water quality applications, there is no specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline provided in the context. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
