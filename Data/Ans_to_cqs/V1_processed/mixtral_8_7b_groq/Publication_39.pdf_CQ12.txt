The deep learning models used in the pipeline are all based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, the models are built using Python 3 and PyTorch, and the Mask R-CNN model is used for object detection. The ResNet variations used for action recognition are also built on top of PyTorch detection models, which are CNN-based. Furthermore, the backbone of the Feature Pyramid Flow Network (FGFA) model is extracted from a Mask R-CNN network trained on a segmentation dataset, and the head and Region Proposal Network (RPN) of the FGFA model are trained during the training process. The flow network in the FGFA architecture is implemented with SPyNet, which is also a CNN-based model. Therefore, all the models used in the pipeline are based on CNNs.
