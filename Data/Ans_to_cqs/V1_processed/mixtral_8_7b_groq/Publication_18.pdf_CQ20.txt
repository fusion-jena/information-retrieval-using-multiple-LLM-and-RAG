The specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models described in the given context are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that likely high-end GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) were used, as they are commonly used for deep learning due to their ability to perform many computations simultaneously.

For example, the model described in paper 54, "Dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer with deep neural networks" was trained using "a single NVIDIA Titan X GPU" (Esteva et al., 2017). Similarly, paper 56, "Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search" mentions that "we used a cluster of 256 CPUs and 4 Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)" but it's not clear if the TPUs were used for training the deep learning model (Silver et al., 2016).

Additionally, some of the papers describe the use of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow (Esteva et al., 2017) and Caffe (Kim et al., 2016), which can be used to run deep learning models on GPUs.

It's also worth noting that, in general, training deep learning models can be computationally intensive and requires a significant amount of memory, so it is common to use multiple GPUs or specialized hardware such as TPUs to speed up the training process.

Another important aspect to consider is that, some of the models described in the papers are very deep and complex, such as the Inception-v4 model (Szegedy et al., 2016) or the models used in the object detection field (Redmon & Farhadi, 2017; Lin et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018; Fu et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018) which would require a lot of computational resources.

In conclusion, while the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models described in the given context are not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that likely high-end GPUs were used, and possibly specialized hardware such as TPUs. Additionally, the use of deep learning frameworks and the complexity of the models suggest that significant computational resources were required.
