The text provided does not give explicit information about how the raw data was collected for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. However, it does mention that the raw data consists of marine images from Australian seas, specifically from the Western Australia (WA) subset of the Benthoz15 dataset. Therefore, it can be inferred that the raw data was collected using underwater cameras or similar imaging devices, either through a dedicated survey or by using existing public datasets.

The Benthoz15 dataset is described as consisting of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images, which suggests that the data was collected as part of a scientific survey or research project, rather than from publicly available sources. The dataset is further described as containing 4,750 images with 237,500 expert-annotated points collected over a span of 3 years (2011 to 2013). This level of detail and annotation indicates a significant investment of time and resources in data collection and annotation.

Additionally, the pre-processing step applied to the data involved a color channel stretch, which further suggests that the data is in the form of images. The color channel stretch involved calculating the 1% and 99% intensity percentiles for each color channel, subtracting the lower intensity from all the intensities in each respective channel, setting negative values to zero, and dividing the resulting intensities by the upper percentile. This pre-processing step was applied to improve the performance of the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, while the text does not provide explicit information about how the raw data was collected, it can be inferred that the data was collected using underwater cameras or similar imaging devices, either through a dedicated survey or by using existing public datasets. The dataset was then expert-annotated and pre-processed to improve the performance of the deep learning pipeline.
