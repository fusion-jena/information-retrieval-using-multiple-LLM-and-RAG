The provided context discusses various techniques and approaches related to transfer learning (TL), hesitancy, and uncertainty restriction in the context of data distribution differences between source and target domains. However, it does not directly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value.

In general, deep learning models can incorporate randomness in several ways, including:

1. Initialization of weights: Deep learning models typically initialize weights randomly at the beginning of training. This randomness helps the model explore different areas of the weight space and can impact the final model's performance.
2. Data augmentation: Data augmentation techniques, like rotation, scaling, or flipping, can introduce randomness by creating new synthetic samples from the existing dataset.
3. Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out a fraction of neurons during training, preventing overfitting and promoting generalization.
4. Batch normalization: Batch normalization involves normalizing the inputs of each layer, which can be helpful in reducing internal covariate shift and improving model convergence. It also introduces randomness by shuffling the data at each training iteration.
5. Learning rate schedules: Learning rate schedules, such as step decay or exponential decay, can introduce randomness by changing the learning rate at different stages of training.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, it is a common practice in deep learning to set a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. By fixing the random seed value, the randomness introduced during the training process, such as weight initialization or data shuffling, will be consistent across multiple runs, allowing researchers and practitioners to compare results and draw more reliable conclusions.

In summary, although the provided context does not discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, deep learning models can incorporate randomness through various techniques, such as weight initialization, data augmentation, dropout, batch normalization, and learning rate schedules. Setting a fixed random seed value is a common practice to ensure reproducibility in deep learning experiments.
