Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the use of diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the model performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix with various metrics such as Cohen’s kappa coefficient (κ), Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Prevalence. These metrics are commonly used to assess the performance and generalizability of machine learning models.

Moreover, the study used Gonadosomatic Index (GSI) and relative condition factor (Krel) as indicators of fish maturity and nutritional status. These indicators could be considered as part of the diverse dataset to ensure that the model is trained on a wide range of fish samples with varying maturity stages and nutritional conditions.

In addition, the study mentioned the application of machine learning techniques such as Boosted Regression Trees, Random Forests, and Convolutional Neural Networks in fisheries biology. These techniques have been successful in various studies and could potentially improve the generalizability of the deep learning model.

Therefore, while there is no explicit information about the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting, the use of various performance metrics, indicators of fish maturity and nutritional status, and the application of successful machine learning techniques suggest that some measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
