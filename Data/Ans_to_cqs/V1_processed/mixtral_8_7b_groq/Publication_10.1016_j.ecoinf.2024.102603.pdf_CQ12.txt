The provided context does not specify the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions deep learning models in general, without distinguishing between different types such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers. Therefore, I cannot give a definitive answer to this query.
