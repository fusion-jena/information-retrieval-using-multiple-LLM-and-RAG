The provided context discusses machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest Regression (RFR) and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), but it does not directly mention deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. However, I can provide some insights into handling randomness in machine learning models, which can be relevant to deep learning as well.

In machine learning, randomness can be introduced during various stages of the model development process, such as data splitting, feature selection, and model initialization. Strategies to handle randomness include:

1. **Fixed random seed value**: To ensure reproducibility, you can set a fixed random seed value. This ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of random numbers, making your results consistent across multiple runs. For example, in Python, you can set the random seed using `numpy.random.seed()` or `random.seed()`.

2. **Cross-validation**: Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance and generalization ability of a machine learning model. By dividing the dataset into multiple folds and training the model on different subsets, cross-validation helps reduce the impact of randomness and overfitting.

3. **Ensemble methods**: Techniques like Random Forests, which combine multiple decision trees, help reduce the impact of randomness by aggregating the predictions of multiple models. This can lead to more stable and accurate predictions.

4. **Model tuning and regularization**: Strategies like grid search or random search can help identify the best set of hyperparameters for a model, reducing the impact of randomness. Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, can also help prevent overfitting and improve model performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, the strategies mentioned above can be applied to deep learning models as well. These strategies include setting a fixed random seed value, using cross-validation, employing ensemble methods, and tuning models with regularization techniques.
