The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on discussing various deep learning architectures such as VGG nets, ResNet, RepVGG, and MobileNet-V3, along with their respective performance and complexity. It also mentions the use of ResNet-18, ResNet-50, RepVGG-A0, and RepVGG-A1 in certain experiments. However, there is no information about where the code for these experiments or the deep learning pipeline is hosted, such as on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
