The provided context does not include detailed information on the deployment process of the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of TensorFlow, a popular open-source platform for machine learning and deep learning models. TensorFlow provides capabilities for model serialization, which involves saving the trained model's architecture, weights, and biases to a file, allowing it to be loaded and used for making predictions on new data.

Another important aspect of deploying a deep learning model is platform selection. The context does not explicitly mention the platform used for deployment. However, TensorFlow supports deployment on various platforms, including cloud services (e.g., Google Cloud, AWS), edge devices (e.g., mobile phones, embedded systems), and custom servers.

In summary, while the provided context does not offer detailed information on the deployment process, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized using TensorFlow, and then deployed on a platform suitable for the specific application. To obtain more accurate information, additional context or documentation specific to the model's deployment would be required.
