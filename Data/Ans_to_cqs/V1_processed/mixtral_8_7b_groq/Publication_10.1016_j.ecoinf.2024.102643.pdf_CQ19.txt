The provided context does not specifically mention the use of any deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for building models. The context discusses various analytical methods and statistical techniques used in forest management and habitat fragmentation studies, including Maximum Entropy (MAXENT), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Generalized Boosted Model (GBM), Classification Tree Analyses (CTA), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), and Surface Response Envelope (SRE). However, these methods are not deep learning frameworks.

Deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch are used to design, train, and implement deep learning models, which are a subset of machine learning models. These frameworks provide tools and libraries for building complex neural network architectures and performing various computations required for deep learning.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which deep learning frameworks are used for building deep learning models in TÃ¼rkiye's forest management and habitat fragmentation studies.
