Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention some details about the training process and the evaluation metrics used.

During the training phase, the models were trained for 40 epochs with a batch size of 8. The learning rate was scheduled to follow a warm-up and cosine decay strategy for YOLOX and YOLOv8. The classification loss was calculated using Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE), and the location loss was calculated using Intersection over Union (IoU). Data augmentation techniques such as color jitter, mosaic, random crop, and scale augmentation were also applied during training.

As for the evaluation metrics, the context does not provide specific details about the postprocessing steps like calculating confusion matrices or generating saliency maps. However, it does mention that the primary hyperparameter settings of the three detection models were evaluated using the Average Precision (AP) metric.

Therefore, based on the given context, we can infer that the postprocessing steps after model training may include calculating evaluation metrics such as Average Precision (AP), but there is no explicit information about other postprocessing steps like generating saliency maps or creating confusion matrices.
