The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context of the wav2vec model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it is common practice in machine learning to use a variety of methods to assess convergence and determine when training should be stopped. One such method is monitoring the validation loss and stopping training when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model is overfitting to the training data.

In the case of the wav2vec model, the text mentions that the loss and accuracy plots in Figures 12 and 13 show the performance of the proposed transfer learning approach using the wav2vec model. These plots could be used to assess convergence and determine when training should be stopped. For example, if the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase over several epochs, training could be stopped to prevent overfitting.

Additionally, the text mentions that the wav2vec model is pre-trained on a large audio dataset using a self-supervised learning approach. This pre-training phase involves optimizing the model's ability to recognize whether two different types of transformations of the input are the same or not. The pre-training objective includes a diversity loss term, which is added to the objective function for regularization during pre-training. This diversity loss term encourages the model to make diverse predictions for the masked latent feature representations, which could help prevent overfitting during pre-training.

Overall, while the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the wav2vec model are not mentioned in the provided text, it is likely that common practices such as monitoring the validation loss and assessing convergence are used. The pre-training phase of the wav2vec model also includes regularization techniques that could help prevent overfitting during pre-training.
