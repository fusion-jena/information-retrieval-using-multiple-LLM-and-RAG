The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline described in the provided context is an augmented version of PlanVillage. The dataset is used after pre-processing steps, which include a complex data augmentation technique to increase the number of images from 55,448 to 61,486 images. Additionally, an image enhancement technique is added to provide crystal-clear images for further examination. However, the specific details about the original PlanVillage dataset, such as its size and composition before augmentation, are not provided in the context. Therefore, it is not possible to compare it with other standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

In summary, the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline described in the provided context is an augmented version of PlanVillage, and it is used after pre-processing steps that include data augmentation and image enhancement techniques.
