The provided pieces of context do not mention any deep learning pipeline or specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, they discuss marine biology topics, including seahorse species occurrences, bioclimatic modeling, and citizen science data collection.

In the context, the researchers collected seahorse occurrence data from various sources, such as citizen science surveys, social media, diving centers, fishing events, and questionnaires. They received 115 replies with geographical coordinates of H. guttulatus and H. hippocampus sightings. These data points were then visually inspected using Google Earth Pro to retain only the points falling in areas consistent with the known species' geographical distribution.

However, these datasets are not standard deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. These datasets are typically used for tasks such as image classification, object detection, or other computer vision tasks.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given context.
