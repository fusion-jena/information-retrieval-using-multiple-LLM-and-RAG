In the contexts provided, there are no explicit strategies mentioned for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as using a random seed value. However, there are some related concepts that are discussed, such as the use of large datasets and clustering algorithms.

In [8] and [9], the authors use large datasets of hyper-spectral bottom index imagery and a deep convolutional neural network (VGG-19) for coral reef bottom-type classification. The need for a massive dataset is emphasized for achieving higher accuracy. While not explicitly stated, using a fixed random seed value could be a strategy to ensure reproducibility of results when working with large datasets.

In the algorithm for Silhouette Analysis (Algorithm 2), randomness is not directly addressed. However, the algorithm does involve calculating distances between features and cluster centers, which could be affected by randomness in the data. The use of a fixed random seed value could help ensure consistent results when calculating these distances.

In [18], the authors use ResNet50 and LSTM with soft attention for automatic image captioning. While not explicitly mentioned, using a fixed random seed value could be a strategy to ensure reproducibility of results in this context as well.

In [20], the authors use GoogLeNet CNN neural network for chest CT coronavirus medical image classification. Again, while not explicitly stated, using a fixed random seed value could be a strategy to ensure reproducibility of results.

In [22], the authors use Google Earth Engine for drone image processing to map coral reef substrates. While not directly related to deep learning, the use of a fixed random seed value could be a strategy to ensure reproducibility of results in this context as well.

In [23], the authors use a neural network for recognizing marine benthos and corals. While not explicitly mentioned, using a fixed random seed value could be a strategy to ensure reproducibility of results.

In summary, while not explicitly stated in the provided contexts, using a fixed random seed value could be a strategy to ensure reproducibility of results in deep learning pipelines that involve large datasets, clustering algorithms, and neural networks.
