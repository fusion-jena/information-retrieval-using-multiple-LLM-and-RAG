The text provided does not give specific details about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it mentions the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN), which typically involves the optimization of hyperparameters such as the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, the learning rate, and the type of activation function.

In the context of CNNs, hyperparameter optimization is often done using methods such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves systematically trying out different combinations of hyperparameters within a predefined range. Random search, on the other hand, involves randomly selecting hyperparameters from a defined range. Bayesian optimization, a more sophisticated method, uses Bayes' theorem to model the relationship between hyperparameters and the performance of the model, and then selects new hyperparameters to try based on this model.

The text mentions the use of an activation function (f) in the model, which is a type of hyperparameter. However, it does not provide information on how this hyperparameter is optimized.

In summary, while the text provides information on the use of a CNN for ecological informatics, it does not give specific details about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization in CNNs include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.
