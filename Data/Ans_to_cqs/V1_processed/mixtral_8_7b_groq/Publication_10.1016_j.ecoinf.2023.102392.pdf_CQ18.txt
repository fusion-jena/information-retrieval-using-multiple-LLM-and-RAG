The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance was evaluated using various metrics such as LULC accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, overall accuracy (OA), and kappa. These metrics were calculated for the years 2005 and 2022, and for the forest types. Therefore, it can be assumed that the model performance was monitored by calculating these metrics at regular intervals during the training process. Additionally, the authors mentioned that they used the XGBoost method for land use/land cover classification and for predicting the accuracy of forest types in the study site. The XGBoost method is a popular machine learning algorithm that is known for its performance and versatility. It is possible that the algorithm has built-in mechanisms for monitoring the model performance during training. However, without explicit information in the context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
