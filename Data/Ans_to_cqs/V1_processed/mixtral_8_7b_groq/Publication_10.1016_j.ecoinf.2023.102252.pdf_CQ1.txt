Based on the provided context, the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for the study related to environmental flow, riparian ecosystem, wetland, and biodiversity maintenance are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the study utilizes detailed meteorological, soil, and vegetation data.

The meteorological data may include information on temperature, precipitation, humidity, and other weather-related factors, which could be obtained from weather stations, satellites, or reanalysis datasets. The soil data might encompass properties such as texture, structure, organic matter content, and water holding capacity, which could be sourced from soil surveys, laboratory analyses, or digital soil maps. The vegetation data could consist of information on plant species, biomass, leaf area index, and other vegetation-related variables, which might be derived from field surveys, remote sensing, or ecological databases.

It is important to note that the study emphasizes the significant data requirements and substantial computational costs associated with the highly detailed modeling of physical processes. This suggests that the data collection process likely involved multiple sources and methods to ensure the comprehensive and accurate representation of the environmental and ecological variables.

In summary, while the specific methods for data collection are not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that the study utilizes detailed meteorological, soil, and vegetation data, which may be obtained through various sources such as weather stations, soil surveys, and ecological databases.
