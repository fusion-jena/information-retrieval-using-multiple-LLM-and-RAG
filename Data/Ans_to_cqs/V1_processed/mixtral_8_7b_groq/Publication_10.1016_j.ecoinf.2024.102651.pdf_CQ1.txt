The provided context does not contain specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of datasets for training and testing deep learning models in the context of image classification.

In the first piece of context, a network based on CNN and ViT modules classified microorganisms with an accuracy of 67.62% using a dataset. Similarly, the second piece of context mentions the use of two datasets to train and test a hybrid network composed of CNN and transformer for insect pest classification, achieving accuracies of 99.472% and 97.935%. The third piece of context also mentions the use of a dataset for training and testing a CA-Hybrid network for Cervidae classification.

Therefore, it can be inferred that public datasets, surveys, or sensors may have been used to collect the raw data for these studies. Public datasets are often used in deep learning research, as they provide a large amount of labeled data that can be used to train and test models. Surveys and sensors can also be used to collect raw data, particularly in the context of image or signal processing.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that public datasets, surveys, or sensors may have been used.
