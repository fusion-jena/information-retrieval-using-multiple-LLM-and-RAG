Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include resizing, augmentation, and manual review of images. However, it does not explicitly mention normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Firstly, all images were resized to 224 x 224 pixels before training. This step is crucial as deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), require a fixed-size input. Resizing ensures that all images have the same dimensions, enabling the model to process them uniformly.

Secondly, image augmentation was applied to expand the dataset. Augmentation techniques such as shifts, horizontal flips, rotations, zooms, and shears were used to increase the diversity of the training data. This step helps improve the model's ability to generalize and reduces overfitting.

Lastly, manual review of images is an essential preprocessing step. When selecting new training images, it is crucial to review them manually instead of relying solely on model outputs. Manual review ensures that misclassified images are not included in the training data, which could negatively impact the model's performance.

While the text does not explicitly mention normalization or scaling, these steps are commonly used in deep learning preprocessing. Normalization involves scaling pixel values to a range between 0 and 1, while scaling can refer to adjusting the pixel values based on the dataset's statistical properties. These steps can help improve the model's convergence during training.

In conclusion, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, as described in the provided context, include resizing, augmentation, and manual review of images. However, it does not explicitly mention normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Nonetheless, these additional steps are commonly used in deep learning preprocessing.
