The provided context does not give specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. However, it is mentioned that deep learning models are applied in water quality management and analysis of spatial and temporal variation in water coverage. Commonly, deep learning models are trained using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which significantly speeds up the training process compared to Central Processing Units (CPUs). Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are another hardware resource specifically designed for machine learning tasks, including deep learning. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of GPUs, TPUs, or any other specific hardware for training the deep learning models.
