The deep learning pipeline in question uses two specific datasets: the detailed-labelled NIPS4Bplus dataset and a randomly selected 40% sample of the same dataset. The NIPS4Bplus dataset is a neural information processing dataset scaled for bioacoustics, as described in the "Neural Information Processing Scaled for Bioacoustics-from neurons to Big Data" publication from 2013. This dataset is used for training DNN models and comparing the results with another high-quality model, BirdNET.

The BirdNET model is used to generate embeddings on the 40% sample of the NIPS4Bplus dataset. These embeddings are then reduced in dimensionality from 420 to 2 dimensions using t-SNE, as depicted in Figure 2. BirdNET requires a 3-s sound input, which is extracted from the sound files in the dataset. However, it's noted that not always a whole 3-s extract can be obtained from the label start, due to the varying sound file lengths in the dataset.

It's important to note that the provided context does not mention any other standard datasets commonly used in deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The focus of this pipeline is specifically on the NIPS4Bplus dataset and its comparison with the BirdNET model.
