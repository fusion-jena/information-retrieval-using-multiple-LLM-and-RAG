Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in the experiment. However, some implicit indications suggest that the researchers might have employed certain techniques to enhance the model's generalizability.

First, the researchers conducted a comparative analysis of several models, including Rostcm 6.0, Simple Bayesian Networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), in pre-tests. This step implies that they might have considered the performance of these models on different datasets, which could have helped them select a more generalizable model.

Second, the researchers chose to employ the combined LSTM-CNN-based sentiment analysis framework for determining the sentiment index. The LSTM-CNN model combines the long-term memory capability of LSTM and the local feature extraction capability of CNN, which can potentially improve the model's ability to capture complex patterns in the data. This combination might have contributed to the model's generalizability.

However, these are indirect indications, and the context does not provide explicit information about the use of techniques such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to enhance the model's generalizability. Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
