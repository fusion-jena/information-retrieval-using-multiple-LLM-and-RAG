Based on the provided context, it does not appear that a deep learning model was used in the studies referenced. Instead, the studies primarily utilized a machine learning technique called Random Forest (RF). However, I can still provide some information on how the RF model was validated and tested for generalizability.

In the study by Raab et al. (2020), the RF model was validated using out-of-bag (OOB) samples, which are those not included in the training subset. Specifically, the total number of samples used for validation was 8. This approach allows for an unbiased estimate of the generalization error.

In the study by Ramoelo et al. (2015), the RF model was trained using 34 ground data points and tested for its potential to assess rangeland quality using Sentinel-2 spectral configuration. However, the specific validation approach was not mentioned.

In the study by Ranta et al. (2021), the RF model was employed to perform classification using Red Green Blue (RGB) images acquired in March, April, and May. The maximum shaft number value was tested from 1 to 100, and the minimum sample number from 1 to 50. However, the validation approach was not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, while the studies did not explicitly mention using measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, they did utilize validation techniques such as OOB samples and testing on a separate dataset to ensure the generalizability of the RF model.
