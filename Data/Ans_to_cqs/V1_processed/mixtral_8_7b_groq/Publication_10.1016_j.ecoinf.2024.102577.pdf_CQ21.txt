Based on the provided context, there are no specific details mentioned about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it is mentioned that the performance of the models was evaluated using 5x10-fold cross-validation, and the mean accuracies and standard deviations for each method and species were recorded in Table 4. It can be inferred that metrics calculation was done as part of the cross-validation process.

The context also mentions that a model was trained for each species using the selected variables, and the probabilities of finding high and low catches and absences of each species in the study area were predicted. This implies that the models were used for prediction, and the results of the validation of the trained models are shown in Table 5. However, there is no explicit mention of saliency maps or confusion matrix as part of the postprocessing steps.

In summary, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include metrics calculation as part of the cross-validation process and prediction using the trained models. However, there is no explicit mention of saliency maps or confusion matrix as part of the postprocessing steps.
