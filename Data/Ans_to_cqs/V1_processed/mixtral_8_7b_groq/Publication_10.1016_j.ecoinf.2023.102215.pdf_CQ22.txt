The performance of the deep learning model for salient tree trunk detection on ST-D is evaluated using seven metrics, as described in section 3.2. of the study. These metrics include Mean Absolute Error (M), F-measure (Fβ), and Weighted F-measure (Fωβ).

Mean Absolute Error (M) is used to assess the pixel-level similarity between the final saliency map Spre and the ground-truth mask G. It calculates the absolute difference between the ground-truth and the predicted saliency map, providing a measure of the overall error at the pixel level.

F-measure (Fβ) is used to estimate the harmonic mean of precision and recall, combining them into a single statistic Fβ. This metric assigns a greater weight to precision, as empirically set to 0.3, to emphasize the importance of precise predictions. The maximum Fβ (maxFβ) is also reported in the analysis of experimental results.

Weighted F-measure (Fωβ) is introduced to handle the unreasonable comparison caused by flaws of prediction. It introduces weight ω to Fβ to represent error at different locations. This metric further refines the evaluation of the model's performance by considering the impact of errors at various locations in the image.

In summary, the performance of the deep learning model for salient tree trunk detection is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (M), F-measure (Fβ), and Weighted F-measure (Fωβ). These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance, considering both overall error and location-specific errors.
