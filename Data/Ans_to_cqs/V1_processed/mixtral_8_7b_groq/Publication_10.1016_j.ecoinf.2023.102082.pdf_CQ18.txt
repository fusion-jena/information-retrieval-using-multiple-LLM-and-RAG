The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the authors validated the Potapov30m model using Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data, which showed a Mean Error (ME) of 3.8 m, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 9.07 m, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 6.36 m. This validation was performed after the model training, but it still provides insights into the model's performance.

Moreover, the authors used high-quality training and validation data for the modeling process. They only used observations collected in power beam mode, during the night, and with beam sensitivity 0.9. They also excluded observations collected during the leaf-off season in temperate and boreal forests. This selection of high-quality data can be seen as a strategy to ensure the model's performance during training.

In addition, the Potapov30m model was derived using a regression tree algorithm, GEDI, Landsat, and SRTM data. The estimate of GEDI canopy height used in the models represents the 95th percentile of energy return height relative to the ground (RH95). These data and methods could also be considered strategies to monitor the model performance during training.

Overall, while the context does not explicitly mention a strategy to monitor the model performance during training, it does provide information on the validation process, the selection of high-quality data, and the data and methods used for modeling. These elements can be seen as strategies to ensure the model's performance during training.
