The provided context discusses various aspects of deep learning model training, including hyperparameter optimization and model evaluation, but it does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validation. However, it is generally understood in the field of machine learning that data splitting is a crucial step in the model development process.

In deep learning, data is typically split into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model's parameters, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

The specific criteria used to split the data can vary depending on the problem and the dataset's size. A common approach is to use a random split, where a certain percentage of the data is randomly assigned to each subset. For instance, 70% of the data might be used for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. This method ensures that each subset is representative of the overall dataset.

Another approach is to use stratified sampling, which ensures that each subset has the same distribution of labels as the original dataset. This method is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where some classes may be underrepresented.

In some cases, data may be split based on temporal or spatial considerations. For example, in time series forecasting, it is common to use a rolling window approach, where the most recent data is used for testing, the data prior to that for validation, and so on.

The provided context does mention that model evaluation was performed on two datasets, but it does not specify how the data was split. It is possible that a random split was used, or that the data was split based on some other criterion appropriate for the specific problem.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it is a well-established practice in the field to use a training, validation, and testing split. The specific criteria used can vary depending on the problem and dataset, but common approaches include random sampling, stratified sampling, and temporal or spatial considerations.
