Based on the information provided, there is no mention of a code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The study mentions that deep learning algorithms were considered but not implemented due to the limited number of samples. Therefore, it is likely that the deep learning pipeline was not developed far enough to warrant a code repository. If the code repository becomes available in the future, it would likely be found on popular platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. For now, the codes and algorithms used in the study may be obtained by contacting the authors or the research institution directly.
