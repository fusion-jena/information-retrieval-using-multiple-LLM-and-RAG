The provided context discusses the use of a stratified random sampling technique to address data bias during the preprocessing of a machine learning pipeline, specifically for the generation of above-ground biomass (AGB) maps. However, it does not mention other techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling is a method used to ensure that the training/testing dataset accurately represents the distribution of the target variable within the population. In the context of Hudak et al. (2020), half of the pixels were randomly selected for the training and testing split, with the goal of capturing the full distribution of AGB values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps. This approach was chosen to ensure that the AGB maps generated were accurate and representative of the distribution of AGB values in the study area.

While the context does not explicitly mention oversampling or undersampling techniques, it is important to note that these methods can also be used to address data bias during preprocessing. Oversampling involves increasing the frequency of the minority class in the dataset, while undersampling involves reducing the frequency of the majority class. Both techniques aim to balance the dataset and improve model performance.

Diverse data collection is another technique that can be used to address data bias during preprocessing. By collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population, data bias can be minimized. This technique is particularly important in deep learning applications, where large datasets are required to train accurate models.

In summary, the provided context discusses the use of stratified sampling as a technique to address data bias during preprocessing. Other techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can also be used to address data bias during preprocessing, particularly in deep learning applications.
