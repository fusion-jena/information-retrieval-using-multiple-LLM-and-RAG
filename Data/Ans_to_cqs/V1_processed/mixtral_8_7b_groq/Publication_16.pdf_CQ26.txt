Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does provide information about data collection and preprocessing methods that can be used to infer potential bias mitigation techniques.

During data collection, the audio files are transmitted over 4G using SMTP and segmented into 15-second windows. Each sample window is then passed to the feature extractor function, where Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are used to extract features for the classifier. This feature extraction method, MFCC, is commonly used for speech and audio processing tasks and is known to be robust to noise and other variations.

In the preprocessing stage, the context does not explicitly mention any bias mitigation techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. However, the use of MFCC for feature extraction can help reduce bias by capturing relevant and robust features from the audio data.

The evaluation metrics used in the study include sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy. These metrics are commonly used for evaluating classification models and can help identify potential sources of bias in the model's performance.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly mention any bias mitigation techniques used during data preprocessing, the use of MFCC for feature extraction and evaluation metrics can help reduce bias in the model's performance. However, further information is needed to determine if any explicit bias mitigation techniques were used during data preprocessing.
