The provided context does not contain information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of the XGBoost algorithm for land use/land cover classification and forest types accuracy assessment. XGBoost is a decision-tree-based ensemble machine learning algorithm known for its performance and versatility. It has built-in mechanisms to handle overfitting and maintain model generalizability, such as regularization and subsampling.

In addition, the authors published multiple studies using similar methodologies and datasets, allowing for comparisons and evaluations of their models' performance across different contexts. This practice can indirectly contribute to the generalizability of their models.

Another aspect of generalizability is the diversity of the dataset. The authors provide a table listing various forest types and their corresponding areas in the study site. This table indicates that the dataset includes a variety of forest types, which could help improve the model's generalizability. However, the text mentions that the study was constrained by limitations in resources and time, resulting in a narrow focus on specific forest samples. This limitation might have negatively affected the model's generalizability.

To summarize, while the provided context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the XGBoost algorithm has built-in mechanisms to handle overfitting and maintain model generalizability. The authors' practice of publishing multiple studies using similar methodologies and datasets allows for comparisons and evaluations of their models' performance across different contexts. However, the dataset's diversity might have been limited due to resource and time constraints, potentially affecting the model's generalizability.
