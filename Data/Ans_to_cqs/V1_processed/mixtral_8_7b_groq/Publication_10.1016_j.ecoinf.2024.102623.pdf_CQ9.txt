The provided context does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various aspects of deep learning models, including architectures, training methods, and applications in ecological informatics. However, it does not mention where the data used in these studies is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.

It is important to note that data repositories like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF are valuable resources for sharing and accessing scientific data. By making data publicly available, researchers can promote transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in their fields. I encourage researchers to consider using these platforms to share their data and contribute to the scientific community.
