Based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific purpose of the deep learning model used in the study. The context discusses the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Random Forests as machine learning methods for modeling net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. However, it does not specify the particular task or purpose of the deep learning model, such as classification, segmentation, or detection.

The ANN model used in the study is a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with a hidden layer. The number of neurons in the hidden layer is determined by the Fletcher-Gloss method, and the activation functions tested are not specified. The Random Forest method, which is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees, is found to be superior for modeling growth in the Atlantic Forest.

Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a precise answer to the query regarding the purpose of the deep learning model used in the study.
