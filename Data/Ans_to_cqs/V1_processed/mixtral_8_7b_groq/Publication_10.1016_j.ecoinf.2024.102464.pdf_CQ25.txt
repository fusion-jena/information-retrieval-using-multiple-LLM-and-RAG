Based on the information provided, I cannot directly determine the type of deep learning model used in the study, as it does not specify whether it is a classification, segmentation, or object detection model. However, I can provide some context about the general use of machine learning models in the study.

The main goal of the study is to assess the impact of urban development on species distribution using data from the third and fourth natural environment surveys. Seven machine learning models were employed, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), among others. These models were used to generate model input variables and a landscape matrix for landscape connectivity analysis.

The models utilized environmental variables and species data to predict species distribution. These variables include land cover, vegetation (forest type, age class, diameter, and density), terrain (Dem, Aspect, Hill Shade, Slope, and TWI), and distance (distance to water, forests, agricultural land, grassland, roads, and urban areas).

The purpose of these machine learning models is to create a species distribution model that can predict the presence of species based on the environmental variables. This information is then used to develop an Incremental Forest Management for Landscape Connectivity (IFM-LCONS) model, which considers any grid with a value above the threshold of 0.74 as an input variable (number of species observations).

While the text does not explicitly mention deep learning models, it is possible that the authors used deep learning techniques for some of the machine learning models. For instance, deep learning algorithms can be used in the Random Forest model for better feature learning and prediction accuracy. Nonetheless, without explicit confirmation in the text, I cannot definitively state that deep learning models were used, nor can I specify the type of deep learning model (classification, segmentation, or object detection).
