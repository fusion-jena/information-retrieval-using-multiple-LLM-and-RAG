Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model for river health predictions. However, the text mentions that various machine learning models, including deep learning, have been employed for river health predictions, but they lack evaluation techniques to confirm their generalizability to unseen datasets.

In general, to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, several measures can be taken, such as:

1. Diverse dataset: Using a diverse and representative dataset for training the model can help ensure that it can generalize well to unseen data. This includes collecting data from different sources, locations, and conditions to capture the variability in the data.

2. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a model by dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on one fold, and testing it on the remaining folds. This process is repeated for each fold, and the average performance is calculated. Cross-validation can help prevent overfitting and ensure that the model can generalize well to new data.

3. Stratified splitting: Stratified splitting is a technique used to divide the dataset into training and testing sets while preserving the distribution of important variables. This can help ensure that the model is exposed to the full range of variability in the data and can generalize well to unseen data.

4. Regularization: Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, can be used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. This can help ensure that the model does not rely too heavily on any one feature and can generalize well to new data.

5. Bias-variance decomposition: Bias-variance decomposition is a technique used to evaluate the generalizability of a model by decomposing the loss into bias, variance, and noise terms. This can help identify whether the model is underfitting or overfitting and adjust the model accordingly.

Overall, while the provided context does not mention specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model for river health predictions, these general measures can be employed to improve the generalizability of deep learning models in any application.
