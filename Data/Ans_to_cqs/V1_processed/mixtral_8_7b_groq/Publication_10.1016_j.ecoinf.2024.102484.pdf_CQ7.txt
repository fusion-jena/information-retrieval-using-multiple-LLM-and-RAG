The provided context does not give specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does provide information about the data collection and preprocessing for a study related to soil degradation.

The data collected includes land-use types, natural factors (such as elevation, slope, mean annual temperature, and precipitation), anthropogenic factors (population density and GDP density), and point of interests in residential areas and road and railroad. The data was collected for the years 2010-2020, with a resolution of 250m. The CEC and SOC data were directly acquired and reclassified by ArcGIS 10.8.

The preprocessing of the data includes reclassification and calculation of interactions between paired factors. The judgment criteria of the interactions between paired factors are shown in Table S1, with BE and NE representing bivariate-enhance and nonlinear-enhance, respectively.

The study has certain limitations, such as the small amount of data provided by the HWSD and the requirement of a large size of geographic samples by the geographical detector. The study suggests processing data from the Basic Soil Property Dataset of High-resolution China Soil Information Grids and HWSD jointly to improve temporal and spatial accuracy in future research on soil degradation.

In the context of deep learning model training, data splitting is an important step to evaluate the model's performance. Commonly, the data is split into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

There are different criteria to split the data, such as random splitting, stratified sampling, and clustering. Random splitting is the most common method, where the data is randomly divided into training, validation, and testing sets. Stratified sampling ensures that each set has a representative sample of the data's distribution. Clustering divides the data into clusters based on similarities and divides each cluster into training, validation, and testing sets.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not give specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it does provide information about the data collection and preprocessing. The criteria to split the data depend on the problem's nature, the data's distribution, and the deep learning model used.
