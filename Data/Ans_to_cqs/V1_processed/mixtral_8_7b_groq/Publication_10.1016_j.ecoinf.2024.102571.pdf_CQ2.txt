The provided context does not directly discuss the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention several studies that use various data formats in their research.

The Tang et al. (2022) study examines China's water pollution control over the past 20 years, but it does not specify the data format used in their analysis. Similarly, the United Nations Environment Programme (2021) report, "Making Peace with Nature," does not mention any specific data formats used in its research.

The Uzlu (2021) study uses artificial neural networks to estimate greenhouse gas emissions in Turkey. While the study does not explicitly mention the data format used, it is likely that the data was presented in a format that could be processed by the neural network, such as a CSV file.

The Van Drecht et al. (2009) study examines global nitrogen and phosphate in urban wastewater for the period 1970 to 2050. The data used in this study is likely to have been presented in a tabular format, such as a CSV file, to allow for analysis of trends over time.

The Wang et al. (2018) study investigates the effects of electro-dewatering pretreatment on nitrous oxide emission involved in related functional genes in sewage sludge composting. The data used in this study is likely to have been collected from experiments and presented in a format that could be analyzed statistically, such as a CSV file.

The Wang et al. (2019a) study examines China's CO2 peak before 2030 implied from characteristics and growth of cities. The data used in this study is likely to have been collected from various sources, such as government databases, and presented in a format that could be analyzed statistically, such as a CSV file.

The provided context also includes several tables of data, but these tables do not provide information on the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline, it is likely that tabular data formats, such as CSV files, are commonly used in such pipelines. Additionally, data formats that can be processed by neural networks, such as audio, image, and video files, may also be used depending on the specific application.
