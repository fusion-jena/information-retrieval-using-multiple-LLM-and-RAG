The provided research context discusses a deep learning framework for classifying water contamination in aquaculture, but it does not explicitly mention the data format used in their pipeline. However, based on common practices and similar studies in the field of water quality analysis, it can be inferred that the data format used is likely to be CSV or a similar structured format.

In the context, the study mentions integrating IoT (Internet of Things) devices for real-time data collection, which typically include sensors for measuring various water quality parameters such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate concentration. These sensor readings are usually stored and transmitted in a structured format, such as CSV (Comma-Separated Values), where each parameter is represented by a separate column, and each row corresponds to a specific time instance.

Moreover, the context highlights the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques for data analysis, which generally require structured data for efficient processing. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the data format used in this study is a structured format, such as CSV.

To further support this inference, other related studies mentioned in the context also use structured data formats for water quality analysis. For instance, Badrzadeh et al. (2022) analyze agricultural nonpoint source pollution discharges into rivers, while Bisht et al. (2017) develop an automated water quality classification model for the River Ganga. Both studies use structured data formats for their deep learning pipelines.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data format used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that a structured format, such as CSV, is likely used based on the description of IoT data collection and common practices in water quality analysis using machine learning and deep learning techniques.
