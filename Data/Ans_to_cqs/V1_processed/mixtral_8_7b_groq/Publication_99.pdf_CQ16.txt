The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context provided is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the training process for the classification models is completed after a fixed number of epochs, which is 20 in this case.

In addition, the performance of the models is evaluated based on various metrics such as SSIM (Structural Similarity Index Measure), PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), and classification accuracy. It can be inferred that the training process could have been stopped if there was no significant improvement in these metrics or if they started to degrade.

Furthermore, the training process for the GANs models (Pix2Pix) seems to be more challenging as depicted by the observed behavior of the models. In this case, the training process could have been stopped if the models started to show unstable behavior or if they failed to converge.

Overall, while the criteria for determining when training is complete are not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the training process is completed after a fixed number of epochs and based on the performance of the models evaluated using various metrics.
