The context does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. It is mentioned that minibatch gradient descent was used during training. The CNN was implemented using Keras, TensorFlow, and pre-trained weights from EfficientNet-B4. The training was carried out using CUDA, CuDNN, and Nvidia P100 accelerator cards. A table is presented with performance metrics, but it does not contain information about hyperparameters.
