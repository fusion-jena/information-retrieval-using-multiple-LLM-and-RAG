The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline described in the study are images and audio files.

The study focuses on the identification of 36 tropical bat species using a deep learning model. The input data for the model consists of audio files, which are converted into spectral images as part of the pipeline. These spectral images are then used as the input for the deep learning model.

The Converting\_image.py script is used to convert the audio files into spectral images. The Making\_database.py script is then used to create a database of these spectral images. Finally, the Training.py script is used to train the deep learning model using the created database of spectral images.

The study also mentions that the pipeline was tested using both filtered images and unfiltered audio files. This suggests that the pipeline can handle both pre-processed and raw audio files as input.

Therefore, the data formats used in this deep learning pipeline are primarily spectral images, which are derived from audio files. Additionally, the pipeline can handle raw audio files as input, which are converted into spectral images as part of the pipeline.
