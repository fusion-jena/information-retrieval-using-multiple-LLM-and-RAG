The provided context does not explicitly mention the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline for satellite and aerial image analysis. However, it does discuss various aspects of image data collection, processing, and curation in the context of ecological studies.

In the context of deep learning, popular datasets used for image classification tasks include MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) for handwritten digit recognition, CIFAR (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research) for object recognition, and ImageNet for large-scale object recognition. These datasets are widely used for benchmarking and developing image classification models.

However, the context provided seems to focus on the use of image data in ecological studies, such as coral reef monitoring and deep-sea observation. In such studies, the datasets used would likely consist of satellite or aerial images specifically related to the ecological features being studied. These datasets may not be publicly available or as widely used as the aforementioned benchmarking datasets.

In the context of ecological image data, the following metadata fields are mentioned as important for documentation and curation:

* Image and derived data curation protocol
* Image annotation QAQC
* Documentation capture
* Documentation processing
* Documentation versions
* Publications

These fields highlight the importance of proper data management and documentation in ecological studies.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline for satellite and aerial image analysis, it does emphasize the importance of proper data management and documentation in ecological studies using image data. The commonly used datasets in deep learning for image classification tasks are MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet.
