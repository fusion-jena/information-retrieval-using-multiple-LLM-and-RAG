The provided context discusses various models and techniques used in deep learning for image classification, but it does not explicitly mention data annotation techniques. However, I can provide some common data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for tasks such as object detection and segmentation.

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in an image. These boxes, also known as bounding boxes, provide the coordinates of the object's location, making it easier for deep learning models to identify and classify objects.

2. Instance segmentation: This method involves labeling each pixel in an image to assign it to a specific instance of an object. Unlike semantic segmentation, which categorizes pixels based on object classes without distinguishing between individual objects, instance segmentation can identify and differentiate multiple instances of the same object class within an image.

3. Pixel-level annotation: Similar to instance segmentation, pixel-level annotation involves labeling each pixel in an image. However, this technique does not differentiate between instances of objects. Instead, it assigns a class label to every pixel, creating a pixel-wise classification map for the image.

4. Scribble-based annotation: This is a more relaxed annotation technique where users provide rough scribbles or strokes over objects of interest. Deep learning models can then learn to segment objects based on these scribbles, reducing the annotation effort compared to pixel-level annotation.

5. Landmark annotation: In this technique, key points or landmarks are identified and annotated on objects within an image. These annotations can be used for tasks such as facial recognition, human pose estimation, or object tracking.

6. Lines and polygons: For specific use cases, such as road or lane detection, annotators may use lines or polygons to outline regions of interest.

These annotation techniques help create labeled datasets that can be used to train deep learning models for various computer vision tasks, including image classification.
