Based on the provided context, no specific data augmentation techniques are mentioned as having been applied in the described deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to increase the amount and variability of training data, and it often involves transformations such as flipping, rotating, and scaling. However, the context focuses mainly on the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and the process of splitting images into tiles to match the size of the training samples. It does not provide information on any data augmentation techniques that may have been used. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
