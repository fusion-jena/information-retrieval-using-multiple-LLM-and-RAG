Based on the provided context, there is no mention of any of the typical deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the text discusses the use of various datasets in the context of ecological modeling and machine learning.

The datasets mentioned in the text include:

1. Simulated Dataset in Matthiopoulos et al. (2015) - This dataset was simulated from multiple instances, each consisting of 500 observations representing a sub-population in a different landscape. It has a spatial structure based on these scenarios.
2. Simulated Dataset in Matthiopoulos et al. (2011) - The specifics of this dataset are not provided in the text.
3. Sparrow population dataset - This dataset is used to compare the performance of various models, including the RBF-GFR and GFR models with CART methods, as well as ensemble approaches such as random forests (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost).
4. Wolf population dataset - This dataset is also used to compare the performance of various models, but the specifics of the dataset are not provided in the text.

The text mentions that these datasets have spatial structures and that the block cross-validation approach is used to account for the autocorrelation of dataset structures. However, there is no mention of any deep learning techniques or datasets commonly used in deep learning applications.
