The specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is stated that "The link to the data is shared in the manuscript." Therefore, I would recommend checking the manuscript for the data repository link.

Additionally, the CRediT authorship contribution statement mentions that Curt Jenner and Micheline N. Jenner contributed to "Data curation," which suggests that they may have played a role in preparing and managing the data used in the study. It is possible that the data repository is associated with their work.

The study was published in Ecological Informatics, and the journal may have its own data availability policies or guidelines. It may be worth checking the journal's website or contacting the editors to inquire about the data repository.

Finally, the study was supported by funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Canadian Foundation for Innovation (CFI), and the Canada Research Chairs program. These organizations may have data sharing requirements or policies that the authors followed. It may be helpful to check their websites for more information on data availability.

In summary, while the specific data repository is not mentioned in the provided context, there are several potential leads to follow up on, including checking the manuscript, contacting the authors or journal editors, and looking into the funding organizations' data policies.
