Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, in the context of machine learning and evaluating spatiotemporal models using satellite data over large regions, Just et al. (2020) mentioned some data preprocessing steps that are generally applicable to various machine learning algorithms, including deep learning.

Firstly, data normalization or scaling is a common preprocessing step in machine learning. In the context, the authors used the standardization technique, which involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation for each feature. This technique ensures that all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which can help the model converge faster during training and improve its performance.

Secondly, data cleaning is an essential preprocessing step in machine learning. In the context, Just et al. (2020) mentioned removing outliers and missing values from the dataset. Outliers can significantly affect the model's performance, while missing values can lead to a loss of information and reduce the model's accuracy. Therefore, it is crucial to clean the data before training the model.

Lastly, the authors used cross-validation, a resampling method, to assess the accuracy of the final model. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into training and validation sets, fitting the model on the training set, and evaluating its performance on the validation set. This process is repeated several times, and the average performance is reported. Cross-validation helps to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model performs well on the training set but poorly on new, unseen data.

In summary, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include data normalization or scaling, data cleaning, and cross-validation. These steps help to improve the model's performance, prevent overfitting, and ensure that the model generalizes well to new data. However, it is important to note that the specific preprocessing steps may vary depending on the dataset and the problem at hand.
