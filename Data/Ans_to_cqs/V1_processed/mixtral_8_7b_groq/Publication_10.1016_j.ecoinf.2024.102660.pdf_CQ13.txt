The deep learning model, Res\_AUNet, was constructed using the PyTorch library and trained on a Dell workstation with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6248R CPU, 512GB of memory, and an NVIDIA RTX A6000 graphics card with 48GB of memory. During the training process, the input images underwent random rotations, flips, and other image augmentation operations to enhance the network's robustness.

The Res\_AUNet network was trained for 120 epochs with a batch size of 8. The initial learning rate was set to 0.001, and it was adjusted using the equal-interval adjustment strategy (StepLR), which halved the original rate every 10 epochs of iteration. However, the specific type of optimizer used in the model is not mentioned in the provided context.

Additionally, the input images were cropped to a size of 256 Ã— 256 pixels, resulting in a total of 1764 image pairs. Among them, 1232 image pairs were used for training the deep neural network, 176 image pairs for validating the model accuracy during the training phase, and 356 image pairs for testing the performance of the trained network post-training.

Therefore, the hyperparameters used in the Res\_AUNet deep learning model include a batch size of 8, an initial learning rate of 0.001, and 120 epochs of training with the learning rate adjusted every 10 epochs. However, the type of optimizer used in the model is not specified in the given context.
