The text provided gives information on the use of data augmentation techniques in a deep learning pipeline, specifically in the training of the AIP-OD model. However, it does not mention rotation as a data augmentation method used in this particular study. The following data augmentation techniques were applied:

1. Random adjustments to image size: The training dataset images had their sizes randomly adjusted during training. This technique helps the model generalize better, as it is exposed to different image scales.

2. Image flipping: The images in the training dataset were flipped horizontally to create new training samples. Flipping images horizontally helps the model learn features that are not dependent on the left-right orientation of objects in the image.

3. Cropping: Some parts of the images in the training dataset were cropped to create new training samples. Cropping helps the model learn features from different regions of the images and improves its ability to handle objects at different positions within the image frame.

4. Conversion: The text does not provide specific details about the conversion technique. It could refer to color space conversion (e.g., RGB to grayscale) or format conversion (e.g., JPEG to PNG). Regardless of the exact conversion method, this technique helps the model learn to handle a variety of image types and color representations.

In summary, the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline described in the text include random adjustments to image size, image flipping, cropping, and conversion. These techniques help improve the model's performance by increasing its exposure to diverse image representations during training.
