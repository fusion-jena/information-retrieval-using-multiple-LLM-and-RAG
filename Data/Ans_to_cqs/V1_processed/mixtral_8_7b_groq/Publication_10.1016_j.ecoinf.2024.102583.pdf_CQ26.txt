The provided context discusses various techniques used to improve the performance of machine learning models, including ensemble methods to mitigate overfitting. However, it does not directly address the query about data bias reduction techniques during the preprocessing of deep learning pipelines.

Nevertheless, I can provide some common techniques used to address data bias in machine learning and deep learning:

1. **Stratified sampling**: During the splitting of data into training, validation, and testing sets, stratified sampling ensures that each subset maintains the original dataset's distribution of classes. This method is useful when the dataset is imbalanced.

2. **Oversampling**: In oversampling, the minority class instances are replicated to balance the dataset. This technique can help the model learn the minority class better, reducing bias. However, it can lead to overfitting if not done carefully.

3. **Undersampling**: Undersampling involves reducing the majority class instances to balance the dataset. This method can help prevent overfitting due to oversampling but may result in loss of valuable information.

4. **Synthetic data generation**: Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) generate synthetic instances for the minority class based on the existing data. This method can help balance the dataset without overfitting.

5. **Diverse data collection**: Collecting data from various sources, domains, and demographics can help ensure that the dataset is representative and less biased. This method can help improve the model's generalization ability.

6. **Data augmentation**: In deep learning, data augmentation techniques like rotation, scaling, and flipping can help increase the diversity of the training dataset, reducing overfitting and bias.

While the provided context does not discuss these techniques explicitly, they are commonly used in the preprocessing stage of deep learning pipelines to address data bias.
