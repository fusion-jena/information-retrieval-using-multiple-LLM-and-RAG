I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context doesn't seem to directly address the question about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. The context appears to be about a study on song variants in birds, with data analysis methods outlined in a 2012 paper.

In general, deep learning models often involve randomness during various stages, such as weight initialization, dropout, data shuffling, and batch sampling. To ensure reproducibility and mitigate the impact of randomness, deep learning practitioners may employ strategies like fixing a random seed value. This ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of random numbers in different runs, making the training process more deterministic.

However, without more context about the specific deep learning pipeline being referred to, it's difficult to provide a more precise answer. If you could provide more information or context, I'd be happy to try and give a more detailed response.
