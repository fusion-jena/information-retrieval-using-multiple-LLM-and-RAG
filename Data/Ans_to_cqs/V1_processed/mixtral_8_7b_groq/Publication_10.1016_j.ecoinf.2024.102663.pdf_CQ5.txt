In the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet) used in the deep learning pipeline for fish biomass estimation. However, it is stated that the deep learning model is trained on large datasets of fish images. These datasets are likely to be specific to the fish species and environments studied in the research. They might include various turbid environments, different fish sizes, and various factors affecting fish biomass. The datasets could be collected through underwater films, cameras, or other image-capturing methods. Preprocessing techniques like the MSR color correction algorithm might be applied to enhance the image quality before using them for training.
