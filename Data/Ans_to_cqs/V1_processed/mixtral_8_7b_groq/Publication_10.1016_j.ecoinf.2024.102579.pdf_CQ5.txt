I'm sorry for any confusion, but the context provided does not seem to pertain to the query regarding datasets used in deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to be about a survey conducted in 2017, involving the use of plot data and the development of estimators (inventory, NN1, and NN2) for continuous cover in forestry or ecological informatics. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to the query based on the given context.
