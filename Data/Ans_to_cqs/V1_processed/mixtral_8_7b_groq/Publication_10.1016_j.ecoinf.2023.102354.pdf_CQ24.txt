The provided context discusses the use of deep learning and machine learning algorithms for enhancing groundwater-climate interactions understanding, specifically in the sub-basins of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) region. It mentions the use of the southeast region of the GAB as an example and the spatial distributions of Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at different aggregation scales (3, 6, and 12 months). However, it does not explicitly mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, deep learning models often involve randomness during various stages, such as weight initialization, dropout, data shuffling, and batch sampling. Here are some common strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline:

1. Fixed random seed value: To ensure reproducibility, a fixed random seed value is set before the start of the training process. This ensures that the same initial weights are used during each training run, and the same data samples are selected for each batch and epoch.
2. Data augmentation: Random data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping, are used to increase the size of the training dataset and reduce overfitting.
3. Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out a fraction of the neurons during training. This helps prevent overfitting and improves the generalization of the model.
4. Batch normalization: Batch normalization normalizes the inputs of each batch, reducing the internal covariate shift and improving the stability of the model.
5. Early stopping: Early stopping is a technique that stops the training process when the validation loss stops improving. This helps prevent overfitting and saves training time.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, the above-mentioned strategies are commonly used in deep learning to handle randomness.
