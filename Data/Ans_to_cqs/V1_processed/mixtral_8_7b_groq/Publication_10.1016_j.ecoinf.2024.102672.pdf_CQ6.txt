Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the data used in this study has already been processed to some extent, as the number of epochs during training was maintained at 500 to guarantee the stabilization of the loss curves. This suggests that the data was previously explored and prepared for training.

In general, for deep learning models, data preprocessing may include several steps, such as:

1. Data cleaning: This step involves handling missing or corrupted data points, removing outliers, and dealing with duplicate entries.

2. Data normalization or scaling: Deep learning models, especially those using gradient-based optimization algorithms, can be sensitive to the scale of the input features. Therefore, it is common to normalize or scale the data to a similar range, for example, by using min-max scaling or z-score normalization.

3. Feature engineering: Depending on the problem and the data, it might be beneficial to create new features or transform existing ones. This can help the model capture underlying patterns or relationships in the data.

4. Data splitting: The data is usually split into training, validation, and test sets. This allows for evaluating the model's performance and tuning hyperparameters while preventing overfitting.

Although the provided context does not mention these specific preprocessing steps, it is essential to perform these tasks to ensure the model's performance and the quality of the results.
