The data used in this study is a set of 23,904 training datacubes, which are located across Europe and were provided as part of the EarthNet2021 Challenge. The datacubes contain topography information for past, present, and future time steps, and are used as model inputs.

For the purpose of training the deep learning model, the datacubes are split into several sets. The first set is used for model training, while the remaining four sets are used for testing. The specific criteria used to split the data into these sets is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the data splitting criteria were defined by EarthNet2021 (see Section 2.5).

Additionally, during the model training process, the data is further divided into training and validation sets. The validation set is used to evaluate the performance of the model at each epoch, and the training set is used to train the model. The optimization of the model is stopped once the validation score repeatedly fails to improve compared to the score from previous epochs. The model at the epoch with the highest attained validation score is then selected as the final model.

In summary, the datacubes are split into a training set and four testing sets, with the specific criteria for splitting the data being defined by EarthNet2021. During model training, the data is further divided into training and validation sets, with the validation set used to evaluate the model's performance and the training set used to train the model.
