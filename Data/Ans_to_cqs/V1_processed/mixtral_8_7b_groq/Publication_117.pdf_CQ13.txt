The provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the YOLO DCNN (Darknet Convolutional Neural Network) was used, and the model was trained using pretrained weights from the COCO dataset provided by Redmon & Farhadi (2018).

The YOLO (You Only Look Once) model has several hyperparameters that can be tuned, such as the learning rate, the optimizer, the batch size, and the number of epochs. The optimizer could be any standard optimization algorithm, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, or Adam. The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of the loss function. The batch size is the number of training examples used in one iteration, and the number of epochs is the number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.

However, the specific values of these hyperparameters used in the study described in the context are not provided. Therefore, it is not possible to give a precise answer to this query without additional information.
