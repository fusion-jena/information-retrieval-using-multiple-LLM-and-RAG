The provided context does not specify where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. It mentions the use of data collected at Pelican Mountain (PM), Calling Lake (CL), and Conklin (CK) for training, testing, and validating the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) semantic segmentation algorithm. However, it does not provide information on where this data can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional context.
