The provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention that the model used is AlexNet, which is a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. AlexNet was originally trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains over 1 million images belonging to 1000 classes.

The hyperparameters used during the training of AlexNet on ImageNet are well-documented in the original paper by Krizhevsky et al. (2012). They used a learning rate of 0.01, a momentum of 0.9, and a weight decay of 0.0005. The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm was used as the optimizer.

However, it is important to note that the context specifically mentions that the AlexNet model was used as a base model for their study, and it is not clear if the hyperparameters were kept the same or modified for the specific task at hand. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.

In addition, the context also discusses the use of different training modes, such as zero-start training and incremental training, and different computing platforms, such as a GPU server and a desktop PC. However, these factors do not directly relate to the hyperparameters of the deep learning model.

In summary, while the context provides information about the deep learning model used in the study, it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used. The original AlexNet model was trained using a learning rate of 0.01, a momentum of 0.9, a weight decay of 0.0005, and the SGD optimizer. However, it is not clear if these hyperparameters were used in the study described in the context.
