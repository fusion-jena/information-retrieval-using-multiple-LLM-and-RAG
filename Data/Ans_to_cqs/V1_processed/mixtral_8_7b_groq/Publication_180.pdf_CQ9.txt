Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used for automated Chagas disease vector identification. It is possible that the data repository is not publicly available or was not specified in the given text.

However, the context does mention that the study used TensorFlow, an open-source software platform for deep learning research and applications. The study also used a dataset of Triatominae, which are insects that transmit Chagas disease. The dataset was likely adapted and configured for use in the project, but the original source of the data is not mentioned.

In general, data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF provide a way to share and preserve research data. These repositories allow researchers to make their data publicly available, which can increase transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in research.

Therefore, it is possible that the data repository for this study is located on one of these platforms. However, without more information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer. If the data repository is not mentioned in the study, it may be helpful to contact the authors directly to inquire about the availability and location of the data.
