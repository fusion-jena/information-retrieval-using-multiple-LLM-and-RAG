The text provided discusses one particular method used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline, which is related to the choice of patch size when extracting features from images. Specifically, it is mentioned that a patch size of 224 Ã— 224 pixels performed the best out of the metrics tested, as it included enough contextual noise to regularize overfitting and enabled better generalization. This suggests that the choice of patch size can act as a form of regularization, as a larger patch size introduces more contextual noise which can help to prevent overfitting.

However, the text does not explicitly mention other common regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons. L2 regularization, on the other hand, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, which can help to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.

Therefore, while the text does mention one form of regularization related to the choice of patch size, it does not provide information on other common regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.
