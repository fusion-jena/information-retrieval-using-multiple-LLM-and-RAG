The provided context does not include information about the platform used to deploy the deep learning models. The text focuses on the comparison of different deep learning models (Adam, SGDM, RMSProp, CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM) for Chlorophyll (Chl) dynamic forecasting in the Zhoushan fishery. It discusses the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R-squared (R2) values for these models at different input time series lengths (3 days and 7 days) and three concentration regions (A, B, and C). However, there is no mention of the cloud platform or any other deployment platform used for these models.
