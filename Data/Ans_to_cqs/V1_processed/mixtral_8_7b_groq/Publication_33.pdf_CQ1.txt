The specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline described in the scientific report are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that the deep learning algorithms (DLAs) are used to automatically identify organisms on images, which suggests that the raw data consists of images. These images are obtained from underwater surveys using high-definition videos recorded at various depths, luminosities, and environmental conditions. The videos are recorded using GoPro Hero 3 + black and Hero 4 + black cameras, and the images are extracted from these videos. It appears that the researchers decided to build their own dataset using these videos instead of using existing datasets. Therefore, the data collection in this study involves underwater surveys using high-definition video recordings.
