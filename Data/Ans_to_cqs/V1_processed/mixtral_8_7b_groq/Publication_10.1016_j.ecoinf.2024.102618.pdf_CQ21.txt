The postprocessing steps involved after the model training, as described in the given context, include the calculation of performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, as well as the generation of a confusion matrix.

According to section 3.7 of the text, the accuracy of the deep-learning models is measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall. Accuracy is a simple metric that measures the overall percentage of correct predictions. Precision, on the other hand, measures the number of positive predictions that are actually correct, while recall measures the number of positive predictions that are correctly identified by the model.

Additionally, the context provides information on the generation of a confusion matrix. A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It shows the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model for each class. Specifically, the diagonal cells of the confusion matrix represent the number of correct classifications, while the off-diagonal cells represent the number of misclassifications.

In the given context, a confusion matrix is presented for the classification of plant diseases by the ensemble model and by the EfficientNetB3 model (see Figures 4 and 5). The confusion matrix for the EfficientNetB3 model shows that the model misclassified class 19 as class 22 and 23 a total of 23 times. However, this classification error is removed with ensemble modeling, as shown in the confusion matrix of the ensemble model, which has a smaller number of misclassifications compared to the EfficientNetB3 model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, as well as the generation of a confusion matrix.
