The provided context does not give specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a neural network for classifying hummingbird visitation events in time-lapse camera trap images.

In general, data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for image classification tasks. These techniques help increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, which can improve the model's ability to generalize and reduce overfitting.

For example, in the context of classifying hummingbird visitation events, data augmentation techniques could include:

* Flipping: Horizontally flipping images to increase the number of training examples and help the model generalize better to different camera angles.
* Rotating: Rotating images to simulate different orientations of the camera trap and help the model learn to recognize hummingbirds in different positions.
* Scaling: Resizing images to simulate different distances between the camera trap and the hummingbirds, which can help the model learn to recognize hummingbirds at different scales.

It's possible that the authors of the study used some or all of these data augmentation techniques in their deep learning pipeline, but without more information, it's impossible to say for sure.
