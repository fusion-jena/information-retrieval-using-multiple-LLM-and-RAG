The provided context does not give information about the specific deep learning pipeline or the datasets used in it, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does provide details about several datasets used in an ecological informatics study.

These datasets include:

1. DEM (Digital Elevation Model) with a spatial resolution of 30 meters, obtained from ASTER GDEM (http://www.gscloud.cn).
2. Land use data as raster data with a spatial resolution of 30 meters, sourced from the Resource and Environment Science and Data Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences (https://www.resdc.cn/DOI/DOI.aspx?DOIID=54).
3. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) as raster data with a spatial resolution of 1 km, obtained from the National Cryosphere Desert Data Center (https://www.escience.org.cn/metadata).
4. Soil data as raster data with a spatial resolution of 1 km, sourced from the National Cryosphere Desert Data Center (https://www.escience.org.cn/metadata).
5. Population data as raster data with a spatial resolution of 1 km, obtained from the Resource and Environment Science and Data Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences (https://www.resdc.cn/DOI/DOI.aspx?DOIID=32).
6. GDP (Gross Domestic Product) data as raster data with a spatial resolution of 1 km, sourced from the Resource and Environment Science and Data Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences (https://www.resdc.cn/DOI/DOI.aspx?DOIID=33).
7. Meteorological data as raster data with a spatial resolution of 1 km, obtained from the Resource and Environment Science and Data Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences (https://www.resdc.cn/DOI/DOI.aspx?DOIID=96).
8. Vector data, obtained from the National Catalog Service for Geographic Information (https://www.webmap.cn/main.do?method=index).
9. Statistical data from the Gansu Province Bureau of Statistics, Shaanxi Province Bureau of Statistics, and Ningxia Province Bureau of Statistics (https://tjj.gsu.gov.cn/).

While these datasets are not directly related to deep learning pipelines like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, they are used in the context of ecological informatics and spatial data analysis.
