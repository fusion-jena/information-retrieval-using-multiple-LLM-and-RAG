The training of the landuse classification models is determined to be complete when the validation loss plateaus. This is evident in Figure 6 of the provided context, which illustrates the learning curves of the five networks. The thinner lines in the figure represent the training set, while the thicker lines represent the validation set. The blue curves represent loss, and the red curves represent accuracy. 

In the learning curves, it can be observed that as the number of epochs increases, the training losses reduce and eventually converge. The Inceptionv3 model converges by 400 epochs, while the other networks converge within 150 epochs. The ResNet architecture, particularly ResNet50 and ResNet101, outperforms the other models. 

The validation set is used to assess the model accuracy continuously during training. The performance of the testing set guides the final decision. The model with the best performance, determined based on performance metrics, is employed to predict the rural landscape classifications in the study area. 

Therefore, it can be inferred that the validation loss plateau is used as a criterion to determine when the training of the landuse classification models is complete.
