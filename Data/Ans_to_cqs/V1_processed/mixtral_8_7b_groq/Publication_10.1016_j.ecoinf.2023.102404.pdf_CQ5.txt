The pieces of context provided do not directly mention the specific datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet) used in deep learning pipelines. However, they do provide information about various studies that have used remote sensing and LiDAR data for different applications in the field of geospatial analysis and vegetation monitoring.

For instance, Tang et al., (2022) used GEDI and ICESat-2 data for canopy height mapping of China's forests. Ma et al., (2019) conducted a meta-analysis and review of deep learning applications in remote sensing. Mandal et al., (2020) developed a dual polarimetric radar vegetation index for crop growth monitoring using Sentinel-1 SAR data. Leite et al., (2022) characterized fuel load in tropical savanna using GEDI Spaceborne Lidar data. Li et al., (2013) used multi-temporal Landsat TM images for forest classification and change analysis.

These studies used various remote sensing and LiDAR datasets specific to their research questions. However, they do not mention using standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. These standard datasets are commonly used for training and testing deep learning models in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot specifically answer the query about the deep learning datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is important to note that deep learning models can be trained and tested using various datasets, depending on the specific application and research question.
