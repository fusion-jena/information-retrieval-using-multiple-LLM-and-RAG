The type of deep learning model used in the described pipeline is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which is a type of feedforward neural network. The MLP architecture consists of four layers, each containing 512 neurons and connected with residual connections. Batch normalization and the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function are employed in all layers except the final one, where a sigmoid function is used instead to enable multi-label classification. The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer with a batch size of 256 for 30 epochs, and both weight decay and the learning rate are set to 0.0001. Additionally, a learning rate scheduler with exponential decay of 0.95 and dropout are introduced to prevent overfitting.
