The provided context does not give information about a deep learning pipeline but rather focuses on the use of the Kaleidoscope Pro software for analyzing acoustic data of the Nighthawk. The data format used in this case is audio, as the software is used to analyze sound recordings of the Nighthawk.

The Kaleidoscope Pro software extracts sounds of interest based on five parameters, including minimum and maximum signal length, minimum and maximum frequency range, and maximum intersyllable gap. These parameters are characterized from spectrograms using Raven Pro 1.5.

The study analyzed 67 songs of the Nighthawk using all recordings uploaded in Xeno-canto and recorded in the State of Mato Grosso, which amounted to eight recordings. The signal parameters introduced in Kaleidoscope were: 900 and 1500 Hz (minimum and maximum frequency, respectively); 4 and 30 s (minimum and maximum signal length, respectively); and a maximum intersyllable gap of 4 s.

Therefore, the data format used in this study is audio, and the Kaleidoscope Pro software is used to analyze the sound recordings based on specific signal parameters.
