The context provided does not specify the particular deep learning framework used for building the models EfficientNetV2B0, ResNet-18, or ResNet-50. However, it does mention that these models were run on TensorFlow Lite, which is an optimized version of TensorFlow for edge devices. Therefore, it can be inferred that the models were initially built using TensorFlow, and then converted to TensorFlow Lite for deployment on the edge device. As for other popular deep learning frameworks, PyTorch is not mentioned in the context.

Moreover, the context also discusses the use of neural architecture search (NAS) for developing the EfficientNetV2B0 model. NAS is a technique for automating the design of neural network architectures, and can be implemented using various frameworks, including TensorFlow and PyTorch. Therefore, it is possible that EfficientNetV2B0 was built using either of these frameworks, but the context does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion.

In summary, while the context indicates that TensorFlow was used for building the models and converting them to TensorFlow Lite for deployment on the edge device, it does not explicitly specify the initial deep learning framework used for building the models.
