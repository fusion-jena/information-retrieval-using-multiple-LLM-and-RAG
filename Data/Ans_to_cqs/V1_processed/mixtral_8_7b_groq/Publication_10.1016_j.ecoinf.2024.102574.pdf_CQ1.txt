In the deep learning pipeline for ecological applications, various methods are utilized for collecting raw data, including field surveys, remote sensing sensors, and public datasets.

Field surveys are a common method for data collection in ecological studies. These surveys can involve direct measurements of vegetation, soil, and other environmental factors. For instance, the study by Tong et al. (2020) conducted a field survey to investigate a plot in southern China, collecting data on forest management and carbon sequestration. Similarly, Viana et al. (2012) used forest inventory data to estimate crown biomass of Pinus pinaster stands and shrubland above-ground biomass.

Remote sensing sensors, such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), are increasingly being used for data collection in ecological studies. LiDAR uses laser pulses to measure the distance between the sensor and the target, providing high-resolution 3D point clouds of vegetation and terrain. Qin et al. (2022) used UAV-based LiDAR to segment individual trees and classify tree species in subtropical broadleaf forests. Torresani et al. (2023) utilized LiDAR data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) to derive tree canopy height heterogeneity and reveal patterns of biodiversity in forest ecosystems.

UAVs are another remote sensing tool used for data collection in ecological studies. UAVs can be equipped with various sensors, such as cameras and multispectral sensors, to collect high-resolution imagery and spectral data. For example, Javernick et al. (2014) used structure-from-motion photogrammetry with UAVs to model the topography of shallow braided rivers.

Public datasets are also a valuable resource for raw data in ecological deep learning applications. These datasets can include remote sensing data, such as satellite imagery and LiDAR data, as well as field survey data. For instance, the studies by Piao et al. (2009) and Jian et al. (2015) used public datasets to analyze the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems in China and the effects of vegetation restoration on soil water storage and water balance in the Chinese Loess Plateau, respectively.

However, it's important to note that data collection methods can introduce uncertainties and errors in the raw data. For example, wind speed can impact the accuracy of aerial surveying (Santos Santana et al., 2021; Tomaˇstík et al., 2019), and uncertainties can arise in generating point cloud data from image processing due to factors like the performance of ground point classification and interpolation algorithms (Carrera-Hern´andez et al., 2020; Jakovljevic et al., 2019). Therefore, it's crucial to consider the potential sources of error and uncertainty in the data collection methods when developing and applying deep learning models in ecological studies.

In summary, various methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for ecological applications, including field surveys, remote sensing sensors such as LiDAR and UAVs, and public datasets. However, it's important to consider the potential sources of error and uncertainty in the data collection methods when developing and applying deep learning models in ecological studies.
