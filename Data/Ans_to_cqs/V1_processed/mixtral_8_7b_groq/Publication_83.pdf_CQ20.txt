The context does not provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions the use of a VGG-style network, Adam optimizer, categorical cross entropy loss function, and a batch size of 64 samples, but it does not specify the hardware used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
