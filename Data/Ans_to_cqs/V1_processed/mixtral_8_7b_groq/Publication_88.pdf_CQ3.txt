Based on the provided context, the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that some form of image labeling or classification was used to distinguish between deforestation and no-deforestation classes in the Amazon and Cerrado databases.

The Amazon database has tiles with available definition samples (deforestation) and available no-definition samples (no-deforestation) in the training, validation, and test sets. Similarly, the Cerrado database has tiles with available definition samples (deforestation) and available no-definition samples (no-deforestation) in the training, validation, and test sets. These samples were used to train the EF and SN models.

Additionally, the context mentions that the buffer of both references was obtained by applying morphological dilation using a disk of radius 2. This operation expanded the boundaries of the deforested polygons. Then, a difference between the dilated and original images was performed, resulting in the outer edge, and the patches with the central pixel in these regions were not considered for training, validation, or test. This suggests that some form of image segmentation or polygon labeling was used to identify the deforested areas.

However, the context does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, a definitive answer cannot be given based on the provided information.
