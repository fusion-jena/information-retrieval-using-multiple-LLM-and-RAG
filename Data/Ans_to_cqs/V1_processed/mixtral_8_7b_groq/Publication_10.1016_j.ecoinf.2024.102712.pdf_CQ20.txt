Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that Sentinel-2 spectral data and field data are used to create a regression model estimating Aboveground Biomass Density (AGBD). This model is then used in the context of NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar mission.

It can be inferred that the model training process likely involves the use of high-performance computing resources, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), given the complexity of processing large volumes of remote sensing data and the computationally intensive nature of training machine learning models. However, the specific hardware resources are not specified in the context.
