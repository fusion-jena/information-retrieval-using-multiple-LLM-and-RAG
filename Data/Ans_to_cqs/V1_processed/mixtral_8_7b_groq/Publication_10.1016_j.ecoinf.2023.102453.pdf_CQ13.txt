In the context provided, the hyperparameters mentioned for a deep learning model are the learning rate, batch size, and dropout. The learning rate is a critical hyperparameter that determines how quickly the model tries to converge during training. If the learning rate is too low, the model may settle for an erroneous value, while a higher than required value would not only take a long time but would also not result in an optimal value.

The batch size is another hyperparameter that determines the model's performance. It is the number of training examples used in one iteration of the learning algorithm. A smaller batch size allows the model to learn more from individual examples, while a larger batch size can lead to more stable learning and better parallelization.

Dropout is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. It involves randomly dropping out, or "turning off," neurons during training, which helps to prevent the model from relying too heavily on any one neuron.

The context also mentions the use of Hyperband and Bayesian Optimization techniques for hyperparameter tuning. Hyperband is a bandit-based approach for hyperparameter optimization that can save significant computation time by focusing on the most promising configurations. Bayesian Optimization, on the other hand, is a sequential model-based optimization technique that uses a probabilistic model to guide the search for the optimal hyperparameter values.

In summary, the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model include the learning rate, batch size, and dropout, among others. Hyperparameter tuning is an essential step in deep learning model development, and techniques such as Hyperband and Bayesian Optimization can help to find the optimal hyperparameter values efficiently.
