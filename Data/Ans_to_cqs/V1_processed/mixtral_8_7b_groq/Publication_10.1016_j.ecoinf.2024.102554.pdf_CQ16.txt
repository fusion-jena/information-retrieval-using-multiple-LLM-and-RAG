Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The text focuses on the analysis of satellite data and does not mention any machine learning training process.

However, in the context of machine learning and training criteria, a validation loss plateau typically indicates that the model has learned enough from the training data and that further training might lead to overfitting. To determine when training is complete, one can monitor the loss function (e.g., mean squared error, cross-entropy) on a validation set during the training process. If the loss function value does not decrease significantly for a certain number of epochs, it suggests that the model has reached a plateau, and training can be stopped.

In the context of the provided text, one could infer that the data analysis and processing might be part of a machine learning pipeline. If so, the criteria for determining training completion could be similar to those mentioned above. However, without explicit information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
