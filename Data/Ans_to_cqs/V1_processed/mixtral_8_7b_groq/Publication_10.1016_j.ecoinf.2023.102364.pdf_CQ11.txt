The provided context does not include a direct link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. However, it does mention that the data used in the study is shared open access, and provides a link to a Google Drive file containing the data and methodology.

The link to the data is: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VaF7LOBTwUdLZuSs1qYZKV9MZ3j18SoN/view?usp=drive_link>

It is important to note that the study used an ensemble of machine learning models, including RandomForest, Treenet, CART, and MARS, and not specifically a deep learning pipeline. The models were trained, tested, and evaluated on a GIS platform with 68 open-access predictor layers, including socio-economic US Census data.

The data provided in the link includes project GIS files, ISO-compliant metadata, and gull survey data with individual ISO-compliant metadata per survey. The survey data includes information such as distance to railway, vegetation name, soil type, US Census 2000 (60 attributes), and Forest Layer Tanana Valley State Forest.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not include a direct link to a data repository for a deep learning pipeline, it does provide a link to the data and methodology used in the study, which includes an ensemble of machine learning models trained, tested, and evaluated on a GIS platform with open-access predictor layers.
