The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the given context are not explicitly stated. However, based on the provided information, we can infer that some of the common metrics for evaluating object detection and semantic segmentation models are likely used.

The model in question is a Mask R-CNN, which is a popular deep learning architecture for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Mask R-CNN consists of two main components: a region proposal network (RPN) and a Fast R-CNN. The RPN proposes bounding boxes around objects in the input image, and the Fast R-CNN classifies these proposals and refines their bounding boxes. Additionally, Mask R-CNN generates a binary mask for each object, indicating its pixel-wise segmentation.

In the context, the loss values for training and validation datasets during Mask R-CNN training for epoch 20 are provided. These loss values include rpn_class_loss, rpn_bbox_loss, mrcnn_class_loss, mrcnn_bbox_loss, and mrcnn_mask_loss. These losses are related to the classification and regression tasks in Mask R-CNN.

The rpn_class_loss measures the classification error of the RPN, while the rpn_bbox_loss measures the regression error of the RPN. The mrcnn_class_loss measures the classification error of the Fast R-CNN, and the mrcnn_bbox_loss measures the regression error of the Fast R-CNN. The mrcnn_mask_loss measures the binary cross-entropy loss for the mask prediction.

While these loss values are not direct performance metrics, they can be used to infer some performance metrics. For example, a lower mrcnn_mask_loss indicates better mask prediction accuracy. Similarly, lower rpn_class_loss and mrcnn_class_loss values indicate better object classification accuracy.

However, to get a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance, other metrics such as precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP) are typically used. Precision measures the proportion of true positive detections among all positive detections, while recall measures the proportion of true positive detections among all actual objects. Mean average precision (mAP) is a common metric for evaluating object detection models and measures the average precision at different intersection over union (IoU) thresholds.

Unfortunately, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine if these metrics were used to evaluate the model's performance.
