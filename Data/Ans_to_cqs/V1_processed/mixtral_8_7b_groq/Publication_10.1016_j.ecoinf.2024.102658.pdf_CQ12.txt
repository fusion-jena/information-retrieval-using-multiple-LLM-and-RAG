The provided text does not mention the use of any type of deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers in the described pipeline. The models mentioned in the text are Bayesian logistic regression, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) logistic regression, Bayesian Generalized Additive Model (GAM), and Random Forest, which are machine learning models but not deep learning models. Therefore, based on the given context, it can be stated that no deep learning models are used in the described pipeline.
