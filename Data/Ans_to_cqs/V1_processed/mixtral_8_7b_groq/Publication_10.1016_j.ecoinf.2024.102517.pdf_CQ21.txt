Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about specific postprocessing steps such as saliency map computation, metric calculation, or confusion matrix construction. The text focuses primarily on the model architecture and training procedure.

However, it is possible to infer some potential postprocessing steps from the context:

1. **Signal Processing:** After training the noise reduction network, the model can be applied to noisy bird sound signals to obtain denoised outputs. This would involve feeding noisy bird sound signals into the model and obtaining the corresponding cleaned signals as output.

2. **Evaluation Metrics:** The text mentions that the model with the shortest noise reduction time among the algorithms assessed in the study was chosen. This implies that some form of evaluation metric was used to compare the performance of different models. Common evaluation metrics for denoising tasks include Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ), and Segmental Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SegSNR).

3. **Confusion Matrix (optional):** If the model's performance is evaluated in a classification context (e.g., distinguishing different bird species), a confusion matrix could be constructed to assess the accuracy of the model. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the number of correct and incorrect classifications made by a model.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention specific postprocessing steps, it is possible to infer that some form of signal processing, evaluation metrics calculation, and potentially confusion matrix construction could be involved in the postprocessing phase.
