Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline for the Dive Reporter app. The context mainly focuses on the app's features, its use in crowdsourcing biodiversity data, and the validation of species identification. However, the app collects metadata on location, number of dives, and number of divers, which suggests the use of some form of structured data (e.g., CSV). The app does not require submission of photographic evidence, which implies that image data is not directly used in the deep learning pipeline. Given the nature of the app, which focuses on the frequency and abundance of specific marine taxa, it can be inferred that the data formats might primarily include structured data (like CSV) containing information about the sighted species, location, and other metadata. However, without more specific information, a definitive answer cannot be provided.
