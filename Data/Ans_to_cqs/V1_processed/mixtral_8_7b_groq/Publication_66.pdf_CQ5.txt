The text provided does not give information about specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, it discusses a study where deep learning models were applied to GPS track data of seabirds for predicting diving behavior. The GPS track data used in the analysis is available at seabirdtracking.org. Other data used within the analysis include GPS and dive data, and associated matrices. However, these are specific to the seabird tracking study and not general deep learning datasets. Therefore, I cannot provide the information about the specific deep learning datasets requested in the query.
