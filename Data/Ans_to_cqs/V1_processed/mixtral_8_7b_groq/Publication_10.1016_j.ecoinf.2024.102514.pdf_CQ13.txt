The provided context discusses the use of machine learning models, including some deep learning models, for predicting various outcomes. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.

Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned from the data but are set prior to training. Common hyperparameters for deep learning models include learning rate, number of layers, number of units in each layer, type of optimizer, batch size, and regularization parameters.

In the context, the authors mention using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for waste disposal rate estimation (Vu, Ng, Richter, An, 2022). However, they do not provide details on the specific hyperparameters used in the RNN model.

Another study in the context uses machine learning models, including deep learning models, to predict heavy metals in soil and pollution indices in mining areas (Wang, Zhao, Xu, 2022). Again, the authors do not provide specific details on the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models.

Therefore, while the context discusses the use of deep learning models, it does not provide enough information to answer the query regarding the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models.
