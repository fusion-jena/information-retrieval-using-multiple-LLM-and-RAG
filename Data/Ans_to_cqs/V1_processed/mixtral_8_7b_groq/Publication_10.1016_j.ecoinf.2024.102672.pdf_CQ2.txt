The provided context does not specify the type of data format used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of open source libraries and frameworks for the Python 3 programming language, such as NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Shap. These libraries and frameworks can handle various data formats, including but not limited to CSV, image, audio, and video.

In the study, the authors used a dataset of water temperature and meteorological data to predict the temperature profile in water masses. They developed machine learning models based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) using meteorological conditions as inputs. The data used in this study is likely in the form of a time-series dataset, which is a type of data that changes over time.

Moreover, the study also mentions the use of a classification model to detect if there existed stratification or not in the reservoir. The model stored the existence of stratification as a new categorical binary variable, which suggests that the data used in the classification model is also likely in the form of a categorical variable.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the type of data format used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that the study used a time-series dataset and categorical variable for the machine learning and deep learning models.
