Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipelines. However, I can provide a general overview of some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning.

Data augmentation is a crucial step in deep learning pipelines, especially for computer vision tasks. It helps increase the size of the training dataset, reduce overfitting, and improve the model's generalization ability. Some common data augmentation techniques include:

1. Flipping: Flipping the image horizontally or vertically is a simple yet effective data augmentation technique. Horizontal flipping is more common, as it can help the model learn symmetrical features.
2. Rotation: Rotating the image by a certain angle can help the model learn features invariant to rotation. This technique is particularly useful for tasks where the object's orientation may vary.
3. Scaling: Scaling or zooming the image can help the model learn features invariant to scale. This technique is useful for tasks where the object's size may vary.
4. Translation: Translating the image by a few pixels in the horizontal or vertical direction can help the model learn features invariant to translation.
5. Color jittering: Changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue of the image can help the model learn features invariant to color changes.
6. Cropping: Randomly cropping the image can help the model learn features from different parts of the object.
7. Affine transformations: Applying a combination of translation, rotation, and scaling can help the model learn more complex transformations.
8. Elastic deformations: Applying non-rigid deformations to the image can help the model learn more complex features.

These techniques can be applied individually or in combination, depending on the specific task and dataset. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation techniques should be based on the problem at hand and the desired invariances.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines, common techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, translation, color jittering, cropping, affine transformations, and elastic deformations.
