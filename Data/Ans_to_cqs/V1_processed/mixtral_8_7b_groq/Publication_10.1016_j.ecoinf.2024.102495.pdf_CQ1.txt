The provided context does not give specific details about how raw data is collected in the deep learning pipeline for the study. However, it does mention that the data used in this case is mosquito voice recordings. Therefore, it can be inferred that the raw data was likely collected using audio recording devices or sensors.

The context also explains that once the raw data is collected, it undergoes feature extraction using a process called Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The FFT window size used in this study is 1024. This step converts the time-domain signal into a frequency-domain signal, which is then used as input for the deep learning model.

The deep learning model used in this study is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is a type of neural network commonly used for image and sound classification tasks. The CNN automatically performs feature extraction through a convolution process that applies a convolution kernel to the input data and pooling, which progressively reduces the spatial size of data representation.

The context also mentions that the feature extraction parameters that yielded the best performance were employed during the feature extraction phase in optimizing the CNN deep learning model. The results of model optimization were acquired by employing identical performance metrics used in optimizing the feature extraction parameters.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific details about how the raw data was collected, it can be inferred that audio recording devices or sensors were used to collect mosquito voice recordings. The raw data then undergoes feature extraction using the FFT process, and the resulting frequency-domain signal is used as input for the CNN deep learning model.
