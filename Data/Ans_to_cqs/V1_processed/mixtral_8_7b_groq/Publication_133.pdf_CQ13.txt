The specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the provided context are not explicitly stated. However, we can infer that the model was trained using the YOLOv5 architecture, and it was optimized using a stochastic gradient algorithm. The learning rate and other hyperparameters were likely adjusted during the training process to minimize overfitting and improve the model's performance. The training process was monitored using a validation set, and the training was stopped after 30 epochs when the validation loss stabilized. The model's average precision (AP) was used as a metric to evaluate its performance.

Another hyperparameter that can be inferred is the confidence threshold, which was set to 0.7. This threshold was used to filter the model's predictions, and any prediction with a confidence score below this threshold was discarded.

In summary, while the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not provided, we can infer that the model was trained using the YOLOv5 architecture, optimized using a stochastic gradient algorithm, and the training process was monitored using a validation set. The confidence threshold was set to 0.7, and the training was stopped after 30 epochs when the validation loss stabilized.
