The purpose of the deep learning model in the context of the Mohedano et al. (2017) study is object retrieval. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were used to learn and extract features from images for the purpose of object retrieval. The study does not explicitly mention whether the deep learning model was used for classification, segmentation, or detection, but based on the context of object retrieval, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was likely used for object detection or object recognition within images.

In the context of the Petrovska et al. (2020) study, the deep learning model was used for feature extraction in remote sensing, specifically for aerial scene classification. The study used a deep learning model to extract features from aerial images, which were then used as input for a machine learning classifier. In this case, the deep learning model was used for feature extraction, not for classification, segmentation, or detection.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model varies depending on the study. In the Mohedano et al. (2017) study, the deep learning model was likely used for object detection or recognition, while in the Petrovska et al. (2020) study, the deep learning model was used for feature extraction.
