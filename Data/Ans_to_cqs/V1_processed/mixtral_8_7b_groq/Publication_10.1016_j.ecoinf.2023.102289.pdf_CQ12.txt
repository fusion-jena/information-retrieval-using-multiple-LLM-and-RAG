The deep learning model employed in the described pipeline is a semantic segmentation (SS) model, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The specific model used is the DeepLabv3 model with a Resnet269 backbone, which is a 269-layer Resnet neural network. This model is well-suited for landscape-based applications and is used to assign specific objects to each pixel of an image. The SS model consists of two main components: a downsampling network, which detects objects within an image, and an upsampling network, which assigns each pixel to its corresponding object. The DeepLabv3 model, in particular, has been trained on the ADE20K dataset, which focuses on the recognition of 150 indoor and outdoor objects, making it an ideal choice for landscape applications. The model's output is then exported in Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format. The AI platform used in this study operates on a Central Processing Unit (CPU) or Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and uses MXNet to provide the essential modules and functions required for the program operation.
