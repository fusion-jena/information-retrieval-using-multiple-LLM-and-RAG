Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this study. The context focuses on song variant tracking, data analysis, and authorship contributions, but it does not mention any specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

However, the study does mention data curation as one of the authorship contributions by Curt Jenner and Micheline N. Jenner. Data curation typically involves cleaning, organizing, and maintaining the data, but it does not necessarily include information about data annotation techniques.

Additionally, the study provides a link to the data in the manuscript, which may contain more information about the data annotation techniques used. However, without access to the manuscript or the data, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.

In summary, based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this study.
