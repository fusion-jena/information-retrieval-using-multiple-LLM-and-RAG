I regret to inform you that the provided context does not contain information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context focuses on discussing the Fire Weather Index (FWI) and Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) data layers, their spatial resolution, and the use of a nine-cell approach for prediction. Additionally, it mentions a paper by Beck et al. (2002), but there is no connection to deep learning model hyperparameters. I hope this information is helpful, and I'm ready to answer any other questions you may have.
