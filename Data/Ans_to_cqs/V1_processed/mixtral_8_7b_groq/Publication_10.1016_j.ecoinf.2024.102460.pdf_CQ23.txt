Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in the study. However, it can be inferred that the authors may have used some techniques to ensure the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

Firstly, the LSTM model, a type of deep learning model, was compared with other models such as the BP model and the Markov chain model. This comparison suggests that the authors may have taken steps to ensure that the LSTM model performs better and has advantages over other models in predicting time series data, including managing long-term dependency problems and multivariate time series data.

Secondly, the study used the Random Forest Classifier (RFC) to obtain the probability of development and the contribution of drivers for each land category. The RFC is a powerful machine learning algorithm that can handle large datasets with high dimensionality and prevent overfitting by using decision trees. The authors set the sampling rate to 0.1, the number of decision trees to 20, the number of features used to train the random forest to 9, and the number of parallels to 12 to improve the execution speed. These settings suggest that the authors may have taken steps to ensure that the RFC model performs well and provides accurate results.

Lastly, the study used the PLUS model to analyze the drivers of expansion for the six land types in the YRB-SX for the years 2000–2010 and 2010–2020. The PLUS model's root mean square error (RMSE) was less than 0.2, indicating that the model performed well. The RMSE is a measure of the difference between the values predicted by a model and the values actually observed, and a lower RMSE indicates better model performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it can be inferred that the authors may have used techniques such as comparing the LSTM model with other models, using the RFC to obtain accurate results, and using the PLUS model to analyze the drivers of expansion with a low RMSE. However, further information is needed to confirm these inferences.
