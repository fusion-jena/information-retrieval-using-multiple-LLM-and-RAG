The provided context does not include specific information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of machine learning, including deep learning, in the context of water quality parameter estimation using satellite data.

In this study, machine learning algorithms, including neural networks, are used to extract patterns from large datasets and establish relationships between input features and output variables. The performance of these algorithms is assessed using a training and test set approach, evaluating metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE).

While the text does not explicitly mention data annotation techniques, it is important to note that deep learning models typically require labeled data for training. Data annotation techniques, such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation, are used to label and categorize data in a way that deep learning models can understand.

For example, in the context of image recognition, bounding box annotation involves drawing a box around an object of interest in an image and labeling it with a corresponding class. Instance segmentation, on the other hand, involves segmenting each instance of an object in an image and labeling it individually.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques, it is important to note that deep learning models typically require labeled data for training. Data annotation techniques, such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation, are used to label and categorize data in a way that deep learning models can understand.
