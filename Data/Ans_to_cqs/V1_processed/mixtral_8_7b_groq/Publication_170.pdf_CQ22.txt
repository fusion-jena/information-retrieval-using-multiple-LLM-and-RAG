The performance of the deep learning model in the study was evaluated using three metrics: overall error, commission error, and omission error.

The overall error is a measure of the total number of incorrect predictions made by the model. It is calculated as the sum of the commission error and the omission error.

The commission error, also known as false positive rate, is a measure of the proportion of negative instances that were incorrectly classified as positive. It is calculated as the number of false positives divided by the sum of false positives and true positives.

The omission error, also known as false negative rate, is a measure of the proportion of positive instances that were incorrectly classified as negative. It is calculated as the number of false negatives divided by the sum of false negatives and true positives.

These metrics are defined by equations (2), (3), and (4) in the context, and they were used to evaluate the performance of the models in different training phases. The model error evaluation was conducted using a fixed test set (Test) consisting of 7,298 images.

It is worth noting that the time costs evaluation was also an important aspect of the model evaluation in this study. The time costs evaluation included model training time costs and image recognition rate. The training time costs referred to the time required for the model to complete its training on a specific training set. The image recognition rate referred to the number of images recognized by the software in a unit of time.

In summary, the performance of the deep learning model in the study was evaluated using three metrics: overall error, commission error, and omission error. Additionally, the time costs evaluation was also conducted to assess the efficiency of the model.
