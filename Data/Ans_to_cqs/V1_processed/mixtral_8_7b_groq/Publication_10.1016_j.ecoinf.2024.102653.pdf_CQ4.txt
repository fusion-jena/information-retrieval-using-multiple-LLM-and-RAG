The provided context discusses the methodology of a deep-learning architecture for toxicovigilance but does not mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to increase the amount and diversity of training data by applying random transformations to the existing data. However, the specific methods used in this case are not provided.

The context does mention the use of a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model with hyperparameters such as ADAM optimizer, learning rate of 0.003, batch size of 32, epochs of 100, dropout rate of 0.5, and binary cross-entropy loss function. The model uses dual BiLSTM layers, dropout regularization, and a densely connected layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation function. The model also utilizes the NVIDIA CUDA Deep Neural Network (cuDNN) library to enhance computational efficiency and reduce training duration.

Therefore, while data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning, the provided context does not specify any such techniques used in this particular pipeline.
