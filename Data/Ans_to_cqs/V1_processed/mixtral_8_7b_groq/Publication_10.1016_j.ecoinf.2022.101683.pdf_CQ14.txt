Based on the provided context, there is no information given about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. The text focuses on the threshold used for model evaluation, which is the 10th percentile training presence, and the use of this threshold to compare models trained on different datasets. Additionally, the text provides model evaluation metrics for various models, including those for random background, filtered, targeted, filtered and targeted, and weighted sampling efforts. However, the specific method of hyperparameter optimization is not mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
