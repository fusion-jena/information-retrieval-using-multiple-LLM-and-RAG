Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The text focuses on the experimental setup, data processing, and comparison of different methods for estimating the true population size, particularly in the context of missing data.

However, it does mention several methods used for data processing and analysis, such as:

1. Control Group: In both experiments, a control group was defined, consisting of unmodified datasets in the first experiment and a geometric profile extracted by an experienced operator in the second experiment. Comparing the model outputs with these control groups could implicitly serve as a way to monitor model performance.
2. Delete Case: This method involves removing all data rows containing missing values. While not a monitoring strategy per se, it is a way to handle missing data.
3. Mean Imputation: This method involves replacing missing values with the mean of the available data. Similar to the "Delete Case" method, it is a data processing technique rather than a monitoring strategy.

Moreover, the text mentions various models and methods, such as the FIT method, omitting missing values, and machine-learning-based procedures. Still, it does not provide information on how the performance of these models was monitored during training.

In summary, while the text discusses various methods for data processing and comparison, it does not explicitly mention a strategy for monitoring model performance during training.
