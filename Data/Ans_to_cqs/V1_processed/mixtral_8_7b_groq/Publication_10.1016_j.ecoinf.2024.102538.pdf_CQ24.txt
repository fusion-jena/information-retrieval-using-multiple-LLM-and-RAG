In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the setting of a random seed value. However, there are descriptions of various data augmentation techniques used to improve model performance and handle issues like within-class variation and limited data availability. These techniques include random distortion, adding background noise, and random clipping and splicing.

Random distortion is introduced by applying a tanh function to yield a "soft clipping" type of distortion with a probability of 0.25. The distortion amount is proportional to the input gain. This technique helps increase the model's robustness to variations in the input data.

Adding background noise is another data augmentation technique where noise files are randomly selected and added to the input data. This method exposes the model to a more diverse set of conditions, helping it generalize better.

Random clipping and splicing involve cropping and concatenating spectrograms of the same species to expand the sample size. This technique creates new samples by combining existing ones, which can help the model learn to handle a wider variety of inputs.

While these techniques do not directly address the issue of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they do demonstrate strategies for improving model performance and handling data limitations. Techniques like these can help reduce the model's sensitivity to random variations in the input data, indirectly addressing the issue of randomness.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does describe data augmentation techniques that can help reduce the model's sensitivity to random variations in the input data.
