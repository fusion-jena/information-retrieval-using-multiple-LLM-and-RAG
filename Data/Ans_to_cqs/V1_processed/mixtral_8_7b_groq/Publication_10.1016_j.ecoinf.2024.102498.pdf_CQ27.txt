The text provided does not give a detailed explanation of how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, it does mention that deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), were used for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification. It also states that the models were trained and validated within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform.

The process of deploying a trained model typically involves model serialization, which is the process of saving the model's architecture and learned parameters so that it can be used later. The text does not explicitly mention model serialization, but it does provide tables (Table 3) listing the hyperparameters for each machine learning technique, which suggests that the models were at least partially configured for this purpose.

As for platform selection, the text specifies that the models were trained and validated within the GEE platform. Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform for processing and analyzing geospatial data, including satellite imagery. It provides a JavaScript API for writing code to access and analyze data, as well as built-in machine learning algorithms that can be used for tasks like LULC classification.

In summary, while the text does not provide a detailed explanation of how the trained deep learning model was deployed, it does suggest that the models were trained and validated within the GEE platform, and that they were configured with specific hyperparameters. However, it does not mention model serialization or specify how the model was deployed for use in LULC classification.
