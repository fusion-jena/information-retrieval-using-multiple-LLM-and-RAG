I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context consists of tables and text describing the data augmentation strategies, models used, and their configurations for birdsong classification. However, there is no information about where the code for this project is hosted. Therefore, I am unable to provide the code repository link in this case.
