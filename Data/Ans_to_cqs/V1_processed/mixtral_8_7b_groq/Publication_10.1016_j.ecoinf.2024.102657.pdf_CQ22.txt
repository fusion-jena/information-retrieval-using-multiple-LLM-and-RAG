The performance of the deep learning model was evaluated using the accuracy metric. The accuracy is calculated as the number of correct classifications divided by the total number of classifications. In this case, the deep learning model classified bird songs into different dialects, and the accuracy was calculated for each dialect class. The overall accuracy of the model was also reported. Additionally, the performance of the model was assessed on noise-filtered data versus raw data, and the accuracy levels were similar, indicating that the model performs well on both types of data.
