The provided context does not give information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses a method for ecological informatics that involves the use of a penalized loss function and the root trimmed mean squared prediction error (RTMSPE) to select tuning parameters in a model. The model appears to be used for analyzing ecological data, but the specific computational infrastructure used to implement the model is not mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
