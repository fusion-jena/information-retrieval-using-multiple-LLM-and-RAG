The provided context does not contain information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the comparison of different methods for predicting ecological intensities with varying abundance and correlation, and the impact of adding a lasso penalty and bias correction on the performance of those methods.

The context includes details about the meanRSS performances of different tests and methods, as well as figures and coefficients for 50% and 80% hidden observations. However, there is no mention of the code repository or where the deep learning pipeline can be found.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot answer the query regarding the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline.
