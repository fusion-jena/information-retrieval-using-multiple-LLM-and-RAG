The provided context does not directly answer the query about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does give some insight into the type of data used in the studies mentioned, which are related to image processing and computer vision in the field of agriculture.

In the study by Liu and Fan (2013), a model of visual attention for natural image retrieval is presented, which suggests the use of natural images as data. In the context, there are several references to image segmentation and feature maps, which indicate the use of image data. Specifically, the studies by Wan et al. (2023), Liu et al. (2019b), Zhao et al. (2020), and Liu et al. (2021) all involve the use of image data for tasks such as semantic segmentation, object detection, and contextual information extraction.

As for the sources of the image data, the context does not provide specific information. However, it can be inferred that some of the data may have been collected through sensors or other means of image capture, as the studies involve the analysis of visible branches and ground forest images. Additionally, the use of public datasets cannot be ruled out, as this is a common practice in deep learning research.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest the use of image data in the studies mentioned. The sources of the image data are not specified, but they may have been collected through sensors or other means of image capture, as well as from public datasets.
