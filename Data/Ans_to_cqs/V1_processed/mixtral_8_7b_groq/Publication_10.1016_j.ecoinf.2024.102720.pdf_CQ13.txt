Based on the provided context, there is one specific study that mentions using a deep learning algorithm for strategic planning (IseB 21, 9). However, the text does not provide details about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer.

Hyperparameters are crucial components of deep learning models that can significantly impact the model's performance. Commonly used hyperparameters include learning rate, number of layers, number of neurons, optimizer, activation function, batch size, and dropout rate. The learning rate determines the size of the steps taken during gradient descent, while the optimizer is the algorithm used to find the minimum of the loss function.

Unfortunately, without further information from the study, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query. It is recommended to refer to the original study or contact the authors for more information on the hyperparameters used in their deep learning model.

In summary, while the provided context mentions a study that used a deep learning algorithm for strategic planning, it does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in the model.
