Based on the provided context, there is not enough information to directly answer the query about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in a machine learning model. However, the context does contain statistics and data related to sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations in a province, which could be used to illustrate a general concept of using a performance metric plateau to determine training completion.

In the context of the SO2 concentration data, one might use the mean or standard deviation as a performance metric to evaluate a model's training progress. If the model's performance, as measured by the metric, shows a consistent and prolonged period of little to no improvement, it could be an indicator that the training process has reached a plateau and can be considered complete.


 The criteria used to determine when training is complete in machine learning models often involve monitoring a performance metric and stopping the training process when the metric shows a plateau, indicating that further training is unlikely to significantly improve the model's performance. For example, in the context of SO2 concentration data, one might use the mean or standard deviation as a performance metric. If the model's performance, as measured by the metric, exhibits a prolonged period of little to no improvement, it could suggest that the training process has reached a plateau and can be considered complete.
