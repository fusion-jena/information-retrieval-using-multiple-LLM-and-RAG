The provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It mainly focuses on the comparison of dataset sizes for the WT-HMM (Wavelet Transform Hidden Markov Model) model in the context of bioacoustic monitoring.

However, some general steps can be inferred from the broader field of deep learning model deployment:

1. Model Serialization: Once the model has been trained and validated, it is typically saved or serialized. This involves saving the model architecture, weights, and other relevant parameters to a file. This file can then be used to re-create the exact same model without having to retrain it.

2. Platform Selection: The choice of platform for deployment depends on the specific requirements of the project. This could range from a local machine for smaller-scale projects to cloud-based platforms like Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure for larger-scale projects. The choice of platform would also depend on factors like computational resources, cost, and ease of integration with existing systems.

3. Model Validation: Before deployment, the model is usually validated on a separate dataset to ensure that it performs as expected.

4. Model Deployment: Once the model has been serialized and validated, it can be deployed to the chosen platform. This could involve integrating it with an existing application or service, or creating a new one.

5. Model Monitoring and Updating: After deployment, the model's performance should be monitored regularly. If the model's performance drops over time, it may need to be retrained or updated with new data.

While these are general steps in the model deployment process, the specifics can vary greatly depending on the project and the chosen platform. Therefore, without more specific information from the provided context, it is not possible to give a detailed answer to this query.
