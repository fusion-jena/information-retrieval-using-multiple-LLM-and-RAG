The provided context does not include information about a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The pipeline was implemented using Google Cloud computing and Landsat 8 imagery, but the exact repository or location where the code, models, or data are stored for reuse or access by other researchers is not mentioned. It is possible that the data and code are available upon request to the authors or through the Amazon Environmental Research Institute (IPAM) and University of Bras√≠lia where the authors are affiliated.
