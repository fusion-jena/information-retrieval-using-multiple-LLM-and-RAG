The provided context does not give specific information about the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does discuss a study that uses a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for semantic segmentation of boreal forest ground cover vegetation.

In this study, the authors used field measurements and ground photographs collected at three different locations in Alberta, Canada for training, testing, and validation of the DCNN. The process of collecting and using these datasets may involve some level of randomness, but the text does not provide details about how this randomness was handled.

It is worth noting that the use of a random seed value is a common strategy to ensure reproducibility in deep learning models. By setting a fixed random seed value, researchers can ensure that the random initialization of model weights and other random processes, such as data shuffling, produce the same results across different runs of the model. This can help to increase the reliability and validity of the model's performance.

Therefore, while the provided context does not specifically mention the use of a random seed value, it is possible that the authors employed this strategy to handle randomness in their deep learning pipeline. However, without further information, this is only a speculation.
