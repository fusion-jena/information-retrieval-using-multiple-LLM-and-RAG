Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix after model training. However, it does mention that the prediction error is calculated by comparing the predicted value Å·m+ma with the validation data ym+ma at different starting times. This suggests that some form of error calculation is being performed post-training. Additionally, it is noted that the findings revealed a significant reduction in computation time when machine learning (ML) models, along with preselection, were used. It is also mentioned that the amount of input data can have a non-negligible influence on predictive performance. These are general observations and not specific postprocessing steps. Therefore, the specific postprocessing steps after model training, as mentioned in the query, are not discussed in the provided context.
