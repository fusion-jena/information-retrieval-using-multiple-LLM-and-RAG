The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This information can be inferred from the context provided, which mentions the use of a pre-trained convolutional neural network called AlexNet. CNNs are a category of neural networks that have been successful in solving complex tasks, especially in the field of computer vision. They are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from the input data, which makes them particularly suitable for image classification tasks.

In this study, the researchers used AlexNet, which is a well-known CNN architecture, to identify triatomine genera (Triatoma, Panstrongylus, and Rhodnius) using low-resolution pictures taken with ordinary cellphone cameras. The CNN was implemented in MATLAB, and the training was done using the stochastic gradient descent with momentum optimizer.

The use of a CNN model in this study is a suitable choice, considering the goal of developing an automated identification system for Chagas disease vectors that can work accurately with pictures of uneven quality and resolution taken with ordinary cellphone cameras. CNNs have shown to be robust to variations in image quality and can learn features invariant to scale, orientation, and position, making them ideal for this task.

In summary, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the pre-trained AlexNet architecture. CNNs are a powerful tool for image classification tasks, and their use in this study is a suitable choice for developing an automated identification system for Chagas disease vectors.
