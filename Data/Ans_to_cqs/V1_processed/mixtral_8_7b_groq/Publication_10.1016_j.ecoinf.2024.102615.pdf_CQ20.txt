The provided context does not include information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text focuses on the optimization of the MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) model's architecture and hyperparameters. It mentions the use of a set of training data for training and validation data for verification, but it does not specify the hardware used for these processes. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model.
