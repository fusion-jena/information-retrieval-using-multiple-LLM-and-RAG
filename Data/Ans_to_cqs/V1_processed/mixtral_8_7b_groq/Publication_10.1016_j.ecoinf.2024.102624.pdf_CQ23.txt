The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it does describe several measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the models used in the study, which were Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS).

To ensure the generalizability of the models, the study used data augmentation, post-classification processing, and hyperparameter tuning. Data augmentation involves extending the existing training data to enhance the model's generalization capabilities. Post-classification processing, such as segmentation and filtering, provides better maps with a lower rate of salt-and-pepper errors. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using a grid search, where the hyperparameters were varied over a range of values to find the best models with the largest overall accuracy.

Additionally, the study used two types of accuracy assessments. In the model building phase, the training dataset was split into 10 folds using 10-fold cross-validation with three repetitions. This approach helps to find the best models with the largest overall accuracy and reflects the distribution of possible model outcomes with minimums, maximums, quartiles, and medians. The smaller the range of possible model outcomes, the more reliable the prediction. Based on the testing dataset, the models were used to predict the ecological variables.

Therefore, while the study does not explicitly mention deep learning, it does describe several measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the models used, such as data augmentation, post-classification processing, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation.
