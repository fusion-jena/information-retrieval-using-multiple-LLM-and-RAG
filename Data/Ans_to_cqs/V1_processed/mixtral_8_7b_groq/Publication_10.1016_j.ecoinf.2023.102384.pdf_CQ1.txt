Based on the provided context, the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for agriculture and ecological informatics are not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer that sensors and non-publicly available datasets are likely used for data collection.

In the context "A vision-based counting and recognition system for infestation of tomato plants by aphids modulates transmission-acquisition dynamics of flying insects in intelligent agriculture" (Zhong et al., 2018), a vision-based system is used for counting and recognizing aphids on tomato plants. This implies the use of cameras or other visual sensors to collect data.

Furthermore, in "Small pests detection in field crops using deep learning object detection" (Khalid et al., 2023), the authors use deep learning object detection for detecting small pests in field crops. While the specific data collection method is not mentioned, it can be inferred that they use images or videos captured by cameras or other visual sensors as input data.

Moreover, the context "evaluation is performed using counting metrics, again, on a non-publicly available dataset" (EcologicalInformatics78(2023)10238411) suggests that a non-publicly available dataset is used for evaluation, implying that such a dataset might have been used for training as well.

In addition, the context "agri-IoT: A semantic framework for internet of things-enabled smart farming applications" (Kamilaris et al., 2016) discusses the use of IoT in smart farming applications, which includes sensors for collecting data.

To summarize, while the specific methods for data collection are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that sensors, particularly visual sensors, and non-publicly available datasets are used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for agriculture and ecological informatics.
