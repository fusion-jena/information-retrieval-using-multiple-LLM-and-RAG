The provided context discusses the use of eCognition for image segmentation and classification, as well as the application of a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to classify land cover in a forested area. However, it does not directly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

In general, preprocessing data before training a deep learning model is an important step to ensure the quality of the model's performance. Preprocessing can include cleaning the data by removing outliers or irrelevant features, normalizing the data to have zero mean and unit variance, and scaling the data to a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1). These steps can help the deep learning model converge faster and perform better.

While the context does not explicitly mention these preprocessing steps, it does discuss the use of machine learning techniques for image classification. Specifically, it mentions that "machine learning techniques are being brought together with segmentation to more automatically classify images" (Eitzel et al., 2016). This suggests that some form of preprocessing may be necessary before applying machine learning algorithms to image data.

In the context of image processing, preprocessing can include steps such as noise reduction, image enhancement, and feature extraction. Noise reduction can involve techniques such as median filtering or Gaussian blurring to remove random noise from the image. Image enhancement can involve techniques such as histogram equalization or contrast stretching to improve the image's quality. Feature extraction can involve techniques such as edge detection or texture analysis to extract relevant features from the image.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, it is generally accepted that preprocessing data is an important step to ensure the quality of the model's performance. In the context of image processing, preprocessing can include steps such as noise reduction, image enhancement, and feature extraction.
