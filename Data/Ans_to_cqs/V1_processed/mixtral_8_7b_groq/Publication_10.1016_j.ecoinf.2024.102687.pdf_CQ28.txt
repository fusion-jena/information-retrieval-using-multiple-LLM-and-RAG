The provided context does not give information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It mainly focuses on the comparative analysis of different CNN backbones (ResNet18, VGG16, DenseNet121, and AlexNet) in the context of eco-acoustics with deep learning (DL). The energy consumption of these models was measured and analyzed, but there is no mention of the platform where they were deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
