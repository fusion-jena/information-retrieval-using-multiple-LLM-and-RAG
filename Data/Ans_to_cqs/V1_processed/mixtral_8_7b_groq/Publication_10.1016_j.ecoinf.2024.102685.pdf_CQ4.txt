Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Random Forest classification, which is a machine learning technique, and not deep learning.

In general, data augmentation techniques for deep learning include flipping, rotating, and scaling, as you mentioned. These techniques are used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by creating modified versions of the existing images. Flipping involves horizontally or vertically flipping the image, while rotating involves rotating the image by a certain angle. Scaling involves changing the size of the image, either by zooming in or out. These techniques can help improve the model's ability to generalize and reduce overfitting.

Other data augmentation techniques that are commonly used in deep learning include cropping, brightness and contrast adjustment, and adding noise. Cropping involves removing a portion of the image, which can help the model to focus on the important features. Brightness and contrast adjustment involve changing the brightness and contrast of the image, which can help the model to learn to recognize features in different lighting conditions. Adding noise involves adding random noise to the image, which can help the model to learn to recognize features in the presence of noise.

It's worth noting that the choice of data augmentation techniques depends on the specific problem and dataset. For example, if the dataset contains a lot of images with different orientations, then rotating the images may not be helpful. Similarly, if the dataset contains a lot of images with different lighting conditions, then brightness and contrast adjustment may be more helpful.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used techniques. Other techniques such as cropping, brightness and contrast adjustment, and adding noise can also be used depending on the specific problem and dataset.
