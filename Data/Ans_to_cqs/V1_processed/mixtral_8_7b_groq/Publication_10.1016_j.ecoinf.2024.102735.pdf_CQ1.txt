The raw data for the deep learning pipeline in the context provided is collected using continuous sensor-based water quality datasets. These datasets are sourced from the Land Development Division of Greenville County and span a period from December 2014 to July 2021. The sensors are strategically positioned at Boyd Millpond's outlet, specifically at coordinates 34°27'18.2"N and 82°27'12.00.0”W, and measure a range of parameters at approximately 15-minute intervals. The parameters measured include pH, temperature, specific conductivity (μs/cm), turbidity (FNU), dissolved oxygen (mg/l), saturated dissolved oxygen (%), oxidation-reduction potential (mV), and chlorophyll-a levels (μg/l). The sensor-based data collection allows for a large dataset of 155,914 readings, which provides a substantial amount of data for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, in this specific context, continuous sensor-based water quality datasets are used for collecting raw data.
