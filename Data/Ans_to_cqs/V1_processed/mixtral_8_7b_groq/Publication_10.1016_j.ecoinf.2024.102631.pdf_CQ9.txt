I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the description of the network architecture, its performance in different datasets, and the limitations of the model. However, it does not mention any specific data repository where the pipeline's data is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional context.
