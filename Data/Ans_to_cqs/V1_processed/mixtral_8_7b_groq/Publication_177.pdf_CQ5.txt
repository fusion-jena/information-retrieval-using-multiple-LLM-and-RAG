The two datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are UBD\_45 and VP\_200.

The UBD\_45 dataset was used to train and test deep neural network models for image classification of plants, specifically for images that do not belong to a known class of a plant. The highest testing accuracy was found to be around 96.7% using the InceptionResNetV2 network.

On the other hand, the VP\_200 dataset was used to classify a larger number of plant species, resulting in a more balanced dataset with a larger number of samples. However, the validation and testing accuracies were comparatively lower than the UBD\_45 dataset. The maximum testing accuracy was found to be 91.8% using the Xception net, with the second closest one being 91.2% using InceptionResNetV2.

These two datasets were used to evaluate the performance of deep neural network models for image classification of plants, specifically for images that do not belong to a known class of a plant. The models were initialized with pre-trained ImageNet weights and fine-tuned to the datasets. Bayesian optimization was employed to find the optimal values for batch size and initial learning rate.
