Based on the provided context, there are no specific details mentioned about postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix after the model training. However, the context does provide information about the evaluation of the models used for rice canopy coverage estimation.

The evaluation of the models includes the calculation of coefficients of determination (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) for both the training data and validation set. The R2 value indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable, while the RMSE value measures the differences between values predicted by a model and the values actually observed. Additionally, relative error percentage (REP) is calculated for the validation set, which measures the relative error between the predicted and actual values.

Moreover, Fig. 5 of the context shows the relationship between the field survey value and the predicted value of chlorophyll content from different models using the validation set. This figure provides a visual representation of the model's performance, which can be used to assess the accuracy of the models.

Therefore, while there are no specific postprocessing steps mentioned in the context, the evaluation of the models includes the calculation of R2, RMSE, and REP, as well as visual representation of the model's performance.
