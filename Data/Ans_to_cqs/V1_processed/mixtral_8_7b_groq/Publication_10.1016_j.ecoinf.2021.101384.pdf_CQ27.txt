The provided context does not give detailed information on how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, it does mention that the workflow combines vessel tracking data from satellite and AIS systems with global, high-quality, environmental, biodiversity, and fishery data. It also mentions that the vessel tracking data comes from the Global Fishing Watch (GFW) platform, which distributes vessel data aggregated at 0.01 resolutions with fishing activity cells already classified through a machine learning model.

From this information, we can infer that the deep learning model was likely trained using the vessel tracking data and other relevant data from the GFW platform. The model was then likely serialized and deployed on the GFW platform, where it is used to classify fishing activity cells in the vessel tracking data.

Additionally, the context states that the workflow is an Open Science workflow, which suggests that the model and the code used to train and deploy it are publicly available.

It is also worth noting that the context states that the statistical analysis has a higher precision when vessel data is abundant and the analysis resolution is suited to the study area. This implies that the deep learning model's performance may depend on the quantity and quality of the vessel data, as well as the appropriate spatial resolution for the analysis.

In summary, while the provided context does not give detailed information on the process used to deploy the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the model was trained using vessel tracking data from the GFW platform, serialized and deployed on the same platform, and that its performance may depend on the quantity and quality of the vessel data and the appropriate spatial resolution for the analysis.
