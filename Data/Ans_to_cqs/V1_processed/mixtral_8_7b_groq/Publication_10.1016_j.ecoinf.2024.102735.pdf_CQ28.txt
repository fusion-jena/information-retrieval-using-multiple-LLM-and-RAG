Based on the provided context, there is no specific information that indicates which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The context includes several studies that discuss the use of deep learning for predicting harmful algal blooms (HABs) and chlorophyll-a concentration, but it does not mention any details about the cloud platforms used for deployment.

In the study by Busari et al. (2024), the authors developed a deep learning model with Bayesian approximation for uncertainty assessment to predict chlorophyll-a as an indicator of HABs. However, the context does not provide information about the platform used for deployment. Similarly, Cen et al. (2022) applied deep learning in the prediction of chlorophyll-a in the East China Sea, but there is no information about the platform used for deployment.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
