The provided context does not discuss data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. However, it does describe a method for simulating climatic data using uniform distributions for temperature (θ) and humidity (ρ) values. This involves generating a set of arbitrary partitions (P) and checking the relationship between the expected marginal infection (E) and the rate of expansion for different parameter combinations.

To further validate the assumption of a connection between E and the spread rate, the Pearson correlation between E and the average spread rate (dk) is calculated. This allows for the investigation of a linear relationship between the two measures.

The context also highlights the importance of considering the range of values that the parameters can take, particularly for partitions, which should be determined based on wind intensity. For C and p0, specific information about the phenomenon can be used to determine their values.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, it does describe a method for simulating climatic data and investigating the relationship between different parameters and the rate of expansion.
