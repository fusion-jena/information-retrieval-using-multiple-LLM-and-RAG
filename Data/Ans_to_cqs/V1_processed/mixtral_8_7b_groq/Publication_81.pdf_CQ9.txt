The provided context does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The study describes a novel deep learning method called ESK that fuses Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for fish classification based on DNA barcode sequences. However, there is no mention of where the data repository is available. The study may have used private datasets or not deposited the datasets in any public repository. It is recommended to contact the authors or look for additional information in the related publications or repositories.
