In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it is common practice in deep learning to use a fixed seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.

In PyTorch, a popular deep learning library, the random number generator can be initialized with a specific seed value using the `manual_seed` function (Paszke et al. 2019). This ensures that the random number generation process is deterministic and produces the same sequence of random numbers across different runs of the code.

In the R workflow proposed for deep learning and statistical ecology, a reproducible example of species identification on camera trap images is provided (Lahoz-Monfort and Magrath 2021). While the specific strategy for handling randomness is not mentioned, it is likely that a fixed seed value was used to ensure reproducibility of results.

Furthermore, in statistical models used for quantifying spatial co-occurrence, randomness may be handled using techniques such as bootstrapping or cross-validation to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the model (Rota et al. 2016).

In summary, while the specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is common practice to use a fixed seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. Additionally, other techniques such as bootstrapping or cross-validation may be used to handle randomness in statistical models.
