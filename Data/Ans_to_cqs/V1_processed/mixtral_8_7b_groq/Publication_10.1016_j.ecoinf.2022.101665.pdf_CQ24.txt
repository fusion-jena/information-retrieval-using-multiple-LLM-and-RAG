The provided context discusses methods for assessing the accuracy of thematic maps produced by statistical prediction methods, particularly in situations where data availability is limited and resampling methods are required. While the text does not directly address strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, it does mention the use of a random seed value in the context of a systematic random sample.

In the systematic random sample method, a regular grid is used to produce an equal density of sample points over the study area. To achieve this, an initial square sampling grid is spaced so as to achieve the desired sample size, and then shifts in the x and y directions are applied. These shifts are sampled from a uniform distribution, and the random seed value determines the starting point of this distribution. By setting a specific random seed value, researchers can ensure the reproducibility of their results.

In the context of deep learning pipelines, randomness can be introduced at various stages, such as data shuffling, weight initialization, and dropout regularization. To handle this randomness, deep learning practitioners can employ several strategies.

One common approach is to set a fixed random seed value at the beginning of the training process. This ensures that the same random events, such as the order in which data samples are presented or the initial weights of the model, are replicated across multiple runs. By doing so, researchers can increase the reproducibility of their experiments and reduce the impact of randomness on their results.

Another strategy for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines is to use techniques such as cross-validation and ensemble methods. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on different subsets of the data, and then aggregating the results to obtain a more robust estimate of the model's performance. Ensemble methods, on the other hand, involve training multiple models on different subsets of the data and then combining their predictions to improve the overall performance and reduce the impact of individual random events.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, it does mention the use of a random seed value in the context of a systematic random sample. In deep learning, practitioners can handle randomness by setting a fixed random seed value, using cross-validation, and employing ensemble methods.
