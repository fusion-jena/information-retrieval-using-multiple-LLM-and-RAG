The provided context does not include information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization methods. The context focuses on the downscaled forest biomass density and its spatial distribution, as well as uncertainties in biomass density estimates. It includes various studies related to estimating forest biomass and carbon storage, but none of them discuss the optimization of model hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
