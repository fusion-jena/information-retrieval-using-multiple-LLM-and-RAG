Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context focuses on the methods and functionalities of the NasaWebServiceAPIProvider class and the data management strategies used in the nasawebservice package.

However, it can be inferred that the developers have implemented a cloud-based solution with a focus on efficient data management and handling large volumes of requests. This suggests that they might be using monitoring and logging tools to track the performance of the service and the models during training.

Additionally, the use of an iterator for handling large volumes of requests in the execute\_many() method indicates that the developers are aware of the importance of efficient memory management during data processing. This attention to detail and optimization could extend to the training and monitoring of models as well.

In conclusion, while the context does not provide explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, it can be inferred that the developers have implemented a cloud-based solution with a focus on efficient data management and optimization. This suggests that they might be using monitoring and logging tools to track the performance of the service and the models during training.
