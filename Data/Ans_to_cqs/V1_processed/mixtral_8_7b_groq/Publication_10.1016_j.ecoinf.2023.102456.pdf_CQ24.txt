In the context provided, there are two main strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline: the use of a stochastic update criterion and the application of the Bernoulli random variable.

The stochastic update criterion is used in the model's ability to determine the probabilities of infection (susceptibility or death) of each cell and generation. This is achieved through a randomness element introduced in the computational process, which allows for the model to be used as a Monte Carlo method. By applying the law of large numbers, the frequency of the event for each cell in each generation provides an estimate of the probability of that state occurring. This strategy enables the model to account for uncertainties and variabilities in the system.

The Bernoulli random variable is used to determine whether a given cell is infected or not. In practice, a random extraction is performed to update each cell, using the probabilities derived from the neighborhood relationship. This approach has been used in the simulation of the behavior of the system, where a given state of the grid is updated based on random draws. The use of the Bernoulli random variable allows for the incorporation of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, which facilitates a more realistic representation of certain climatic phenomena and a more accurate simulation of the system's behavior.

Moreover, the Gumbel-Softmax function is a useful tool in optimizing neural networks involving discrete variables, such as those used in reinforcement learning and generative models. However, it is not a perfect substitute for the binary Bernoulli random variable, and the introduction of a stochastic element into the computational process may impact the estimates.

In summary, the use of a stochastic update criterion, the application of the Bernoulli random variable, and the Gumbel-Softmax function are strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. These strategies enable the model to account for uncertainties and variabilities in the system, facilitating a more realistic representation of certain climatic phenomena and a more accurate simulation of the system's behavior.
