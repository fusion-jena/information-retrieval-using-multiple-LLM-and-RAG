The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the provided context are CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and TLm.

The CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets are used in the study by Krizhevsky et al. (2009) as benchmark datasets for object recognition. These datasets contain 60,000 colored images of 32x32 pixels, divided into 10 and 100 classes, respectively.

ImageNet is a large-scale image recognition dataset, which contains more than 14 million images, belonging to 21,841 classes. It is widely used as a benchmark dataset for image classification tasks and is used as a pre-trained weight initialization for transfer learning in the studies by Ong and Hamid (2022) and the study using the ResNet50 architecture.

The TLm dataset is a dataset used in the study by La Grassa et al. (2021) for learning class hierarchy using convolutional neural networks. The study uses a multitask learning approach, where the models are trained to classify the images at different levels of the class hierarchy. The TLm dataset contains images of insects, and the class hierarchy consists of three levels: order, family, and species.

In summary, the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, ImageNet, and TLm are the datasets used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned in the provided context. These datasets are widely used in the field of computer vision and machine learning for various tasks such as image classification, object recognition, and transfer learning.
