The metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the study is classification accuracy. The authors divided the CLO-43SD dataset into 5 folds and performed 5-fold cross-validation, reporting the results as a box-plot generated from the per-fold accuracies. The best training epoch for the CNN model was identified using one of the 4 training folds as a validation set and training on the remaining 3 folds.

During training, the model optimized cross-entropy loss via mini-batch stochastic gradient descent. The authors used a constant learning rate of 0.01 and applied dropout to the input of the last two layers with a probability of 0.5. L2-regularization was applied to the weights of the last two layers with a penalty factor of 0.001. The model was trained for 100 epochs and checkpointed after each epoch. A validation set was used to identify the parameter setting (epoch) achieving the highest classification accuracy.

The authors did not mention other metrics such as precision or recall. However, classification accuracy is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models, especially in classification tasks. It measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions made. While other metrics like precision and recall provide more specific insights into the model's performance, classification accuracy is a good general measure of the model's overall effectiveness.
