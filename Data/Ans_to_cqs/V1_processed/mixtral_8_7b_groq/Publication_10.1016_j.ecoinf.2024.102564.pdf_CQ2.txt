Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general information about the data formats commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

In general, data formats used in machine learning and artificial intelligence can be categorized into structured data, unstructured data, and semi-structured data.

Structured data is organized in a tabular format, such as CSV or Excel files, where each row represents a record, and each column represents a field. These data formats are commonly used in supervised learning algorithms, such as regression and classification.

Unstructured data, on the other hand, does not have a predefined format and can include various types of data, such as text, images, audio, and video. These data formats require preprocessing techniques, such as feature extraction and data augmentation, before being fed into a machine learning algorithm.

Semi-structured data is a combination of structured and unstructured data, where the data has some organization but not as rigid as structured data. Examples of semi-structured data include JSON and XML files.

In the context of the Nguyen et al. (2019) study, the authors used object-based image analysis and random forest models to map vegetation types in semi-arid riparian regions. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data format used in this study is likely to be raster or vector image formats, such as GeoTIFF or shapefiles.

In the Castro and Farias (2020) study, the authors used machine learning models to predict the increment in diameter of individual trees in Atlantic Forest fragments. While the study does not explicitly mention the data format used, it is likely that the data is in a structured format, such as a CSV file, containing measurements of tree diameter and environmental variables.

Overall, the data format used in a deep learning pipeline depends on the specific problem and the type of data available. It is essential to preprocess and format the data appropriately before feeding it into a machine learning algorithm to ensure optimal performance.
