Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the application of various vegetation indices (VIs) such as EVI and SAVI for chlorophyll content estimation and rice disease identification. It does mention the modification of certain parameters for these VIs, such as the modification of EVI to 0.25 and the best parameter L of SAVI to 0.1 for paddy fields. However, it does not provide any details about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query based on the given context.
