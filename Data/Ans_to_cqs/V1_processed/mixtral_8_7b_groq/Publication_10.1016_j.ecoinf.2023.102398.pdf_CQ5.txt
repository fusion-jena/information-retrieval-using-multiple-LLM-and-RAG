The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context is Animal2-v1, which is publicly available in Roboflow. This dataset comprises 9952 images belonging to seven classes, namely Bear, Deer, Elephant, Leopard, Monkey, Tiger, and Wild-boar. Each image in the dataset is annotated in YOLOv5 PyTorch format and preprocessed for auto-orientation of pixel data with EXIF-format stripping. The images are then resized to 416 Ã— 416 (stretch) for the deep learning model. The dataset is divided into three sets, with 70% of images used for training, 20% for validation, and 10% for testing. No image augmentation techniques are applied to this dataset.

The Animal2-v1 dataset is used for custom training of the deep learning model based on the YOLOv5 architecture integrated with a SENet attention mechanism. The model is trained with different epoch values, including 100, 150, 200, and 250, to determine more accurate training results and explore the effect of epoch on training results. The training summary for each of these epochs is presented in Tables 5, 6, and 7, and the trends of mAP values with increasing epochs are shown in Figs. 14 and Fig. 15.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline described in the given context uses the Animal2-v1 dataset, which comprises 9952 images belonging to seven classes. The dataset is preprocessed and divided into three sets for training, validation, and testing. The deep learning model is trained with different epoch values using the YOLOv5 architecture integrated with a SENet attention mechanism.
