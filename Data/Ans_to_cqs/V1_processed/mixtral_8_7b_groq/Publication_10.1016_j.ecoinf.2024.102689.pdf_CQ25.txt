The deep learning models mentioned in the provided context are used for object detection and segmentation tasks. Specifically, an improved Video Object Segmentation (VOS) model, YOLOv5, and YOLOv8 are compared for their object detection and segmentation capabilities in underwater fish detection and segmentation tasks.

The VOS algorithm is used for precise pixel-level segmentation, which helps in extracting edge and intricate detail information of the object, thereby significantly reducing segmentation loss. This algorithm enhances the segmentation precision of the YOLOv7 model, which results in a more refined ability to recognize the object region. Consequently, this minimizes the likelihood of false detections.

Furthermore, the YOLOv7 model, when enhanced with the VOS algorithm, exhibits commendable performance in Recall(M), indicating its overall effectiveness in object detection. The VOS algorithm's superior capability in detecting objects enables a more comprehensive coverage of the object area, thereby minimizing missed detections.

In addition, the Fish-seg Dataset is used for training these models, and the dataset is partitioned into training, validation, and test sets in a ratio of 7:1.5:1.5 to ensure the robustness of the study. The final results are averaged from repeated experiments to mitigate potential biases.

Therefore, the deep learning models discussed in the context are primarily used for object detection and segmentation tasks, specifically for underwater fish detection and segmentation.
