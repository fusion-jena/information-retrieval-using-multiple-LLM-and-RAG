The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, was used to build the deep learning model. However, it does give some insights into the architecture of the model.

The model is built using a residual network structure that incorporates Res2Net modules and group convolution. This structure was introduced to replace the Feature Extraction Network (FEN) in the Deep SORT algorithm, improving the multi-scale representation and feature extraction.

Moreover, the YOLOv7 model was determined as the baseline model for tracking and identifying target objects in a scene with high dynamic density and low training data. YOLOv7 integrates the Extended Efficient Layer Aggregation Network (E-ELAN), cascade-based modeling, model scaling, and model reparameterization.

Therefore, while the specific deep learning framework is not specified, it can be inferred that the model was built using a custom architecture based on Res2Net and YOLOv7.
