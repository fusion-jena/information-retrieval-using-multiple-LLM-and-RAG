After reviewing the provided sources, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. None of the sources mention or provide a link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The sources mainly focus on topics related to ecological informatics, remote sensing, and the study of Hyphantria cunea, a type of moth. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
