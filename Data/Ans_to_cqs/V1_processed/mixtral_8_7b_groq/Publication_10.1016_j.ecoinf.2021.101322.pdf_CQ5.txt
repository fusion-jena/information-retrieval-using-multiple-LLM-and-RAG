The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for training a CNN model to determine the age of salmon based on scale images are the Salmon scale 9056 image dataset with a DOI of 10.21335/NMDC-1050865887 and an additional image dataset with a DOI of 10.21335/NMDC-1462728994. These datasets were used for training a CNN based on the EfficientNet architecture, specifically the EfficientNet-B4 model. The pre-trained weights for this model were obtained from the following GitHub repository: <https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet/blob/master/efficientnet/weights.py>.

The Salmon scale 9056 image dataset contains 9056 images of salmon scales, and an additional 150 images were used for expert reading. The specific details of the second image dataset are not provided in the context.

The CNN model was implemented using the Keras and TensorFlow software packages in Python, and computation was performed using CUDA version 9.1 and CuDNN with Nvidia P100 accelerator cards with 12 GB of GPU memory.
