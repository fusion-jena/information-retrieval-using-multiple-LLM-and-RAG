Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions that the implementation of the machine learning methods, including the deep learning model, was carried out in Python using the TensorFlow and Scikit-learn libraries. However, it does not specify where the code is hosted. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the code repository.
