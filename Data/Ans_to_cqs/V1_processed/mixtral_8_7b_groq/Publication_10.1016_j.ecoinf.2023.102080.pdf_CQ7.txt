Based on the provided context, there is no information suggesting that the data is split for deep learning model training. The context discusses a two-step "embedded" covariate selection procedure for species distribution models, which includes a collinearity-filtering algorithm and three model-specific embedded regularization techniques. However, there is no mention of deep learning models or any specific data splitting criteria.

The context does mention several other relevant details, such as the algorithms used for the embedding procedure, the target number of covariates to include in the final set, the maximum possible number of covariates, the number of cores used during parallel operations, the correlation coefficient threshold used for identifying collinearity, and the category-level and variable-level names for covariates.

Additionally, the context includes a table showing the percentage of species for which a given covariate selection procedure led to the top score value for each modeling algorithm, broken down by various categories of species.

However, none of this information relates to the splitting of data for deep learning model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
