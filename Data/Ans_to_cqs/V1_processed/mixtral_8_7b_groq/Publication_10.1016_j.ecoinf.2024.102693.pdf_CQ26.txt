The provided context discusses various models and techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, but it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. However, I can provide some general techniques that are commonly used to address data bias.


Some common techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures each subset or stratum of the population is proportionally represented in the sample. This technique can be used to ensure that all classes or categories are adequately represented in the training data, reducing bias.

Oversampling is a technique used to increase the representation of a minority class in the training data. This can help to reduce bias by ensuring that the model is exposed to a sufficient number of examples from each class.

Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the representation of a majority class in the training data. This can help to reduce bias by ensuring that the model is not overfitted to the majority class.

Diverse data collection is a technique used to ensure that the training data is representative of the entire population. This can help to reduce bias by ensuring that the model is exposed to a wide variety of examples, including those from underrepresented groups.

It is important to note that while these techniques can help to reduce bias, they are not a panacea. Bias can also be introduced at other stages of the deep learning pipeline, such as during data labeling or model training. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider all stages of the pipeline when attempting to reduce bias.
