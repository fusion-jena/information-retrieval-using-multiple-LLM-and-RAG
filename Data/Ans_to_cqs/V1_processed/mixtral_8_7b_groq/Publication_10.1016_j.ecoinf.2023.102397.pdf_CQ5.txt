Based on the provided context, there is no information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for species distribution modeling, equivalent to the well-known datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in computer vision. The context focuses on a study analyzing the effects of sample size and network depth on a deep learning approach for species distribution modeling using great tit (Parus major) songs.

The study uses two sets of data: a training set and a target set. The training set was used to train the deep neural network models, while the target set was used for evaluation and comparison of the software programs.

The target set consists of manual validations of S2 and S3 songs from various set names (T15_S2, T15_S3, T25_S2, T25_S3, T50_S2, T50_S3, T100_S2, T100_S3, T150_S2, T150_S3, T200_S2, T200_S3) and two test sets (Test_S2 and Test_S3). Each set name is associated with a specific number of manual validations (ranging from 15 to 400) and a corresponding total time (in minutes) for processing.

However, the context does not provide information on the origin, structure, or content of these datasets, making it impossible to compare them with the well-known datasets used in computer vision.

 The provided context does not offer sufficient information to determine the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for species distribution modeling.
