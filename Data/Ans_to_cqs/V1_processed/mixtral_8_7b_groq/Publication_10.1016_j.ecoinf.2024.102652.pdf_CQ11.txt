Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used to construct soil salinity maps. The article by El-Rawy et al. describes the process and methodology of using semantic segmentation with the MU-NET deep learning method for soil salinity mapping. However, it does not provide a specific link to a data repository for the pipeline.

The context does mention that remote sensing images are used as input for the deep learning model. These images could potentially be sourced from various repositories such as NASA's Earthdata, USGS Earth Explorer, or ESA's Copernicus Open Access Hub. However, these are general sources for remote sensing data and not specific to the data used in this study.

Additionally, the context provides information on the data preprocessing steps, network architecture, and training process for the deep learning pipeline. This information is useful for understanding the methodology but does not provide a link to a data repository.

In summary, based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study by El-Rawy et al. for constructing soil salinity maps.
