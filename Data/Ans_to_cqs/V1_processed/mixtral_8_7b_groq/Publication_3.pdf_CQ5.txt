The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline in the given context are not explicitly specified as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it is mentioned that the research involves the identification of animal species using a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow. The researchers used a dataset of animal bioacoustic recordings, which were transformed into spectrograms as input to the CNN. The dataset was obtained from Cornell Universityâ€™s Laboratory of Ornithology and Macaulay Library of Natural Sounds.

In the study, the researchers first evaluated the performance of the CNN on a dataset of 20 species, which were already present in the TensorFlow reference library. Then, they increased the number of species in the reference library to 41 by adding 21 new, undescribed species. They generated 20 spectrograms per species for this new dataset, resulting in a total of 440 spectrograms, to be subjected to identification using the CNN.

Therefore, the datasets used in this deep learning pipeline are specific to animal bioacoustic recordings and spectrograms, rather than the more general datasets commonly used in deep learning research, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
