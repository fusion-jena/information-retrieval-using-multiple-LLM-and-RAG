The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is inferred from the context provided, which mentions the use of the YOLOv8 algorithm. YOLOv8 is a family of object detection algorithms that are based on CNNs. Specifically, YOLOv8 uses a CNN as its backbone to extract features from input images, and then applies detection heads on top of the backbone to predict bounding boxes and class labels for objects in the image. The context also mentions the use of convolutional layers and a neck section that combines features from different levels of the network, which are both characteristic of CNN architectures. Therefore, it can be concluded that a CNN is used as the deep learning model in the pipeline.
