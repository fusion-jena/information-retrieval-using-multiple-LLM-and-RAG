Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, there are some implicit indications of data preprocessing methods used in specific studies.

In the study by Hofman et al. (2022), the authors preprocessed the spatiotemporal air quality data using a MinMaxScaler to transform each feature into a [0-1] range. This technique is used to standardize the data and prevent any feature from having disproportionate influence on the model due to differences in scales. However, this method does not directly address data bias.

In the study by Hengl et al. (2018), the authors used Random Forest as a generic predictive modeling framework for spatial and spatio-temporal variables. They mentioned the importance of having a diverse dataset for improving the model's performance. However, they did not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

In the context provided, it is not clear if there is any data bias present in the datasets used in these studies. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if any specific techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing.

However, some common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in a deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified sampling: This technique involves dividing the dataset into strata based on the distribution of the bias variable. Samples are then taken from each stratum to ensure that the training and testing sets have a similar distribution of the bias variable.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of samples from the minority class in the dataset to balance it with the majority class. This can help reduce bias in the model.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of samples from the majority class in the dataset to balance it with the minority class. This can help reduce bias in the model.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help reduce bias in the model by ensuring that it is trained on a diverse set of samples.


While the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, it is implicitly indicated that data preprocessing methods such as MinMaxScaler were used. However, there is no mention of any techniques used to address data bias. Common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
