Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in this particular study uses audio data as its primary input format. The audio data is processed using a software called Kaleidoscope, which identifies Regions of Interest (ROIs) in the audio recordings. These ROIs are then grouped into clusters of similar sounds using k-means clustering. The clusters are primarily composed of sounds from the same species, and the first ROIs of each cluster are the best examples of the sounds within that cluster.

The FFT window size is an essential parameter in this pipeline, and a larger FFT window size is used to improve the resolution at lower frequencies where cows vocalize. The pipeline also involves fitting cow-specific parameters in the model, which partly explains why the model detected a larger number of cow vocalizations compared to other studies.

The pipeline's performance is evaluated by measuring its recall rate and precision. The recall rate is estimated by dividing the number of cow calls detected by Kaleidoscope by the number of cow calls present in the sound recordings. This gives an index of the percentage of calls that the recognizer is able to detect.

Therefore, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is audio data. Other data formats such as CSV files are used for storing and manipulating parameters and results, but the core of the pipeline revolves around processing and analyzing audio data.
