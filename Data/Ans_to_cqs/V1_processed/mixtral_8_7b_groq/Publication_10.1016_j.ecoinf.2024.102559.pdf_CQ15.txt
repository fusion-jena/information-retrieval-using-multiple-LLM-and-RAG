The provided context does not include information about deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. The context mainly discusses machine learning, specifically the application of scikit-learn in Python, and the use of spectral, NDVI, and date features for land use and land cover classification.

In the context, there are tables presenting accuracies of models using different features and window sizes for classifying iceplant and other vegetation. However, there is no mention of optimization techniques used in deep learning.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about optimization techniques in deep learning pipelines.
