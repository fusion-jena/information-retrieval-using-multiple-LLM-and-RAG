The provided context discusses the use of deep learning and shallow learning techniques for classifying migrating birds' flight calls, but it does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation for the deep convolutional neural network model.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of a training dataset by creating new synthetic samples from the existing data. This can help to reduce overfitting, improve model generalization, and increase the robustness of the model. In the context of the paper, data augmentation was used for the deep convolutional neural network model by applying random time stretching and pitch shifting to the flight call audio recordings. This resulted in improved classification accuracy compared to the model without augmentation.

While data augmentation can help to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, it does not directly address data bias. Other techniques that can be used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves splitting the dataset into subsets based on the distribution of labels, and then randomly sampling from each subset to create the training, validation, and test sets. This can help to ensure that each set has a similar distribution of labels, reducing the risk of bias.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of samples from underrepresented classes in the dataset. This can help to balance the dataset and reduce bias.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of samples from overrepresented classes in the dataset. This can also help to balance the dataset and reduce bias.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help to reduce bias by ensuring that the dataset includes a diverse range of samples.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of data augmentation for the deep convolutional neural network model. Other techniques that can be used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
