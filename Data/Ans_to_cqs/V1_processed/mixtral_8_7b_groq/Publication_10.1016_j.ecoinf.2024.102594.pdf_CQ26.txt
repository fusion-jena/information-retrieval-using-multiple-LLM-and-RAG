The provided context does not directly mention the techniques used for addressing data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss some data preprocessing methods used in a specific study involving the DeepLabV3+ algorithm for land cover classification.

In the study, the authors addressed the challenge of feeding large-size images directly to the network by cutting all remote sensing images and semantic labels into a series of regular image blocks for input. This technique can be seen as a form of data preprocessing to handle large image sizes.

To maximize the sample size and maintain consistency with the cropping approach in the model prediction stage, the cropping size was set to 32 Ã— 32 pixels with a redundancy rate of 0.5. This method can be considered a form of data balancing, as it aims to ensure an adequate number of samples for each class.

Additionally, the training set was enhanced using data augmentation techniques, including flipping the images and labels along the X or Y axis, exchanging between multiple image channels while keeping the labels unchanged, randomly rotating the images and labels by 90 degrees, and randomly adding noise to the images while maintaining the labels unchanged. These techniques can help increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting.

However, the context does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling for addressing data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer this query comprehensively.
