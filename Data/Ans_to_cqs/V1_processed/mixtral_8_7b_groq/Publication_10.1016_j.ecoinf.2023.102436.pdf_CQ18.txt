Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the performance assessment of the landscape design is carried out iteratively throughout the design process.

In the context, three iterations of the park's design have been discussed, each focusing on different aspects such as increasing tree density and introducing water elements. After each iteration, the restorative potential of the design is evaluated, and the results are compared to the baseline. This implies that the performance of the model or design is being continuously monitored and compared against the desired objectives.

Moreover, the introduction mentions the use of a restorative map, which helps understand the design quality and aids in identifying strengths and weaknesses in the design. This suggests that the model's performance could be assessed based on how well the design meets the restorative potential criteria.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly describe the strategy for monitoring the model performance during training, it can be inferred that the model's performance is being continuously assessed and compared against the baseline and desired objectives throughout the iterative landscape design process.
