The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework or library was used to build the model. However, it is mentioned that automated hyperparameter tuning was implemented using bayesian optimization, and fastai's library for tabular data was used for predictive analytics. It is possible that the deep learning model was built using PyTorch, as fastai is a library for PyTorch, but this is not explicitly stated. Therefore, while we cannot definitively answer this question, it is likely that PyTorch was used in building the deep learning model.
