Based on the provided context, there are no specific regularization methods mentioned in the construction of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for pest damage identification. However, I can provide some general information about regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting.


Regularization methods are essential in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model learns the training data too well, negatively impacting its performance on unseen data. Two common regularization techniques are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization technique introduced by Geoffrey Hinton and his colleagues. During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction of the input units to zero, effectively preventing the network from relying too much on specific input units. This helps the model generalize better and reduces overfitting.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the model's weights. This encourages smaller weights during training, reducing the complexity of the model and preventing overfitting.

In the context of the provided study, the authors used a CNN model for pest damage identification. While they did not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization, it is possible that they employed one or both of these techniques to prevent overfitting. However, without explicit information from the study, it is impossible to confirm the use of these regularization methods.
