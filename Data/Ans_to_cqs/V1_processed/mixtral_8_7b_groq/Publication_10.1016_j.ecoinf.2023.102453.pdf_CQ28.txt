The provided context does not specify a particular platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform for deploying the deep learning model. Instead, it mentions the use of edge devices for model deployment, with a focus on the Raspberry Pi (RPi). The deep learning model is converted to TensorFlow Lite format for deployment on the RPi, allowing for classification of unseen images. Additionally, the RPi can run Explainable AI (XAI) techniques like Grad-CAM for generating visualizations through heatmaps. However, there is no information about cloud platforms being used in this context.
