The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training involved dividing the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing sets. The ratio used for this split was 80:10:10, meaning that 80% of the images were used for training, 10% for validation, and the remaining 10% for testing. This ratio was chosen based on prior evidence of superior performance in detecting small insects and diseases using deep learning models.

In this study, the training dataset consisted of 1543 images for the 640 × 640 pixels input resolution and 1637 images for the 1280 × 1280 pixels input resolution. The validation set contained 243 images for the 640 × 640 pixels input resolution and 255 images for the 1280 × 1280 pixels input resolution. Lastly, the testing set comprised 247 images for the 640 × 640 pixels input resolution and 262 images for the 1280 × 1280 pixels input resolution.

This data split strategy is essential for developing and evaluating the performance of deep learning models. The training set is used to optimize the model's parameters, the validation set is employed to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is utilized to assess the model's generalization performance on unseen data. By adhering to this data split criteria, the researchers aimed to ensure the robustness and reliability of the YOLOv5 models they trained for alate detection on sorghum leaves.
