The provided context does not explicitly mention the deep learning frameworks used to build the models. However, it does mention that GPU acceleration was used, which suggests that a popular deep learning library or framework compatible with GPUs was employed. Two of the models mentioned, ResNet-50 and InceptionV3, are available in both TensorFlow and PyTorch, which are two of the most widely used deep learning frameworks. InceptionResNetV2 is also available in both TensorFlow and PyTorch. Therefore, it's plausible that either TensorFlow or PyTorch was used to build the models, but the exact framework cannot be determined from the given context.
