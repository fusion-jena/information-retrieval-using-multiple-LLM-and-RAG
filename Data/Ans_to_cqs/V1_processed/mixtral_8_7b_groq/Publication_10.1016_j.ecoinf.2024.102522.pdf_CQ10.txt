Based on the provided information, there is no direct mention of a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The articles do not provide a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repositories.

However, it is mentioned that the data will be made available on request. It is possible that the code may also be shared upon request, but this is not explicitly stated.

Additionally, the CRediT authorship contribution statement mentions that Jiangxia Ye contributed to the software and methodology, and Wenbin Quan contributed to the investigation and software. This suggests that they may have developed the deep learning pipeline used in the study. It might be helpful to contact the authors directly to inquire about the code repository.

Another approach could be to look for the articles on the journal's website or the preprint server (e.g., arXiv) to see if there is any additional information provided. Sometimes, authors provide links to code repositories or supplementary materials on these platforms.

In summary, while there is no direct mention of a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study, it may be possible to obtain the code by contacting the authors directly or looking for additional information on the journal's website or preprint server.
