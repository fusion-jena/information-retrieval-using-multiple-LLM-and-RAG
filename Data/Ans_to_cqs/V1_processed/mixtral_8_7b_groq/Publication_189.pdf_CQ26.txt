The provided context discusses various topics related to deep learning, computer vision, and data collection, but it does not directly mention techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing. However, it does provide information on data collection and annotation that can be used to infer some methods for reducing data bias.

Data bias can occur when the training data does not accurately represent the entire population, leading to poor model performance and unfair predictions. To address data bias, it is crucial to ensure that the data is diverse and representative of the target population.

In the context [26], Chang and Lin present LIBSVM, a library for Support Vector Machines, which is a popular algorithm for classification tasks. While LIBSVM does not directly address data bias, it provides a tool for building accurate models given a dataset.

Context [27] by Poojary et al. discusses the impact of data augmentation on fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. Data augmentation is a technique that can help increase the diversity of the training data by applying random transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping) to the existing images. This can help reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Context [28] introduces the IKKAKU Project, which focuses on developing vision-based AI systems. Although it does not explicitly mention data bias, the project emphasizes the importance of collecting high-quality, diverse data for training deep learning models.

Context [12] by Wu et al. presents FastFCN, a backbone for semantic segmentation tasks. The authors argue that dilated convolutions can help capture a larger context without increasing the computational cost. This can be useful for addressing data bias by allowing the model to learn more robust features from a diverse set of images.

Context [13] by He et al. introduces Mask R-CNN, a popular deep learning architecture for object detection and instance segmentation tasks. Mask R-CNN combines Faster R-CNN and FCN models with some advancements, including a parallel layer of FCN for mask implementation and extra convolutional layers for each Region of Interest (RoI). These advancements can help improve the model's ability to handle diverse and complex data.

Context [14] by Ronneberger et al. presents U-Net, a deep learning architecture for biomedical image segmentation. U-Net uses a unique architecture with skip connections between the encoder and decoder parts, allowing the model to learn more precise features from a diverse set of images.

Context [20] by Zhao and Ren discusses a region of interest extraction method based on Convolutional Neural Networks for image linear distortion correction. Although not directly related to data bias, this method can help improve data quality by correcting image distortions, leading to more accurate models.

Context [21] introduces the Computer Vision Annotation Tool, a universal approach to data annotation. Annotating data is an essential step in reducing data bias, as it ensures that the data is labeled correctly and represents the target population.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing, it does discuss methods for increasing data diversity and quality, such as data augmentation, dilated convolutions, and accurate data annotation. These techniques can help reduce data bias and improve deep learning model performance.
