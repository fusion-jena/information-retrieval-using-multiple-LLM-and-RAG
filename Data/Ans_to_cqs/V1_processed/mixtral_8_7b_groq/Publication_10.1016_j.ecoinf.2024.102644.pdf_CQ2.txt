Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in this particular study uses CSV (Comma Separated Values) data format. This is evident in the processing of species observation data obtained from a public authoritative repository of big data (GBIF), which was improved with reliable records they accurately and directly observed in the field. After applying the data pre-processing algorithm, they obtained 17 datasets, one each for ET, WS, C, seven for T, and seven for P. These datasets were then used as proxy environmental conditions for annual environmental snapshots in the years 1950, 1999, 2016, 2050, and 2100 under the RCP4.5 and 8.5 scenarios for the last two years. However, there is no mention of other data formats such as image, audio, or video in the given context.
