Based on the provided context, there is no information that specifies the platform used to deploy the deep learning model, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The text focuses on the methodology and data sources used for seagrass detection in the Mediterranean, but it does not mention the deployment platform for the machine learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
