The provided context does not give specific information about the data repository of a particular deep learning pipeline for animal biodiversity modeling. However, it does mention a few resources and studies related to the use of unmanned aircraft systems, automated bioacoustic recorders, and deep learning in wildlife research.

In the study "Modelling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring and deep learning" by Chalmers et al. (2021), the authors mention the use of deep learning for species identification from audio recordings but do not specify the data repository.

The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (2019) advisory circular provides guidelines for the safe operation of unmanned aircraft systems, but it does not mention data repositories.

Corcoran et al. (2021) evaluate drone surveys for biodiversity monitoring and discuss the importance of data sharing and open access but do not specify a data repository for deep learning pipelines.

Zwart et al. (2014) investigate useful bioindicators of mining and grazing impacts in Arid South Australia, but their study does not involve deep learning or data repositories.

The RStudio Team (2020) discusses the use of automated bioacoustic recorders to replace human wildlife surveys, but they do not mention deep learning or data repositories.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query regarding the data repository of a deep learning pipeline for animal biodiversity modeling. I would recommend checking the papers and resources mentioned in the context for more information or contacting the authors directly.
