Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the described deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the architecture of the convolutional neural network (CNN) used for bird species recognition, the feature selection process, and the comparison of the proposed model with a classic CNN model. However, it does not specify any details about data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query from the given context.
