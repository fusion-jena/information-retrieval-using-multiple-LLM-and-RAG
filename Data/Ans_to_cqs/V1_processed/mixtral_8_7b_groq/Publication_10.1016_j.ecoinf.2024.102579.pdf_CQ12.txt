Based on the provided context, there is no information that suggests a deep learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer, is used in the pipeline. The context discusses the use of inventory estimators, specifically the NN1 and NN2 estimators, in the context of continuous forest cover and ecological informatics. These estimators are not deep learning models.

The NN1 and NN2 estimators are methods for estimating forest attributes, such as tree height and diameter at breast height (DBH), based on sample data. These estimators are explicitly corrected for plot and survey data, as mentioned in the context.

The inventory estimator, which is referred to in the context, is a general formula for estimating forest attributes based on sample data. It is not a deep learning model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is unlikely that a deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
