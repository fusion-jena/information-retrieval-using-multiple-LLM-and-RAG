Based on the provided context, the text does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for biodiversity. However, it does mention that deep learning is used to detect and classify events of interest and reduce the amount of wildlife data reviewed by human analysts.

In general, for object detection and classification tasks in deep learning, data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation are commonly used.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image. This technique is useful for training object detection models, where the goal is to locate and classify objects within an image.

Instance segmentation, on the other hand, involves segmenting each instance of an object in an image and labeling it separately. This technique is more precise than bounding box annotation and is useful for training models that need to understand the shape and appearance of objects in detail.

In the context of biodiversity monitoring, these techniques could be used to annotate images or video streams captured by sensors to train deep learning models to detect and classify different species of wildlife. For example, a deep learning model could be trained to detect and classify different species of birds based on images or video streams annotated with bounding boxes or instance segmentation masks.

Overall, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for biodiversity, it is likely that techniques such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation are used in practice.
