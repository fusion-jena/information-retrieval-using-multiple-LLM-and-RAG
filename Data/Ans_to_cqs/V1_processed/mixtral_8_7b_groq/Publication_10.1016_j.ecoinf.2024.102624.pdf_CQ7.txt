The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it does discuss the data splitting and accuracy assessment methods used for machine learning models, specifically for RF, SVM, and MARS classifiers.

In the given context, the reference dataset was split into training and testing sets at a 70:30 ratio. During the model building phase, a 10-fold cross-validation with three repetitions was applied using the training dataset. The training dataset was randomly split into 10 folds, with 9 folds used for model training and 1 fold for testing. This procedure was repeated until all folds were used as testing data, and the whole sequence was repeated using two new random splits.

The purpose of this approach was to find the best models with the largest overall accuracy (OA) and reflect the distribution of possible model outcomes (OAs) with minimums, maximums, quartiles, and medians. A smaller range of possible model outcomes indicates a more reliable prediction.

Additionally, the context discusses data augmentation, which extends the existing training data to enhance the generalization capabilities. Post-classification techniques, such as segmentation and filtering, can provide better maps with a lower rate of salt-and-pepper errors. Strategies like excluding outliers, refining training samples, or changing the proportion of training and test data can collectively improve classification accuracy.

While these methods are not specific to deep learning, they generally apply to various machine learning techniques, including deep learning. In deep learning, data splitting criteria are similar, with the dataset being divided into train, test, and validation sets. The train set is used for model training, the test set for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data, and the validation set for tuning hyperparameters and preventing overfitting.

In summary, although the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it discusses data splitting and accuracy assessment methods for machine learning models. These methods can generally be applied to deep learning as well, with the dataset being divided into train, test, and validation sets for model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
