The provided context discusses a study on a new computational setting for regression where target labels are structurally incomplete, as well as different methods for handling artificially incomplete data. However, it does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data that may not generalize well to new, unseen data.

Dropout is a regularization technique commonly used in deep learning models, such as neural networks. It works by randomly dropping out, or setting to zero, a fraction of the neurons in each layer during training. This helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons and encouraging the model to learn more robust features.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is another regularization technique that adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the model's weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which can help to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.

In summary, while the provided context discusses various methods for handling artificially incomplete data in a structurally incomplete target label setting, it does not mention any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization are important techniques for preventing overfitting in deep learning models and improving their generalization performance.
