Based on the provided context, the performance of a model is evaluated using four parameters: coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), ratio of performance to deviation (RPD), and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ). However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of accuracy, precision, or recall to evaluate the performance of a model.

In the context, R2 is used to measure the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable. RMSE is used to measure the difference between values predicted by a model and the values actually observed. RPD is calculated as the ratio of standard deviation (SD) to RMSE, and RPIQ considers prediction errors and variations in observations simultaneously, providing a more objective and easily comparable measure of model validity.

The context provides an example of evaluating the performance of a model for estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations. The SVMR model displayed good model accuracy for estimating SOC (R2cv = 0.92, RMSEcv = 0.80) and excellent model accuracy for estimating TN (R2cv = 0.92, RMSEcv = 0.06). The SVMR model outperformed the PLSR model for estimating both SOC and TN concentrations.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the performance of a deep learning model can be evaluated using R2, RMSE, RPD, and RPIQ. However, the context does not mention the use of accuracy, precision, or recall to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model.
