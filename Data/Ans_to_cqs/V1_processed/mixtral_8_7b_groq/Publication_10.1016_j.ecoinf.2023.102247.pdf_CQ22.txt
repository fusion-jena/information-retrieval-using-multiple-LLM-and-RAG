The provided context does not give information about a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the use of an ensemble modeling approach in the BIOMOD2 package in R to predict the distribution of a study species. The performance of this ensemble model is evaluated using the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC). AUC is a scale that ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, where a higher AUC value indicates a more accurate model. Therefore, the metric used to evaluate the performance of the model in this context is AUC.
