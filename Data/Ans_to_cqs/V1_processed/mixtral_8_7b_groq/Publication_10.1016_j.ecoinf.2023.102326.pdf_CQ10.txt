The provided context does not contain information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses complex network measures, specifically the Average Shortest Path Length (ASPL), in the context of land use types and their R2-Thresholds. The ASPL and its standard deviation are presented for two land use types, Commercial Area and Urban Forest, in Table B1. Figure C1 shows 95% Bootstrap intervals of the ASPL for each hour by device. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or its code repository link.
