Based on the provided context, the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model for generating synthetic connectivity data are not explicitly mentioned. The text discusses the use of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model and compares the original and synthetic connectivity data using a quality score, visual comparisons of pairwise correlations, and visual comparisons of correlation matrices. However, it does not refer to standard deep learning evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall.

The Ï‡2test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, correlations scores, mean data quality score, and mean data diagnostics scores are mentioned in the context, but these are related to data utility and not directly tied to the evaluation of the deep learning model's performance.

It is important to note that the selection of evaluation metrics depends on the specific problem and the nature of the data. In the context of evaluating generative models for relational data like connectivity data, custom evaluation metrics might be more appropriate than standard deep learning evaluation metrics.

In summary, while the provided context discusses the evaluation of synthetic connectivity data generated by a deep learning model, it does not specify the use of standard deep learning evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall.
