Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, particularly in terms of model serialization and platform selection.

However, it is mentioned that the study utilized a training-and-test approach with stratification splitting, where the data was split into 100 different training-and-test sets for each setting. The hyperparameter tuning was done for each set, followed by model training using an optimal setting of the hyperparameter. This process was repeated for four methods: AdaBoost, random decision forest (RF), multilayer neural network (NET), and Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes).

Given that the study used a multilayer neural network, a type of deep learning model, it can be inferred that the model training process involved training the neural network using the optimal hyperparameter setting. However, the details of the model deployment process, such as model serialization and platform selection, are not provided in the context.

Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model to a file, allowing it to be loaded and used for making predictions on new data. Platform selection refers to choosing the appropriate hardware or software environment for deploying the model, such as a local machine, cloud-based platform, or edge device.

Therefore, while the context provides information on the training process for the deep learning model, it does not explicitly mention the steps taken for model serialization and platform selection.
