Unfortunately, the context provided does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text describes the methods and results of a study that uses a deep learning model called BatNet to identify tropical bat species from audio files, but it does not provide a link to the code repository. It mentions the use of three Python scripts (Coverting_image.py, Making_database.py, and Training.py) in a self-developed open-source software called Waveman, but it does not give the repository link for Waveman either. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
