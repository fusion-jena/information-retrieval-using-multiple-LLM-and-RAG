The provided context does not include specific information on how the hyperparameters of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model were optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other method for hyperparameter tuning. The context focuses on describing the dataset, the model architecture, and the application of the model in a sliding window fashion for real-time detection. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
