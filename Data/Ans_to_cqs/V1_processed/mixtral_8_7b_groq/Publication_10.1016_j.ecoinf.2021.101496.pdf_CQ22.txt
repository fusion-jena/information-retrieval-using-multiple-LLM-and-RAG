The performance of the deep learning model, an artificial neural network (ANN), is evaluated using residuals, mean deviance, and mean absolute deviance. These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of the ANN in predicting SPAD values based on the Rasp2SPAD indices.

Residuals are the differences between the actual SPAD values and the predicted SPAD values obtained from the ANN. The analysis of residuals from 100 successful runs of the ANN model provides a more reliable evaluation of the model performance.

Mean deviance is the average of the absolute differences between the predicted SPAD values and the actual SPAD values. A lower mean deviance indicates a better fit of the model. In this case, the mean deviance of the model response from SPAD value measurements was 1.904 (95% CI: 1.89--1.92).

Mean absolute deviance is the average of the absolute differences between the predicted SPAD values and the actual SPAD values, without taking the sign into account. A lower mean absolute deviance indicates a better fit of the model. In this case, the best "run" of the ANN model showed a mean absolute deviation of 1.70 (max. 2.22, 95% CI, one-sided t-test).

It is important to note that traditional metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. These metrics are commonly used for classification problems, while the ANN model in this case is used for regression analysis, predicting continuous SPAD values.
