Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of various pre-trained models, such as ResNet-50, Inception-V3, and CLIP, as well as the fine-tuning process using HuggingFace and Keras implementations. However, it does not mention where the code for this pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
