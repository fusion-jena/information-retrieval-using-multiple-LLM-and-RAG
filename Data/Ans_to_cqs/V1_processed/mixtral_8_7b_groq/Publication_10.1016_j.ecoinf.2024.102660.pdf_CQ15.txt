The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the learning rate was adjusted using the StepLR strategy, which is a learning rate scheduler in PyTorch. StepLR halves the original learning rate every 10 epochs of iteration.

The initial learning rate was set to 0.001. This suggests that some form of gradient descent was used, as the learning rate is a parameter specific to gradient descent and its variants. The most common optimization techniques in deep learning are Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), RMSprop, and Adam. Given the information provided, it is not possible to definitively say which of these techniques was used. However, it is clear that a form of learning rate adjustment was used to improve the training process.

Another optimization technique mentioned in the context is the use of residual structures and the reduction of convolutional kernels within each block. These techniques are not optimization techniques in the traditional sense (i.e., they do not affect the optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function), but they can improve the training process by mitigating overfitting and improving the network's ability to capture semantic features.

In summary, while the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is clear that some form of learning rate adjustment was used. Additionally, other techniques such as residual structures and reduced convolutional kernels were used to improve the training process.
