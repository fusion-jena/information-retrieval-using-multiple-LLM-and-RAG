Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning model with specific hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. The models mentioned in the context are all related to machine learning, not deep learning. These models include TKNN, TRF, TAdaBoost, TXGBoost, TLightGBM, RF, and RFECV. Therefore, I cannot provide the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model as there is no deep learning model mentioned in the given context.
