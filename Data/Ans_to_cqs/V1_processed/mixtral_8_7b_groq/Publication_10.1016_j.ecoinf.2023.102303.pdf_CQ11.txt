I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the data repository link for the FishInTurbidWater dataset or the deep learning pipeline. The context gives details about the collection and labeling of the dataset, as well as the development of two novel deep learning models. However, it does not specify where the dataset or the code for the deep learning pipeline can be found. Therefore, I am unable to provide the data repository link for this information.
