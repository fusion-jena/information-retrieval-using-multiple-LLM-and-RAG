The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the models were trained using a processing platform that could evaluate images with a resolution of 224 Ã— 224 pixels in real time using ResNet50-v2. This suggests that the training was possibly done on a machine with a GPU, as ResNet50-v2 is a resource-intensive model and achieving real-time evaluation on a CPU would be challenging. Additionally, the models were trained using Keras, a high-level API based on Tensorflow, which is a popular deep learning framework that supports GPU and TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) acceleration. Therefore, it is plausible that GPUs or TPUs were used for training, but the context does not provide explicit information to confirm this.
