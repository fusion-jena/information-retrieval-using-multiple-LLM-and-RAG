The provided context discusses the architecture and methods used to improve a simple CNN model for species classification using spectrogram inputs. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer.

In general, hyperparameters are crucial components of a deep learning model that can significantly impact the training process and the final model's performance. Common hyperparameters include the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, and regularization techniques.

In the context provided, the authors mention that they explored and tested different methods to enhance the neural network with contextual information. They used a multi-branch CNN approach, which could involve different hyperparameters for each branch. However, the specific hyperparameters used in their experiments are not provided.

Furthermore, the authors mention that they trained and tested the models, but they do not specify the training details, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or batch size. They only mention that they used a spectrogram input and a probability output for each of the 22 species.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
