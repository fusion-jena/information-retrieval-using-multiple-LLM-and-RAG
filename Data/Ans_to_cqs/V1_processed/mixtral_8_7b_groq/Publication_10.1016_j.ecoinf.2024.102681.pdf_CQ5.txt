Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that a comprehensive dataset was compiled for this study on drought propagation. This dataset includes various influencing factors and an extensive drought propagation time series, spanning from January 1950 to December 2020. By employing a sliding window method, forty-two distinct datasets were generated, each corresponding to a separate Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) time scale.

The study uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in combination with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, creating a CNN-LSTM hybrid model. While the context does not specify the use of standard deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it does reference the use of the SPEI dataset for drought analysis.
