In the context of deep learning for wildlife population estimation using aerial surveys, there are two primary methods for collecting raw data: surveys using specialized sensors and public datasets.

The first method involves conducting aerial surveys using specialized sensors to capture images or videos of the survey area. For instance, Remote Sensing (RS) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) are two common sensors used for this purpose (Tuia et al., 2022). Researchers have used these sensors to generate thousands of images covering thousands of square kilometers for wildlife conservation (Tuia et al., 2022). However, surveys using the OCC approach can be delayed by several months due to the slow manual processing of images (Tuia et al., 2022).

To address the challenges associated with manual processing, recent advances in machine learning have propelled the prospects of automating image processing from SRF-OCC surveys (Delplanque et al., 2023b; Eikelboom et al., 2019). Deep learning (DL), a subgroup of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), has been widely employed to (semi-)automate the detection and counting of wildlife using aerial surveys (Lamprey et al., 2020a; Remote Sens. Environ. 216, 139–153).

The second method for collecting raw data involves using public datasets. For example, Lamprey et al. (2020a) used publicly available camera trap images to train a deep learning model for multi-species wildlife population estimation. Public datasets can provide a large amount of data for training deep learning models, which is essential for achieving accurate results.

In summary, aerial surveys using specialized sensors and public datasets are the two primary methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for wildlife population estimation. While surveys can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, recent advances in machine learning have provided promising prospects for automating image processing. Public datasets can also provide a large amount of data for training deep learning models, which is crucial for achieving accurate results.
