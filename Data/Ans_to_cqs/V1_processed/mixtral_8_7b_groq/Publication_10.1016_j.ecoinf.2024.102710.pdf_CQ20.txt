Based on the provided context, the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that the pre-processing and active learning experiments were conducted using an Intel® Core™ i7-1165G7 CPU and 32 GB of RAM. There is no information given about the use of GPUs, TPUs, or any other type of accelerator hardware. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning models were trained using a CPU, but the potential use of additional accelerator hardware cannot be ruled out based solely on the provided information.
