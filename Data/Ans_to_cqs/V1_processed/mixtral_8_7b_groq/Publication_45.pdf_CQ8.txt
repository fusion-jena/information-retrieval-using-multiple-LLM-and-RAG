The code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study titled "Deep Learning for Predictive Ecology" is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is noted that the study provides a reproducible example of designing, training, and applying deep neural networks (DNNs) for ecological prediction using bark beetle outbreaks in conifer forests. It is possible that the code used in this study is included in the supplementary materials provided with the publication or hosted on an online repository. It would be best to contact the authors of the study or check the publication details for more information on the code repository.
