The provided context does not specify the use of a deep learning model for estimating Volumetric Water Content (VWC) on a reclaimed spoil heap. The model developed in the study is an integration of remote sensing data (PlanetScope satellite imagery) and topographic indices, and the method used for estimating the model parameters is not specified as a deep learning approach.

The model accuracy evaluation parameters provided, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2), are commonly used for evaluating the performance of predictive models, but they do not provide information on the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.

Deep learning models have several hyperparameters that need to be tuned for optimal performance, such as learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, and activation function. The choice of these hyperparameters depends on the specific deep learning model being used and the dataset being analyzed.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot provide the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for estimating VWC on a reclaimed spoil heap. However, it is mentioned that in the future, more advanced methods of data analysis, including various methods of machine learning or deep neural networks, could be tested to increase the accuracy of prediction.
