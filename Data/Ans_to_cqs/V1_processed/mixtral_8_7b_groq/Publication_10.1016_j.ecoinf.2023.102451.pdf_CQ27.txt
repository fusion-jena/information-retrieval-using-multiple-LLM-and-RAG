The context provided does not give a detailed description of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was implemented using TensorFlow 2.2.0 and Keras 2.4.0, which are popular deep learning libraries in Python. Therefore, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized using one of the serialization methods provided by these libraries, such as the `save()` function in Keras.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model was trained and tested on a specific operating system, processor, and amount of RAM. This suggests that the model was developed and trained on a local machine, rather than in a cloud-based environment. However, the context does not provide information on whether the model was deployed on the same machine or on a different platform.

In summary, while the context provides some information on the development and training of the deep learning model, it does not give a detailed description of the deployment process. It can be inferred that the model was likely serialized using a function provided by TensorFlow or Keras, but the platform on which it was deployed is not specified.
