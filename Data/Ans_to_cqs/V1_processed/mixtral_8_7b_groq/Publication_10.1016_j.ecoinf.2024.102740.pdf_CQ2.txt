The provided context discusses a study that uses remote sensing images for grassland analysis, specifically Sentinel-2 Level 2A bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance products. However, it does not mention any deep learning techniques or other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV.

The Sentinel-2 data is atmospherically and radiometrically corrected and then processed using QGIS software, System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) software, and the Sentinels Application Platform (SNAP) for image resampling and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) computation.

Therefore, based on the given context, the data format used in the pipeline is remote sensing images in the form of Sentinel-2 Level 2A bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance products.
