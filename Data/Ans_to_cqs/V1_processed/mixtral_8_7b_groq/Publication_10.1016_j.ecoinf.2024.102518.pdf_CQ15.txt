Based on the provided context, there is no information suggesting that traditional deep learning optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam were directly applied in the specified machine learning pipeline. Instead, the text focuses on the optimization of a MaxEnt model, a popular machine learning tool for species distribution modeling, using different feature classes and regularization multipliers.

The researchers used the Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) and the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) to determine the best tuning parameters for the MaxEnt model. AICc was employed to compare different models, and the optimal model was the one with the minimum delta.AICc value (delta.AICc = 0). A model with delta.AICc < 2 was considered credible. Additionally, the CBI index was used alongside the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) to assess model performance.

The researchers then identified the key input variables for the final model using percent contribution and permutation importance metrics provided by MaxEnt. These metrics helped determine the importance of input variables in the final model.

In summary, the provided context discusses the optimization of a MaxEnt model for species distribution modeling using the AICc, CBI, percent contribution, and permutation importance metrics. Traditional deep learning optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam were not mentioned in the given text.
