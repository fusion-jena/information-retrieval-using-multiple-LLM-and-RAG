The raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected using various sensor models. According to the provided context, the temperature and humidity sensor model is HMP155, manufactured by Vaisala Inc., Finland. This sensor has a temperature measurement range of -80 to 60°C and a humidity measurement range of 0-100%. The wind speed sensor is a WindSonic anemometer from Gill Inc., UK, with a measurement range of 0-60 m/s. The atmospheric pressure sensor model is AV-410BP from Avalon Inc., USA, with a measurement range of 600-1100 hPa. The photosynthetically active radiation sensor model is LI-190SB from Licor Inc., USA, with a measurement range of 400-700 nm. The direct radiation sensor model is LI-200× from Licor Inc., USA, with a measurement range of 400-1100 nm. The ultraviolet radiation sensor model is CUV5 from Kipp zonen Inc., Netherlands, with a measurement range of 210-380 nm. The net radiation sensor model is CNR4 from Kipp zonen Inc., Netherlands, with a measurement range of 300-2800 nm. The particulate matter 2.5 sensor model is RR-9421 from Rainroot Inc., China. These sensors are installed 0.2 m below the soil, and the data is stored by a CR1000 collector with a sampling frequency of 15 s/time and a storage period of 10 min. The data is then automatically transmitted in real-time to the server through the DTU900C GPRS remote transmission module. Therefore, the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected using various sensor models, and the data collection process involves sensor installation, data storage, and real-time data transmission.
