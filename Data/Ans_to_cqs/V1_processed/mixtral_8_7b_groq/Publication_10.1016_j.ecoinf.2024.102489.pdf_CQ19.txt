The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Instead, it focuses on the Random Forest (RF) model and the SCS + C terrain correction model.

The RF model is a machine learning algorithm based on classification trees that is widely used in regression and classification. It is known for its high tolerance for noisy datasets, low computational overhead, and high interpretability. The SCS + C terrain correction model is used to ensure the quality of training samples for machine learning methods, including RF models.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the frameworks used to build the deep learning model.
