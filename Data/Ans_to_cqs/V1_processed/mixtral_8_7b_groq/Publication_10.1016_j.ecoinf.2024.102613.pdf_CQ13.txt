Based on the provided context, there are several sources that discuss the use of deep learning models in the contexts of smart farming and ecological monitoring. However, none of the sources explicitly list the hyperparameters used in their deep learning models.

In the 2023 paper by Liu et al., they developed a deep residual convolutional neural network based on a hybrid attention mechanism for ecological monitoring of marine fishery. While they provide a detailed description of the network architecture, they do not specify the hyperparameters used in training the model.

Similarly, in the 2017 paper by LÃ³pez-Riquelme et al., they proposed a software architecture based on FIWARE cloud for precision agriculture. They mentioned the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques for data analysis, but they did not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in their models.

In the context of smart farming, hyperparameters that are commonly used in deep learning models include learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and choice of optimizer. The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. The batch size determines the number of samples to work through before updating the model's weights. The number of epochs determines the number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset. The choice of optimizer can include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSprop, among others.

Therefore, while the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models mentioned in the provided context are not explicitly stated, it is common practice to tune these hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.
