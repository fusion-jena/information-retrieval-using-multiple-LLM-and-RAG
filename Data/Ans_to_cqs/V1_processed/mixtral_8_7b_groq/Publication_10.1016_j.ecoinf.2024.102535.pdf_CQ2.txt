The deep learning pipeline for substratum classification in hydrothermal vent environments, as described in the work of Soto Vega et al. (n.d.), primarily uses imagery data. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in this specific pipeline.

The pipeline involves processing deep-sea images, which are used to train and test the deep learning models for substratum classification. The models are designed to identify and label different substratum types in the hydrothermal vent environments.

The authors mention using various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, such as U-Net (Song et al., 2019), VGG16 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015), and other custom CNN architectures. These CNN models are specifically designed to handle image data formats, such as JPEG or PNG, for training and testing the models.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline for substratum classification in hydrothermal vent environments, as presented in the work of Soto Vega et al. (n.d.), primarily uses imagery data (JPEG or PNG format) as the input data format. There is no explicit mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in this pipeline.
