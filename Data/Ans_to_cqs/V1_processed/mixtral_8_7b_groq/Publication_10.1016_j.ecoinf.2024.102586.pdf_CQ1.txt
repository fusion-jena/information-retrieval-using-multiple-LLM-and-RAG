The study does not provide specific details about the deep learning pipeline or the methods used for collecting raw data in that pipeline. However, it does describe the data sources used for analyzing the richness and abundance of invasive alien species in a region. These data sources include:

1. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) for environmental and climatic data, such as maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, and soil temperature.
2. OpenLandMap for soil water content, soil organic carbon content, and soil pH in H2O.
3. Lembrechts et al., 2020 for topographic data, such as elevation.
4. GTOPO30 for slope and aspect.
5. Weiss et al., 2018 for distance to city and human population density.
6. Gridded Population of the World Version 4 (GPWv4) for anthropogenic data.

It can be inferred from this information that the study utilizes a combination of public datasets, surveys, and sensors to collect raw data. The IMD provides climate data collected through sensors and surveys, while OpenLandMap and GTOPO30 provide soil and topographic data collected through remote sensing technologies. Lembrechts et al., 2020 and Weiss et al., 2018 provide specific topographic and distance data, while Gridded Population of the World Version 4 (GPWv4) provides anthropogenic data collected through surveys and population censuses.

Therefore, while the study does not provide specific details about the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that the raw data for the study is collected through a combination of public datasets, surveys, and sensors.
