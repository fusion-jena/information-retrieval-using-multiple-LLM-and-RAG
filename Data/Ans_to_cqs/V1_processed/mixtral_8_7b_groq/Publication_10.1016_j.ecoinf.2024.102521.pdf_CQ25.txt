The deep learning models in the context provided serve the purpose of object detection and taxonomic classification in the field of arthropod research.

In the STARdbi system, deep learning models are used for object detection, which allows users to identify and count insects in images. These models enable the automatic detection of insects, eliminating the need for manual counting and providing a more efficient and accurate method for insect population estimation. Additionally, the object detection models can morphologically characterize insects, providing further insights into insect diversity and behavior.

Furthermore, deep learning models are utilized for taxonomic classification in STARdbi. These models are custom-made and trained on manually labeled insect data, with the aim of gradually building a set of high-resolution classifiers for insect identification. The performance of a task-specific classifier is presented in the Results section as a case study, demonstrating the potential of AI-based classification models in arthropod research.

The Wang et al. (2020) study introduces the Pest24 dataset, which is a large-scale very small object data set of agricultural pests for multi-target detection. This dataset can be used to train deep learning models for object detection and classification of agricultural pests, contributing to the development of AI-based tools for pest management and control.

In summary, the deep learning models in the provided context serve the purpose of object detection and taxonomic classification in arthropod research, enabling efficient and accurate insect identification, population estimation, and morphological characterization. These models contribute to the advancement of ecological research on arthropods through computer vision and provide valuable tools for pest management and conservation efforts.
