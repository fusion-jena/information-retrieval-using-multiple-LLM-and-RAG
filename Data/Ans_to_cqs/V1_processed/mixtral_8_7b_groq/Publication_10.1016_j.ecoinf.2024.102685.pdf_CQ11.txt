Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of a deep learning pipeline or a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context focuses on the use of Random Forest, a machine learning method, for mapping seagrass habitats. However, it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
