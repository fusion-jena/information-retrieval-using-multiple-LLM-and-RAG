In the context provided, the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset is used for the pretraining weights of the proposed deep learning model. This dataset is split into two parts: one for training and the other for testing and validation. The specific criteria or ratio for this split are not explicitly mentioned in the text. However, it is common practice in deep learning to allocate 80% of the data for training and the remaining 20% for testing and validation. This 80-20 split is not specified in the text, but it's a general convention in the field.

Furthermore, the text also mentions the PlantVillage dataset, which is used for illustrative purposes. This dataset is divided into three parts: training, testing, and validation, with 60% for training, 20% for testing, and 20% for validation. This is a different split ratio from the one potentially used for the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset, but it demonstrates that the authors are following the standard practice of dividing the dataset into these three parts.

In conclusion, while the exact criteria for splitting the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset are not provided, the authors' use of the PlantVillage dataset and their general approach suggest that they are following common practice in deep learning, which involves splitting the dataset into a training set and a testing/validation set. The specific ratio used for the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset is not clear from the text, but an 80-20 split would be consistent with typical approaches in the field.
