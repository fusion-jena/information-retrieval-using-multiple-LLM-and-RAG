The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of a learning and testing procedure for the monitoring system. During the learning stage, features are extracted from the training dataset using a feature extraction algorithm, and the model is trained using these features. After the training is completed, the trained model is then used to predict water conditions and analyze performance using a test dataset that was not employed during the learning stage. This allows for an evaluation of how well the model has learned to generalize from the training data to new, unseen data.

Additionally, the performance of the proposed methods is evaluated using four performance metrics: accuracy, recall, precision, and the F1 score. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of its strengths and weaknesses.

Furthermore, the use of a dropout layer during training helps to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize. The dropout rate of 50% means that, during training, each element of the output vectors from the LSTM layers has a 50% chance of being dropped, or set to zero. This helps to ensure that the model does not become too reliant on any one feature or pattern in the training data, and is able to learn more robust representations of the data.

Lastly, the authors aimed to design the model structure as simply as possible, while still maintaining good performance. This was done to ensure the usability of the model on devices with limited computing power, and to enable real-time predictions. The model structure consists of an input layer, three LSTM hidden layers, one dropout layer, and one dense layer. This simple structure allows for easy monitoring of the model's performance during training, as there are few components that could potentially cause issues or unexpected behavior.

In summary, the strategy for monitoring the model performance during training involves the use of a learning and testing procedure, performance metrics, a dropout layer to prevent overfitting, and a simple model structure. These elements allow for a thorough evaluation of the model's performance, and help to ensure that the model is able to generalize well to new, unseen data.
