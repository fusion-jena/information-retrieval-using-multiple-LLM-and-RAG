The provided context discusses the use of Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite imagery in the context of wildfire severity classification using machine learning (ML) and deep learning techniques. However, it does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.

Based on the context, we can infer that the deep learning pipeline likely uses processed S2 satellite images as input data. S2 imagery typically comes in the form of multispectral image data, where each pixel value represents the reflectance intensity of different spectral bands. This data format can be considered a multichannel image format, similar to RGB images but with more spectral bands.

The context also mentions the use of synthetic spectral databases, which are likely created from linear spectral mixing. These databases might be used to augment the original S2 imagery dataset, providing more training data for the deep learning models.

However, the context does not provide information on other data formats, such as audio, video, or CSV files. Therefore, we cannot definitively say that these data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in this wildfire severity classification study most likely uses processed S2 satellite imagery as input data. Other data formats, such as audio, video, or CSV files, are not mentioned in the provided context.
