The provided context does not contain specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this study. However, it does mention the use of a geographic information system (GIS) and various socio-economic data, which could be used in conjunction with deep learning techniques for spatial analysis and prediction. Common data annotation techniques for deep learning in computer vision include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and panoptic segmentation. These techniques help to label and categorize objects within images or video frames, enabling deep learning models to learn and make predictions about those objects. For a study focused on short-billed (common/mew) gulls (Larus canus), data annotation techniques might involve labeling individual gulls, their poses, or their group behavior in images or video frames.
