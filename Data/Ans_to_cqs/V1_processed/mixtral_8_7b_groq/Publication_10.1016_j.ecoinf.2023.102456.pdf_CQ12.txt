Based on the provided context, the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, there are some clues that suggest the use of a neural network, possibly a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

Firstly, the authors mention the use of a backpropagation algorithm, which is a fundamental training technique for many neural networks, including RNNs. Additionally, the authors discuss the concept of learning neighborhood relationships, which implies some form of pattern recognition or sequence learning, a common application of RNNs.

Furthermore, the authors use the sigmoid activation function, which is often used in the output layer of RNNs for probability estimation. The use of a sigmoid function also ensures that the output values of the model are within the range of 0 to 1, which is consistent with the description of the model's output as a probability.

However, it is important to note that the context does not explicitly rule out the use of other deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Transformers. Therefore, while an RNN is the most likely candidate based on the available information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer without further context.
