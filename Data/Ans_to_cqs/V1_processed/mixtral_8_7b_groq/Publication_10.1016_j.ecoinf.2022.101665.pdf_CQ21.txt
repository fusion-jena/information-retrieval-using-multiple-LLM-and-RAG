Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training appear to be related to the assessment of the accuracy of a thematic map produced by a calibrated statistical prediction method. The methods proposed in the study are used when mapping probability samples that are exclusively used for map evaluation are not available.

The first step mentioned is the computation of map accuracy metrics. In the study, these metrics were computed for simulated fields after which the means were computed from the sampling distributions. However, the specific metrics used are not mentioned in the provided context.

Another postprocessing step mentioned is the use of cross-validation approaches as alternatives to the commonly used spatial cross-validation method. The proposed methods are characterized as quasi-randomization and super-population modeling approaches. These methods are used to address the spatial clustering problem and to produce less biased map accuracy estimates compared to blocked spatial cross-validation.

However, the provided context does not mention any other postprocessing steps such as the calculation of confusion matrices or the use of saliency maps. Therefore, based on the given information, it can be inferred that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are mainly focused on the assessment of map accuracy metrics using cross-validation approaches.
