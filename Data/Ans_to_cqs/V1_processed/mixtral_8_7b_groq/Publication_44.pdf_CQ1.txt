The provided context does not discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It mainly focuses on the improvements made in the DeepLabv3+ model for semantic segmentation, including the use of an Xception model as a feature extractor and the addition of an effective decoder module to improve segmentation boundaries. It also mentions connected component analysis in image processing but does not provide information on data collection methods. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to the query based on the given context.
