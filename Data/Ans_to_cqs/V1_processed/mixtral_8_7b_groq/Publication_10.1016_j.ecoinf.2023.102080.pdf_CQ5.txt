The provided context does not give information about the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline. The context is about a covariate selection procedure for species distribution models (SDMs) implemented in the covsel R package. The procedure combines a collinearity-filtering algorithm with model-specific embedded regularization techniques.

The covsel package has three functions:

1. covsel.filteralgo(): Collinearity filtering (Step A)
2. covsel.embed(): Model-specific embedding (Step B)
3. covsel.filter(): Wrapper function applying the collinearity filtering algorithm at each target level

The inputs for these functions include species presence/absence data (pa), a data frame with continuous covariate data (covdata), and optional weights and force arguments. The specific arguments for the covsel.embed() function are pa, covdata, weights (optional), and force (optional).

The context also mentions the use of a correlation coefficient threshold (corcut) for identifying collinearity and category-level and variable-level names for covariates.

However, the context does not mention any deep learning pipeline or datasets commonly used in deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
