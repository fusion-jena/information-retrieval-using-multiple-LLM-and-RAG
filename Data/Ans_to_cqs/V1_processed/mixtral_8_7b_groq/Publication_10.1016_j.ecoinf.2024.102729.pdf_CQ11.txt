Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link for it. The context consists of various research papers related to environmental pollution, water quality management, and analysis of water coverage in sub-lakes of Poyang Lake. While these papers use different datasets and methodologies, none of them mention a deep learning pipeline or share their data on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the given context.
