Based on the provided context, there is no deep learning model mentioned or described in the text. Instead, the authors use a logistic regression model and a predictor screening analysis using bootstrap forest partitioning to classify species or sex. The logistic regression model is used to assign probability values (p) to indicate the level of certainty about the classification of objects that fall within the bands of uncertainty around the discrimination hyperplane. The predictor screening analysis, on the other hand, is used to evaluate the contribution of predictors on the response object and identify variables with the greatest potential to discriminate between classes of objects.

Therefore, the purpose of the model used in the study is not for deep learning tasks such as classification, segmentation, or detection. Instead, the authors use statistical and machine learning techniques to classify species or sex based on a set of base X,Y coordinates and 124 calculated variables extracted from footprints.
