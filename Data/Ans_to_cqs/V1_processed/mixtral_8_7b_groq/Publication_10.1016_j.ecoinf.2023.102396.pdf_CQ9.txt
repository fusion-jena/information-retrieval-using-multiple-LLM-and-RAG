Based on the provided context, there is no information available about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository where it would be located. The context describes two papers authored by Guiming Wang and Xueyan Shan, published in the Ecological Informatics journal in 2024. These papers discuss the use of machine learning and state space models for the classification of animal population time series, specifically focusing on the number of harvested rabbits per hunter day in Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) in Mississippi.

The data used in the studies was obtained from the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks, which compiled and published the wildlife harvest summaries of WMAs from the 1980s to the 2000s in three reports. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository where the pipeline or the data used in the studies would be available.

Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query as the necessary information is not present in the given context.
