In the context provided, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include:

1. Normalization: The RGB channels of the images were normalized by subtracting the ImageNet mean from each channel. This step was taken to align the unsupervised classifications with the ImageNet pretraining weights.

2. Data augmentation: Data augmentation techniques of random flips and translations were tested on the images. However, it was found that these techniques had little effect on the final score.

It is important to note that the context does not mention any other preprocessing steps such as scaling or cleaning. Therefore, it can be inferred that these steps were not performed in this particular case.

Moreover, the context also mentions that pretraining data is generated by overlaying predicted trees from a LiDAR-based unsupervised algorithm on to RGB imagery. This suggests that the LiDAR-based algorithm may have performed some preprocessing on the LiDAR data before generating the predicted tree masks. However, the specifics of this preprocessing are not mentioned in the context.

In summary, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in the provided context include normalization of RGB channels and testing of data augmentation techniques. Other steps such as scaling and cleaning were not mentioned.
