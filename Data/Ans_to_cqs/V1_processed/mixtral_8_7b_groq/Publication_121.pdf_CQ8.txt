Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. It does not specify if it is hosted on GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository platform. The context focuses on the methodology, process, and results of training deep learning models for tree species identification, but it does not include information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
