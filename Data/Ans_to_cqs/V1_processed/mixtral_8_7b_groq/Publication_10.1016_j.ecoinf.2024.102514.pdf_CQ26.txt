The provided context discusses the data splitting and machine learning algorithms used in a study, but it does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the WQ indicator data was divided into training and testing datasets using a random sampling method, with 80% of the data used for training and 20% for testing.

In the context of addressing data bias, there are several techniques that can be used during the preprocessing phase of a deep learning pipeline. These techniques include:

1. Stratified sampling: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain criteria, such as class labels, and then randomly selecting samples from each subgroup to ensure that the training and testing datasets have a similar distribution of these criteria.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of samples in the minority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by randomly duplicating samples from the minority class or by generating synthetic samples using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of samples in the majority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of samples from the majority class or by using techniques such as Tomek links to remove samples that are close to the boundary between the majority and minority classes.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help to reduce bias by ensuring that the dataset includes samples from different demographic groups, geographic regions, and other relevant factors.

While the provided context does not mention any of these specific techniques, it is possible that they were used in the preprocessing phase of the deep learning pipeline. It is important to consider these techniques when working with imbalanced datasets to ensure that the model is not biased towards the majority class.
