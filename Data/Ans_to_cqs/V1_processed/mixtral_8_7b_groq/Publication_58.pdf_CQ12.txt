The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This information is provided in the context when discussing the deep learning architectures employed for the task. It is mentioned that CNNs are machine learning techniques based on sequences of layers, including convolutional and fully connected layers, which are usually followed by a non-linear activation function. However, the specific architecture of the CNN is not detailed, other than the mention of ResNet, which is a type of CNN with skip connections. Furthermore, the comparison of the performance of different models, including various deep learning techniques, indicates that a CNN-based model outperformed XGBoost for the Land Use (LU) detection task.
