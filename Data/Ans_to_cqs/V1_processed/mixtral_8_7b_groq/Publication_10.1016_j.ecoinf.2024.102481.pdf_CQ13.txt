The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the application of a machine learning technique called Random Forest (RF) for classifying the reproductive condition of fish. Therefore, I cannot provide the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model as it was not mentioned in the context. However, I can provide some information about the Random Forest model used in this study.

Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the category of ensemble learning methods. It constructs multiple decision trees during the training phase and combines their outputs to improve the final prediction. In the context, gonads of Chilean hake were randomly collected and classified as immature, mature-active, and mature-inactive. These three maturity classes were used as the target variable, and some other features were used as inputs for the RF model.

Although the context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the RF model, it does mention that machine learning algorithms, including RF, use computational methods to learn directly from data without relying on a carefully defined function as a model. These algorithms are generally predictive models and have few assumptions and little dependency on the classic statistical assumptions of conventional models.

Therefore, while the specific hyperparameters used in the RF model are not provided in the context, it is clear that the authors used this machine learning technique to classify the reproductive condition of fish accurately.
