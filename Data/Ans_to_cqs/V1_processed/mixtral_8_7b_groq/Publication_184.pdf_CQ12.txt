The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) with a feature extractor named Darknet-53. This model is chosen for its advanced accuracy and faster speed in performing floating-point operations compared to other CNNs like ResNet-152. The model is trained using bounding box data of the objects (in this case, fish) in the image dataset, and data augmentation is used to extend the amount of data. The model's performance improves swiftly in terms of precision, recall, and mean average precision before plateauing after about 1000 iterations. The number of epochs used is 200, and for each epoch, 64 images are randomly selected and used to train the model. The model took 14 hours to complete the training, and the average loss was reduced to 0.54%, indicating that the model is affected by training data.
