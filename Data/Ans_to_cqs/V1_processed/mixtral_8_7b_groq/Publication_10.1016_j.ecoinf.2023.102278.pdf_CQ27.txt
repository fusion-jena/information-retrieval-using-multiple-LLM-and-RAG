The text provided does not give a detailed description of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does provide some context about the training process and model selection that can be inferred.

Firstly, the best model was chosen based on the minimum total loss after nine epochs. This indicates that the model was trained and validated using a specific dataset, and the performance was evaluated based on the total loss. The model was chosen from a comparison with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and the Adam optimizer, where the Adam optimizer achieved a higher accuracy.

Secondly, the ResNet50 architecture was modified and trained with transfer learning using pre-trained weights from ImageNet. This suggests that the model was trained using transfer learning, where the pre-trained weights were used as a starting point for training the model on a new dataset.

Thirdly, the models trained with ResNet and EfficientNet outperformed the benchmark YOLOv5 model on the TL dataset. This indicates that the models were tested and evaluated on a specific dataset, and their performance was compared with a benchmark model.

Based on these inferences, we can assume that the following process was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model:

1. The model was trained and validated using a specific dataset.
2. The best model was chosen based on the minimum total loss after nine epochs.
3. The model was trained using transfer learning with pre-trained weights from ImageNet.
4. The model was tested and evaluated on a specific dataset and compared with a benchmark model.
5. The model was serialized and deployed on a platform for real-world use.

While the text does not explicitly mention model serialization or platform selection, it can be assumed that these steps were taken as part of the deployment process. Model serialization involves saving the trained model in a format that can be loaded and used for inference. Platform selection involves choosing a platform or environment where the model can be deployed and used for real-world applications.

Therefore, while the text does not provide a detailed description of the deployment process, it can be inferred that the trained deep learning model was serialized and deployed on a platform for real-world use.
