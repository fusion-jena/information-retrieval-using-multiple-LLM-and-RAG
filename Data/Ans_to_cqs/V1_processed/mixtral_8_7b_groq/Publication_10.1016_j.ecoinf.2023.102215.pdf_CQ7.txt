The provided context does not give specific criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets for deep learning model training. However, it does provide information about the training process and evaluation of a deep learning model called TrunkNet.

In the context, the model training is supervised with the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted probability and the actual value. The model's performance is evaluated based on total training time, average inference time, model parameters, and FLOPs (Floating Point Operations Per Second) compared to other 10 SOTAs (State-Of-The-Art).

In general, data splitting for deep learning model training involves dividing the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

The criteria for splitting the data can vary depending on the problem, dataset size, and the deep learning model used. However, a common practice is to split the data into 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. Another approach is to use k-fold cross-validation, where the data is divided into k subsets, and the model is trained and validated k times, each time using a different subset for validation and the remaining k-1 subsets for training.

In summary, the provided context does not give specific criteria for splitting data for deep learning model training. However, it is essential to split the data into training, validation, and testing sets to train, tune, and evaluate the model's performance. The criteria for splitting the data can vary depending on the problem, dataset size, and the deep learning model used.
