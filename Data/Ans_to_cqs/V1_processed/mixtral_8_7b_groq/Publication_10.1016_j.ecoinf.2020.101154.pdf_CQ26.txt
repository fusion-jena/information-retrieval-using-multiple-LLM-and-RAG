The provided context discusses the data preprocessing and model training techniques used for machine learning, specifically for Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT), but it does not explicitly mention the use of stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing.

However, it does mention a specific data splitting approach called RY data splitting, which involves grouping observations according to a certain feature (in this case, year of capture) and then randomly selecting years for inclusion in the train and test datasets. While this approach does not ensure completely unbiased test and train datasets, it does help in testing the model using previously unseen combinations of explanatory variables, making it a more robust test of model performance.

In addition, the context discusses hyperparameter tuning techniques such as manual tuning, grid search, and early stopping to prevent overfitting and improve model performance. These techniques are used to find the best set of hyperparameters for the model, which can help in improving the model's ability to generalize to new data.

It is important to note that data bias can arise from various sources, such as unrepresentative data, measurement errors, and missing values. To address these issues, it is essential to employ appropriate preprocessing techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified sampling involves dividing the data into strata based on certain features and then randomly selecting samples from each stratum to ensure that the train and test datasets are representative of the overall population. Oversampling and undersampling involve adjusting the class frequencies in the data to address issues of imbalanced classes. Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population in terms of demographics, geographical distribution, and other relevant factors.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of these techniques, it is important to consider them as part of a comprehensive approach to addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
