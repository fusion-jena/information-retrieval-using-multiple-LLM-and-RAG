The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for plant leaf recognition and disease detection. However, it can be inferred that various approaches such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets might have been used based on related works in this field.

For instance, in the study by Begue et al. (2017), machine learning techniques were applied for automatic recognition of medicinal plants, implying the use of a labeled dataset, which could have been obtained through surveys or existing databases. Similarly, Pushpa and Rani (2023) developed Ayur-PlantNet, a deep convolutional neural network for Indian Ayurvedic plant species classification, suggesting the availability of a dataset for these specific plant species.

In addition, recent studies have utilized high-resolution images for leaf-based plant species classification (Quach et al., 2023) and disease detection in single crop species (Chulif et al., 2023). These images could have been collected using sensors or cameras specifically designed for plant image acquisition. Moreover, public datasets might also be used, as seen in the work by Ganguly et al. (2022), where ResNet-50 architecture was employed on three benchmark datasets for leaf feature pattern capture.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for plant leaf recognition and disease detection, it can be inferred that surveys, sensors, and public datasets are likely sources of raw data in this domain.
