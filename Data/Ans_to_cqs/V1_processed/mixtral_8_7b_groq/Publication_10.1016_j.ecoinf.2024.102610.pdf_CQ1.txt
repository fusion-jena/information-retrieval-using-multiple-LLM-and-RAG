The provided context does not give a specific answer to the query regarding the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some sources of data that could be used in such a pipeline.

The Keshavamurthy et al. (2022) systematic review of machine learning and deep learning approaches for predicting infectious diseases mentions the use of public datasets for training models. However, it does not provide details on how these datasets were originally collected.

The Khun (2022) paper on the "caret" package in R, which can be used for machine learning, does not discuss data collection methods.

The Laaksonen et al. (2017) paper on crowdsourcing-based tick collection in Finland describes a method for collecting data on ticks and the diseases they carry. While this is not a deep learning pipeline, it does demonstrate the use of crowdsourcing as a method for collecting data.

The context also mentions several sources of data that could potentially be used as inputs in a deep learning pipeline, including tsetse density data, TerraClimate data, Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data. However, the context does not provide information on how these datasets were originally collected.

In summary, while the provided context does not give a specific answer to the query, it does suggest that public datasets, crowdsourcing, and remote sensing data could be used as sources of raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, the methods used to collect these data are not discussed in the provided context.
