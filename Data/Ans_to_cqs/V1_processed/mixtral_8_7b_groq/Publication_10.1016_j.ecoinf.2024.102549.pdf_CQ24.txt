While the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of a specific seed value in one instance. In the study by Chen et al. (2020), they applied a deep learning CNN architecture for smart near-infrared analysis of water pollution. They utilized the k-means clustering method for feature extraction and set a random seed value to ensure the reproducibility of their results. This suggests that setting a random seed value is one way to manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, deep learning models often contain stochastic components, such as random initialization of weights and biases, dropout regularization, and data shuffling during training. These sources of randomness can affect the model's training process and final performance. To handle randomness, deep learning practitioners can employ several strategies:

1. Fixed random seed value: By setting a fixed random seed value, researchers can ensure the reproducibility of their experiments. This is particularly important for comparing different models or hyperparameter settings.
2. Model ensemble: Combining multiple models trained with different random seeds can improve the robustness and generalization of the final model. Ensemble methods, such as bagging and boosting, can reduce the variance associated with individual models.
3. Cross-validation: To account for randomness in data shuffling and model initialization, cross-validation techniques can be used. This involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on different subsets, and averaging the performance metrics.
4. Regularization techniques: Strategies like L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping can help reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance. These techniques can help manage the randomness introduced during weight initialization and data shuffling.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of a fixed random seed value for reproducibility. In general, deep learning practitioners can employ various strategies to manage randomness, including setting a fixed random seed value, model ensemble, cross-validation, and regularization techniques.
