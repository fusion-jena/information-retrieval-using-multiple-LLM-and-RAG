Based on the provided context, there is no information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study "Improving deep learning based bluespotted ribbontail ray (Taeniura Lymma) recognition" published in the Ecological Informatics journal. The article provides details about the methodology, including the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and transfer learning, but it does not mention the code repository or its location.

However, the article does mention the use of the imgaug library for image augmentation, which is available on GitHub at <https://imgaug.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>. It is possible that the code for the deep learning pipeline is also available on GitHub or another code repository, but it is not mentioned in the article.

Additionally, the article mentions the use of a feature-extraction enhancement instead of data augmentation, which could suggest that the code for this enhancement may be included in the deep learning pipeline. However, without more information, it is not possible to determine the location of the code repository.

In conclusion, while the article mentions the use of the imgaug library, there is no information provided about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study.
