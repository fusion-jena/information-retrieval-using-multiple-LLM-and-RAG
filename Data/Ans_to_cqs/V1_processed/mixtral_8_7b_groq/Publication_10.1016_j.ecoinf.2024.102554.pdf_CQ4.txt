Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context focuses on the description of a crawling tool used to gather historical and near real-time data from different Sentinel-3 Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) products. It explains that the data, sourced from ESA or NASA, is stored in NetCDF files and includes essential parameters like reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT), and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations. The tool is designed to work with Sentinel-3-related products, which offer daily data from the same world region around the same hour, increasing the data acquisition window from a mere one-fifth to a commendable 70% coverage.

However, the text does not mention any data augmentation techniques. Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the amount and diversity of training data, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize. Since the context does not provide information on these techniques, it is not possible to give a precise answer to this query.
