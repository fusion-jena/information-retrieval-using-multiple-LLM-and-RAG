Based on the provided context, the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. The text focuses on the training and testing of various algorithms, including a convolutional neural network (AlexNet), but it does not detail the data annotation methods utilized.

However, it can be inferred that some form of image annotation was performed, as the algorithms were used to identify specific categories of bugs (Rhodnius, Panstrongylus, and Triatoma) from a picture database. Image annotation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Image-level annotation: In this method, each image is labeled with a single class or category, indicating the primary object or concept present in the image.
2. Bounding box annotation: Here, bounding boxes are drawn around objects of interest within an image, allowing the algorithm to focus on specific regions.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves dividing an image into multiple segments or regions, each representing a distinct class or object.
4. Instance segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, instance segmentation further differentiates individual instances of objects within the same class.

Given the complexity of the task, it is likely that at least bounding box annotation or instance segmentation was employed. However, without more specific information from the context, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.
