The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The articles discuss the development and implementation of the 3DUNetGSFormer model for wetland mapping, but there is no mention of where the code for this model can be found. It is possible that the authors have not yet made the code publicly available, or it may be hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. If you are interested in accessing the code, I would recommend reaching out to the authors directly to inquire about its availability.
