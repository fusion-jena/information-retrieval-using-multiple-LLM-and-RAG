The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study to develop BivalveNet. The reference for the study, "BivalveNet: A hybrid deep neural network for common cockle (Cerastoderma edule) geographical traceability based on shell image analysis," does not mention any data repository in the Algorithm section or anywhere else in the text. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the data repository is available based on the given context.
