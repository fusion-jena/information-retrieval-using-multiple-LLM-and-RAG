Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. The text mentions the performance of machine learning models such as Random Forest (RF) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) in predicting groundwater (GW) salinity hazard maps. However, it does not specify the methods used for hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search, random search, or other optimization techniques.

Hyperparameter tuning is an essential step in the machine learning process to ensure the model's generalization and prevent overfitting. Common methods for hyperparameter tuning include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and gradient-based optimization. Grid search involves testing all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a specified range, while random search selects a subset of combinations randomly. Bayesian optimization uses probabilistic models to find the optimal set of hyperparameters, and gradient-based optimization uses gradient descent algorithms to minimize the loss function.

Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query. It is recommended to refer to the original source or consult the authors for more details on the hyperparameter tuning methods used in the study.
