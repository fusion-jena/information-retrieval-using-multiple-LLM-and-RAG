The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning frameworks were used in the studies. However, it is mentioned that machine learning and deep learning methodologies were employed in animal behavior studies (MSC 2020), with applications including computational modeling and solution development for animal decision-making in T-mazes (Keywords).

Deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch are popular tools for constructing and training deep learning models. TensorFlow, developed by Google Brain, is a powerful library for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning. PyTorch, created by Facebook's AI Research lab, is a flexible deep learning framework that offers seamless transition between CPUs and GPUs.

Considering the publication years of the sources (Yang and Mailman 2018; Zhang et al. 2015; Yerkes 1912; EcologicalInformatics81(2024)10263916; EcologicalInformatics81(2024)1026395; MSC 2020), it is plausible that either TensorFlow or PyTorch, or both, were used in the studies, as they are widely adopted in recent research. Nonetheless, without explicit information in the context, it is not possible to definitively state which deep learning frameworks were utilized.
