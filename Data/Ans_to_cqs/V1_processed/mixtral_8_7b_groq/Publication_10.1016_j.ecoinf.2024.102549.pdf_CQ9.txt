Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses a study that uses a deep learning method for cyanobacterial harmful algae blooms prediction in Taihu Lake, China, and another study analyzing the spatio-temporal distribution of colored dissolved organic matter over Ebinur Lake in Xinjiang, China. However, it does not mention where the data used in these studies can be found.

The studies reference various papers and sources but none of them point to a data repository. For instance, the studies cite works by Cao et al. (2022) and Cao et al. (2023), but these are research papers, not data repositories. Similarly, the context mentions the use of the AlexNet architecture in a study related to Lake Dianchi, but it does not provide a link to the data used in that study.

In conclusion, the provided context does not contain information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. If you are interested in accessing the data used in the studies mentioned, I would recommend reaching out to the authors directly or checking the list of references in the papers for potential leads.
