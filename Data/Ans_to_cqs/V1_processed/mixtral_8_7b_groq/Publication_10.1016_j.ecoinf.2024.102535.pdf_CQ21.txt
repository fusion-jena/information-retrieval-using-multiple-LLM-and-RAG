Based on the provided context, there are no specific mentions of post-training saliency maps or other visualization techniques being applied. However, there are details about the calculation of performance metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix.

After training the models with different architectures (VGG, ResNet18 V1, ResNet50 V1, ResNet18 V2, ResNet50 V2, and Xception) on various substratum characterizations (Lithology, Morphology), the following postprocessing steps were taken:

1. Metrics calculation: The models' performance was evaluated using several metrics, such as accuracy. The testing results were averaged over three executions, each with a different random initialization of trainable parameters and a different data fold. The provided table shows the accuracy of each model trained on different substratum characterizations.

2. Confusion matrix: Although not explicitly mentioned, it is common practice to calculate a confusion matrix to better understand the models' performance. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predictions made by a classification model. It is called a confusion matrix because it can show if the system is confusing two classes. The number of correct and incorrect predictions are summarized with count values and broken down by each class.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after model training include calculating performance metrics, such as accuracy, and generating a confusion matrix to assess the models' performance. However, there is no information in the provided context about the use of saliency maps or other visualization techniques.
