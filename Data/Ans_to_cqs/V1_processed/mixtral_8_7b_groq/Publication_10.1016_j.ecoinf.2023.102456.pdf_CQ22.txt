The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrices, false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) percentage, balanced accuracy (B. Acc), F-measure Fβ, Cohen’s kappa coefficient k, and Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC).

Accuracy is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of a model. However, in the context of the assessment of the deep learning model, accuracy is used in conjunction with other metrics such as F1-score, confusion matrices, FP and FN percentage, B. Acc, F-measure Fβ, Cohen’s kappa coefficient k, and MCC.

Confusion matrices provide detailed information regarding both correct and incorrect classifications made by the model. This valuable insight enables the identification of potential deficiencies in classifying specific classes or categories.

The FP and FN percentage measures the percentage of hits that the model achieves for each class. These metrics are useful in determining how well the model fits the data.

Additional metrics such as B. Acc, F-measure Fβ, Cohen’s kappa coefficient k, and MCC provide a more complete and accurate picture of the performance of the model. These metrics have proven to be adequate in similar contexts, although they have their own limitations.

The deep learning model uses a new data-driven architecture that aims to learn the neighborhood relationship Rk to improve the results of the model. The learning of the neighborhood relationship also allows for the understanding of how the different elements of the system interact.

In conclusion, the deep learning model’s performance is evaluated using a comprehensive set of metrics, including accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrices, FP and FN percentage, B. Acc, F-measure Fβ, Cohen’s kappa coefficient k, and MCC. These metrics provide a detailed and accurate assessment of the model’s performance, enabling the identification of potential areas for improvement.
