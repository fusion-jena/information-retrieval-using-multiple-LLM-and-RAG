The provided context does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning frameworks were used to build the model. The CRediT authorship contribution statement lists various contributions made by the authors, such as methodology, visualization, and software, but it does not specify the use of any particular framework. Similarly, the declaration of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process only mentions the use of Bingchat for translation, not for building the deep learning model. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine which frameworks were used to build the deep learning model.
