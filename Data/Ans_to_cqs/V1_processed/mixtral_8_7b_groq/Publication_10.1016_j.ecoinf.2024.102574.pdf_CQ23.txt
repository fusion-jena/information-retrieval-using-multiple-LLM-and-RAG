The provided context does not contain specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does mention several studies that have used deep learning techniques in the context of geosciences and remote sensing.

In the study by Marrs and Ni-Meister (2019), they used machine learning techniques for tree species classification using co-registered LiDAR and hyperspectral data. While they do not explicitly mention the use of techniques such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, they do emphasize the importance of using co-registered data from multiple sources to improve the accuracy of their classification model.

Liu et al. (2022) used a neural network guided interpolation for mapping canopy height of China's forests by integrating GEDI and ICESat-2 data. They mention that they used a "leave-one-out" cross-validation strategy to evaluate the performance of their model. This is a type of cross-validation where one observation is left out of the training set and used for testing, and this process is repeated for each observation in the dataset. This approach can help to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and can generalize well to new data.

In the study by Qin et al. (2022), they performed individual tree segmentation and tree species classification in subtropical broadleaf forests using UAV-based LiDAR, hyperspectral, and ultrahigh-resolution RGB data. While they do not explicitly mention the use of diverse dataset or stratified splitting, they do mention that they used a random forest classifier, which is a type of ensemble learning algorithm that can help to reduce overfitting and improve the generalizability of the model.

Overall, while the provided context does not contain explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, it does suggest that researchers in this field are aware of the importance of techniques such as cross-validation, ensemble learning, and the use of diverse and co-registered data sources.
