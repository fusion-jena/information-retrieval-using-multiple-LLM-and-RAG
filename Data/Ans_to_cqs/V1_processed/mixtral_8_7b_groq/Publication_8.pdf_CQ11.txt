Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text mentions the researchers and their affiliations, the methods used for detecting and annotating plant organs from digitized herbarium scans, and the publication details, but it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
