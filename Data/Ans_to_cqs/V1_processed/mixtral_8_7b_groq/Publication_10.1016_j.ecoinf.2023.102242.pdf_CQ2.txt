The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study involves the processing of high-resolution remote sensing data, which often comes in the form of imagery.

Remote sensing data is typically collected through various methods such as satellite or aerial imaging, and it can include different types of data such as multispectral, hyperspectral, or radar data. These data formats are often in the form of raster images, where each pixel value represents a specific measurement or feature.

In the context provided, it is mentioned that the processing of high-resolution remote sensing data involves feature information, which suggests that the data is being analyzed for specific features or characteristics. This is often done through the process of feature extraction, where relevant features are extracted from the raw data to be used as input for the deep learning model.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the data formats used in this particular deep learning pipeline are likely to be raster image formats associated with remote sensing data. However, it is important to note that the specific data format used may vary depending on the nature of the study and the data available. Other data formats such as CSV or audio/video files may also be used in other deep learning pipelines, depending on the specific application and the data being analyzed.
