The provided context does not include information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It gives details about the parameter values, optimizer, and scheduler used in the training of an Autoencoder model and an MLP. However, it does not mention any code repository or version control platform where the implementation of this pipeline can be found, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide the code repository link based on the given context.
