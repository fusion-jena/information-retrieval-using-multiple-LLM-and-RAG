The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, specifically for the EfficientNet model mentioned in the context, involve dividing the prepared dataset into training and validation sets. In this case, 80% of the 4000 images for each category were used for training, while the remaining 20% were used for validation.

The dataset consisted of images prepared using data augmentation methods. For each category, 4000 images were used, resulting in a substantial dataset for training and validation. The EfficientNet model was then trained using the Adagrad optimizer over 100 epochs. A dropout rate of 0.5 was set for each task, and the batch size was set at 20.

It is important to note that the data splitting criteria mentioned here are specific to the EfficientNet model's training process. Different models or projects might require different data splitting ratios or methods, depending on the size and nature of the dataset.

In addition, the context also mentions the use of Intersection over Union (IoU) as a threshold for evaluating the model's performance. However, IoU is not directly involved in the data splitting criteria for training, validation, and testing. Instead, it is used to determine the correctness of the detected objects based on the confidence scores estimated by the object detector. In this case, an IoU threshold of 0.3 was set to consider correct or incorrect detection results.

Another interesting aspect of the context is the use of the YOLOv4 model for re-identifying candidate regions. However, this process occurs after the initial training and validation of the EfficientNet model and does not influence the data splitting criteria for the EfficientNet's training process.

In summary, the criteria used to split the data for the deep learning model training (EfficientNet) involve dividing the prepared dataset into training and validation sets, with 80% and 20% of the images used for each purpose, respectively.
