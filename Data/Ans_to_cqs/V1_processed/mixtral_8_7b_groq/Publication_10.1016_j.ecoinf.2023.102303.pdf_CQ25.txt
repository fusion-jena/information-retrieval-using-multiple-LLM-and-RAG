The deep learning models discussed in the provided context are used for object detection, specifically for fish detection in underwater and coastal environments. This is evident in section 2 of the paper, where the authors describe their weakly labeled public FishInTurbidWater dataset and propose two deep neural network (DNN) models for fish detection in turbid waters.

The first model, EfficientNet-B7, is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that is used for object detection. CNNs are commonly used for image classification, segmentation, and object detection tasks. In this case, EfficientNet-B7 is being used for object detection, as it is a part of the proposed solution for fish detection in turbid waters.

The second model proposed in the paper is not explicitly named or described in terms of its architecture. However, it is mentioned that this model is a weakly-supervised model that is designed to shorten deployment time while providing high accuracy. Weakly-supervised models are a type of deep learning model that can learn from a small amount of labeled data, and they are often used for object detection tasks.

Overall, the purpose of the deep learning models discussed in the provided context is to enhance the capability of marine scientists in turbid underwater and coastal environment monitoring by enabling accurate and efficient fish detection in turbid waters.
