I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context mainly focuses on the use of partial least-squares regression (PLSR) for estimating total nitrogen (TN) in soil samples, comparing different pre-processing methods and wavelength ranges. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to your query.
