The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline, as described in the given context, is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This model is specifically referred to as AlexNet, which is a CNN architecture proposed by Krizhevsky et al. in 2012. The model was applied successfully in image scene classification tasks and has been used in the study to classify water quality levels based on the input images.

The CNN model is chosen for its practical strategies, such as ReLU nonlinear layers and dropout regularization techniques, which make it effective for small-sized inputs, easy to train and optimize, and potent for handling complex problems. Compared to other CNN models like VGG and ResNet, AlexNet has a simpler structure and is effective for small-sized inputs, which are easy to train and optimize, and have more computational power to handle complex problems.

The CNN model is used in a pipeline that includes several steps, such as extracting or detecting input image features using the convolutional layer, reducing the dimension of the feature map using the pooling layer, and classifying input images into labels using the fully connected layers. The model is trained using the three categories of water quality level as training sets.

In summary, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) of the AlexNet architecture.
