The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves tuning the number of required epochs and inspecting the model outputs and error outcomes for signs of overfitting. In the context provided, the authors trained and tested their models for image classification in the field of ecological informatics. They assessed the effectiveness of their techniques by computing the top-k accuracy on a test set, where k = 1, 5, and 10 represents the position of the correct match within a list of proposed matches.

To prevent overfitting, the authors monitored the model's performance during training by observing whether the model was focusing excessively on data fitting, potentially imitating insignificant noise instead of capturing the broad properties of interest. In machine learning terms, this behavior is referred to as overfitting, which occurs when the algorithm's long-term behavior resembles memorizing its training set rather than learning a generalized matching strategy.

In this specific study, the authors mentioned that their detection algorithm converged to its most accurate state after assessing each image only 10â€“30 times, which is fewer training epochs than the typical duration of between 70 and 250 epochs. They further stated that subsequent training had no effect or even decreased the algorithm's performance on held-out test data, indicating overfitting. By monitoring the model's performance in this manner, the authors ensured that their image classification models maintained their predictive capabilities and generalized well to unseen data.
