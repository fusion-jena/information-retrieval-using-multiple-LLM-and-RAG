In the context of deep learning, regularization methods are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function, which helps to reduce the complexity of the model and improve its generalization ability. Two commonly used regularization techniques are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization method that is used during training to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out a fraction of the neurons in a layer. This helps to break the co-adaptation of neurons, which can lead to overfitting. In the CNN architecture provided in the context, dropout is applied after the third max pooling layer with a dropout rate of 0.4.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a method that adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This helps to shrink the weights towards zero, which can improve the generalization ability of the model. However, the provided context does not mention the use of L2 regularization in the CNN architecture.

It is worth noting that the CNN architecture provided in the context is not one of the pre-trained models approaches mentioned in the transfer learning section, such as VGG16, ResNet-50, Xception, or DenseNet121. The CNN architecture has a different number of layers and a different output shape compared to these pre-trained models.

In summary, the regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting include dropout and L2 regularization. The CNN architecture provided in the context uses dropout, but it does not use L2 regularization.
