The context does not provide specific details about how the raw data was collected for the deep learning pipeline in this study. However, it does mention that the dataset used in this work can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which suggests that the data was obtained from a public dataset.

Additionally, the context states that the dataset consists of images of plant species leaves that appear in controlled backlit and front-lit versions, with several samples per species. These images vary in sharpness, noise, illumination patterns, and shadows. This information implies that the data was collected through image capturing, but it does not specify the exact method used for collecting the images.

In general, raw data for deep learning pipelines can be collected through various methods, including but not limited to:

1. Surveys: Surveys can be used to collect data from a large number of participants or observations. For example, a survey could be used to collect data on people's opinions or behaviors.
2. Sensors: Sensors can be used to collect data from the environment or from physical objects. For example, sensors could be used to collect data on temperature, humidity, or motion.
3. Public datasets: Public datasets are often available for research purposes and can be a valuable resource for deep learning pipelines. These datasets can include a wide variety of data types, such as images, text, or audio.
4. Private datasets: Private datasets are owned by individuals or organizations and may require permission to access. These datasets can be useful for deep learning pipelines that require specific or proprietary data.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific information on how the raw data was collected in this study, it is likely that the data was obtained from a public dataset or through image capturing.
