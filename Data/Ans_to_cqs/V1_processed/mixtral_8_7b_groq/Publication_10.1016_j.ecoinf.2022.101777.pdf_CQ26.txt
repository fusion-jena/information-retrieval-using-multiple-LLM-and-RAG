The provided context does not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss some preprocessing techniques related to image data and water flow data.

In the context of image data, it is mentioned that the 20 m bands of imagery were resampled to 10 m to harmonize all band data and ensure that the classification of images was adjusted to this resolution. This is an example of data preprocessing, but it does not specifically address data bias.

In the context of water flow data, there is no mention of any preprocessing techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query. However, some common techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain criteria (such as class labels) and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to create the training, validation, and test sets. This helps ensure that each set has a representative distribution of the classes in the dataset.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of samples in the minority class(es) to balance the dataset. This can be done by duplicating existing samples or by generating new synthetic samples using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of samples in the majority class(es) to balance the dataset. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of the majority class samples or by using more sophisticated techniques such as Tomek links.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population being modeled. This can help reduce bias by ensuring that the dataset includes a diverse range of characteristics and scenarios.


 The provided context does not mention any of the above techniques being used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
