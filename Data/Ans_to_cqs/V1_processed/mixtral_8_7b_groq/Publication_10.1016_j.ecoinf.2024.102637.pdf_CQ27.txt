The text provided does not give specific details about the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the AlexNet network was optimized to be lightweight and efficient, with two convolution layers merged in the model deployment mode. This suggests that some steps were taken to prepare the model for deployment, such as model serialization, which is the process of converting the trained model into a format that can be stored and loaded again.

Additionally, the authors' focus on reducing computational complexity and deployment costs implies that they considered platform selection, which involves choosing the hardware and software environment where the model will be deployed. This could include optimizing the model to run on specific devices, such as mobile phones or embedded systems, or using cloud-based platforms for deployment.

In summary, while the text does not provide specific details about the process of deploying the trained deep learning model, it does suggest that some steps were taken to optimize the model for deployment, such as model serialization and platform selection.
