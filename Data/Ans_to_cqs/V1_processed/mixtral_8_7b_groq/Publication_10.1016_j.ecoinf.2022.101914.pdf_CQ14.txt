The provided context does not give specific details about how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized, such as whether a grid search, random search, or some other method was used. However, it does mention that for the optimized ensemble model, they included the best performing models based on AUC, which suggests that some form of hyperparameter tuning was done to select the best models. Additionally, the text mentions that they performed scale optimization for environmental covariates, which involved calculating focal statistics for each covariate using a moving window of different radii and comparing scales using t-tests. This implies that some form of hyperparameter optimization was done for the environmental covariates. However, the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization is not specified in the given context.
