Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the deep learning framework used for building the model. The context only describes the development of a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network with a specific architecture and activation functions.

However, it is important to note that the choice of deep learning framework often depends on the specific requirements of the project, the expertise of the development team, and the available resources. Common deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Theano.

Given that the paper was published in the journal Ecological Informatics, it is possible that the authors used a popular framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, which are widely used in the field of ecological informatics and environmental modeling.

In summary, while the specific deep learning framework used in the study is not mentioned in the provided context, it is possible that the authors used a popular framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
