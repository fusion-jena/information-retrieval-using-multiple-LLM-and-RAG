The provided context does not directly discuss the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some information on these regularization techniques that are commonly used in deep learning.


Regularization methods are essential in deep learning to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Two common regularization techniques used in deep learning are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of neurons in a layer to zero during training, preventing over-reliance on any single neuron and promoting the development of redundant representations across the network. This helps improve the model's generalization performance.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function, proportional to the sum of squares of the model's weights. This encourages smaller weight values, reducing the capacity of the model and making it less prone to overfitting.

These techniques can be applied together or separately, depending on the specific deep learning pipeline and the complexity of the data. Implementing regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization can help ensure that deep learning models perform well on new, unseen data.
