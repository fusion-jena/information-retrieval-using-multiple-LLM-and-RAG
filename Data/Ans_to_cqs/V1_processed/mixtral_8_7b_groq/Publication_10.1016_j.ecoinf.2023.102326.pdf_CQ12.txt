The provided context does not give information about the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers in the described pipeline. The pipeline primarily focuses on the application of Complex Networks for analyzing the Urban Acoustic Environment (AE). It involves the creation of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) from power spectra, thresholding, and the construction of adjacency matrices and network representations. The analysis is performed using Python 3.8.5 and specific packages. However, the context does not mention the use of any deep learning models.
