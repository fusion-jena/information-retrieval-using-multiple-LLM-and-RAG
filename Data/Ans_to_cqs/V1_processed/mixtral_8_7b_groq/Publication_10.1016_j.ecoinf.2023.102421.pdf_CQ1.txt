The raw data in the deep learning pipeline for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) is collected using a combination of field surveys and remote sensing images. Firstly, sample plots are collected in a province in the northern part of Vietnam, where changes in land cover have been considered crucial. These sample plots undergo image processing to generate a tabulated dataset, which includes on-field AGB and independent features. The independent features are derived from Sentinel 1A and Landsat images, as well as ground survey data. The combination of these data sources provides a comprehensive dataset for training machine learning models. It is worth noting that the study focuses on LightGBM and XGBoost models, and the data collection methodology is tailored to these models' requirements.
