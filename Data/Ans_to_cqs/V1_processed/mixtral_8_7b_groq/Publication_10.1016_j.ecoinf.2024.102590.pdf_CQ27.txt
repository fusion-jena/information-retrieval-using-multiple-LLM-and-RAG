The provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that Google Earth Engine (GEE) played a significant role in the analysis of large-area, high spatial resolution aerial images. GEE allowed different operators to collect training and test samples using a cloud-based server to run the analyses, minimizing large data management and storage. This suggests that the deep learning model might have been deployed on the GEE platform, but the exact process of model serialization and deployment is not provided.
