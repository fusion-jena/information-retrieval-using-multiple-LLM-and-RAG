The provided context discusses the challenges of using machine learning algorithms for ecology and conservation applications, specifically focusing on the issue of impure or not fully representative training data. It also introduces MTMI-SMF, a machine learning algorithm designed to handle such imperfect data. However, the context does not directly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique that ensures each subset (e.g., training, validation, or testing) has a similar distribution of classes as the original dataset. Oversampling and undersampling are techniques that balance class representation in the training dataset by either duplicating minority class instances (oversampling) or removing majority class instances (undersampling). Diverse data collection involves gathering data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of all possible scenarios, reducing the likelihood of bias.

Based on the given context, we can infer that MTMI-SMF addresses data bias by grouping pixels surrounding a training location that could potentially contain the invader. This approach allows for more flexibility in handling impure data and reduces the need for an educated guess on which pixel best represents the training location. However, the context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing techniques mentioned in the query.
