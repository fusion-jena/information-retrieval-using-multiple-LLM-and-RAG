Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The sources cited in the text do not mention the data repository being hosted on any specific platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.

However, some of the papers and resources mentioned do provide links to their data or code. For instance, the paper "Sashimi: A toolkit for facilitating high-throughput organismal image segmentation using deep learning" by Schwartz and Alfaro (2021) has a corresponding data repository on the University of California's institutional repository, eScholarship, which can be accessed at: <https://escholarship.org/uc/item/8qb6s7r0>.

Another paper, "patternize: An R package for quantifying colour pattern variation" by Van Belleghem et al. (2018), provides a link to their GitHub repository where the code and data are available: <https://github.com/smvb/patternize>.

Lastly, the iNaturalist Species Classification and Detection dataset by Van Horn et al. (2018) is available on the IEEE conference website: <https://www.cvpr2018.thecvf.com/papers/VanHorn_The_iNaturalist_Species_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf>.

Therefore, while there is no explicit information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline, some related resources do provide links to their data or code.
