The text does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does describe some techniques used to manage other sources of variability and uncertainty in the deep learning process for predicting the conservation status of orchid species.

To account for variability in the training data, the authors used cross-validation, where they randomly split the data into training and validation sets and shifted the validation set five times. This allowed them to quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy across different models with different numbers of hidden layers and subsets of features.

To handle uncertainty in the model's predictions, the authors used Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) as a potential strategy. BNNs allow for the estimation of uncertainty in the model's outputs by modeling the weights of the network as probability distributions rather than fixed values. However, the text notes that the choice of prior distribution in BNNs can affect the ability to identify unknowns.

The authors also acknowledge the potential impact of sampling bias on the model's performance. Sampling bias occurs when some observations are more likely to be included in the data set than others, leading to a non-random sample. The text mentions the importance of collecting occurrence records for orchid species, particularly those that are threatened or of conservation concern.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does describe techniques for managing variability in the training data, uncertainty in the model's predictions, and potential sources of bias in the data. These strategies can help ensure the robustness and reliability of the model's predictions for the conservation status of orchid species.
