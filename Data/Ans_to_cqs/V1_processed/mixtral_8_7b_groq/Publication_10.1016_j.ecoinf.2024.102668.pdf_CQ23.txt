Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a specific deep learning model. However, the study does discuss steps taken to enhance the applicability and comparability of ecoacoustic indices (EAI) for potential use in machine learning and deep learning.

One of the sources of variability that could affect the comparability of EAIs is the differences between recording devices. The study used two brands of recording devices: SongMeter and AudioMoth, with different sampling frequencies (FS) and gain settings. To address this issue, the study used a comprehensive processing pipeline to mitigate device biases in site comparisons using EAIs. This methodology could potentially contribute to the generalizability of a deep learning model by reducing the impact of device-related variability.

Additionally, the study used two different sample schemes for the recordings: inter-brand and intra-brand. The inter-brand scheme involved using two recording devices from different brands, with 1988 recordings and a sample duration of 1 × 15 minutes. The intra-brand scheme involved using 15 recording devices from the same brand, with 203 recordings and a sample duration of 1 × 5 minutes. This approach allowed for a more diverse dataset, which could help improve the generalizability of a deep learning model.

However, the provided context does not mention other common techniques for improving the generalizability of deep learning models, such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or data augmentation. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on one subset and testing it on another, and repeating this process for all subsets. Stratified splitting ensures that each subset contains a representative proportion of the different classes in the dataset. Data augmentation involves creating new synthetic samples by applying transformations to the existing data, which can help improve the model's performance on unseen data.

Therefore, while the study does take some steps to enhance the applicability and comparability of EAIs for potential use in machine learning and deep learning, it does not provide explicit information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a specific deep learning model.
