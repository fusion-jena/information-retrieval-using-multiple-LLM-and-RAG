Based on the provided context, there is no specific strategy mentioned for monitoring the model performance during training. The text focuses on the comparison of deep learning approaches with traditional machine learning methods for image retrieval tasks. It provides detailed information about the datasets used, the evaluation metrics, and the performance of various networks, but it does not discuss training monitoring strategies.

However, it is important to note that monitoring the model performance during training is a standard practice in machine learning projects. This can be done using various techniques such as plotting training and validation loss, accuracy, or other relevant metrics over epochs. This helps to identify if the model is overfitting or underfitting, and whether the training process is stable or not. It also allows for early stopping, which can prevent the model from training for too long and overfitting to the training data.

In the context of the provided text, it is likely that the authors used some form of monitoring strategy during training, but it was not included in the text. It is best practice to include such information in research papers to ensure reproducibility and to provide a complete picture of the experimental setup.
