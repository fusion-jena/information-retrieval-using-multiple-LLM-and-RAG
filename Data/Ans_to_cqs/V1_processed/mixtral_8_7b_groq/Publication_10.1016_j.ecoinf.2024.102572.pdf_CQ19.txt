Based on the provided context, the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that machine learning techniques were used to classify fire-damaged monuments and to quantify carbon emissions from forest fires with intricate influencing factors.

Two machine learning techniques are mentioned: the Direct Application Programming Interface (API) in Python, which is used to retrieve picture data for forest fire point information, and a cloud platform that incorporates high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite images. While these techniques are not deep learning frameworks themselves, they can be used in conjunction with deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

TensorFlow and PyTorch are two of the most popular open-source deep learning frameworks used for research and production. TensorFlow is developed by Google Brain and is widely used for its robustness, scalability, and flexibility. PyTorch, on the other hand, is developed by Facebook's AI Research lab and is known for its simplicity and ease of use.

Given that the study was conducted by a research center and the context mentions machine learning techniques, it is highly likely that one of these deep learning frameworks was used. However, without explicit mention in the provided context, it is not possible to definitively answer which deep learning frameworks were used.
