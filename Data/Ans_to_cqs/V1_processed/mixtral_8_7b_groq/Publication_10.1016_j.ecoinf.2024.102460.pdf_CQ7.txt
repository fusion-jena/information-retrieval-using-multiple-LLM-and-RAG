Based on the provided context, there are no specific criteria mentioned for splitting the data when training a deep learning model, such as an LSTM model. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

In the context of land use and land cover change studies, the data splitting criteria are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the data is likely split based on temporal or spatial characteristics. For example, the data could be split based on different time periods, such as training the model on data from 2000-2010 and testing it on data from 2010-2020. Alternatively, the data could be split based on different spatial units, such as training the model on data from one region and testing it on data from another region.

It is important to note that the choice of data splitting criteria can significantly impact the model's performance and should be carefully considered based on the specific research question and data availability.
