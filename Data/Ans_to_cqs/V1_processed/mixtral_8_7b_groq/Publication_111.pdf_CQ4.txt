Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the use of a GRU-DNN model for predicting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH) using lag features. It describes the use of a grid search method to obtain the optimal number of previous observations (K) for the GRU-DNN model, but it does not mention any data augmentation techniques.

However, the context does mention the use of two techniques to address overfitting in the deep learning model: early stopping and dropout. Early stopping involves monitoring the generalization performance of the model during training and stopping the training process when performance starts to degrade. Dropout, on the other hand, is a regularization strategy that involves randomly dropping out a certain proportion of layer neurons during training to train the model with alternative topologies.

Therefore, while data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, the text does discuss other techniques used to improve the performance and prevent overfitting in the deep learning model.
