Based on the provided context, there is not enough information to directly answer the query about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, I can provide some insights that might be related to the topic.

The context consists of several tables and pieces of text about a study related to soil and site parameters. There are statistical measures like standard deviation (S.D.), coefficient of variation (C.V.), skewness, and kurtosis. Additionally, there are correlation coefficients between various parameters, and root mean square error (RMSE) of residuals with a kriging variance.

In the context of machine learning and training models, a validation loss plateau is one of the common criteria used to determine when training is complete. This means that the model has been trained sufficiently, and further training would not significantly improve its performance. The validation loss is a measure of the model's performance on a validation dataset, distinct from the training dataset. When the validation loss stops decreasing or plateaus, it indicates that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the data, and additional training may lead to overfitting.

Although the context does not provide specific information about the validation loss plateau, it is possible that the researchers used similar criteria to assess the performance of their models or statistical analyses. For instance, they might have monitored the performance of their models as a function of the number of iterations, looking for a point where the performance improvement became negligible. Alternatively, they could have used cross-validation techniques to assess model performance and determine an optimal number of iterations or training duration.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, it is possible that the researchers used similar criteria, such as monitoring model performance and looking for a point of negligible improvement.
