The provided context discusses the differences between structured and unstructured data, as well as the differences in computational requirements and interpretability between XGBoost and deep learning models. However, it does not directly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, data annotation techniques for deep learning models can include:

1. Image classification: This involves labeling an entire image with a single class or category.
2. Object detection: This involves drawing bounding boxes around objects within an image and labeling each box with the corresponding class.
3. Semantic segmentation: This involves dividing an image into multiple regions and labeling each region with the corresponding class.
4. Instance segmentation: This is a more advanced form of semantic segmentation that involves not only dividing an image into regions and labeling each region, but also distinguishing between individual instances of each class within the image.

These techniques are used to prepare and label data for training deep learning models, particularly for computer vision tasks. The choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the desired output of the model.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly mention data annotation techniques for deep learning, these techniques are an important part of the deep learning pipeline for working with image and other unstructured data.
