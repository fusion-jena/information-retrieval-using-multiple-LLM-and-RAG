Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, the text does mention the use of various remote sensing data sources, including:

1. Sentinel-2 Level 2A: This dataset provides top-of-atmosphere reflectance data with a spatial resolution of 10 m for Bands 3, 4, and 8, and 20 m for Bands 6, 11, and 12. The acquisition period for this dataset is from July 2019 to June 2021.

2. Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD), Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode, Ascending: This dataset provides C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data with a spatial resolution of 5 Ã— 20 m, resampled to 10 m for the Vertical-Vertical (VV) polarization. The acquisition period for this dataset is the same as Sentinel-2 Level 2A.

3. Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) Surface Reflectance (SR): This dataset provides surface reflectance data with a spatial resolution of 30 m for Bands 1-5 and 7. The acquisition period for this dataset is from July 2012 to June 2014.

4. Landsat 8 Observation Land Images (OLI) Surface Reflectance (SR): This dataset provides surface reflectance data with a spatial resolution of 30 m for Bands 2-7. The acquisition period for this dataset is the same as Sentinel-2 Level 2A.

5. PlanetScope Biannual Surface Reflectance Mosaics: This dataset provides surface reflectance data with a spatial resolution of 4.77 m for Bands 1-4. The acquisition period for this dataset is from July 2019 to June 2021.

It is possible that these datasets were used as inputs to a deep learning model, but the text does not provide enough information to confirm this. Therefore, I cannot definitively answer the query regarding the specific deep learning datasets used in the pipeline.
