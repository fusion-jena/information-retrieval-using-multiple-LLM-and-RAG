The text provided does not give explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of several datasets for training and validation, which can contribute to the model's generalizability.

The datasets used include the PlantClef2015 dataset, which has 113,205 images and 91 categories, as well as other datasets such as MS COCO, Places2, Sport-1M, Visual Genome QA, and ILSVRC 2010. The model was pre-trained using its corresponding leaf data from these datasets. During the validation phase, the softmax outputs from each network were combined using fusion methods such as average or max voting.

The use of diverse datasets can help improve the generalizability of the model by exposing it to a wide variety of data and reducing overfitting to a specific dataset. However, the text does not mention any other measures such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are also commonly used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models.

Therefore, while the use of diverse datasets can contribute to the generalizability of the model, it is unclear from the text whether any other measures were taken to ensure the model's ability to perform well on new, unseen data.
