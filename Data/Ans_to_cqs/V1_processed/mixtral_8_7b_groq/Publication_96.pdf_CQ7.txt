In the process of training a deep learning model for mapping burned areas, the data is split into three sets: training, testing, and validation. The criteria used to split the data are specified in the context.

First, 70% of the samples are used for training the model. These samples are used to define the parameters of the algorithm, such as the learning rate (0.001), batch size (1,000), and number of interactions (7,000). The inputs for classification are the spectral data acquired from the training samples of spectral bands, which are selected based on tests. The Landsat-8 spectral bands used for the classification model of burned areas include red (RED - 0.65 μm), near-infrared (NIR - 0.86 μm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR 1 - 1.6 μm and SWIR 2 - 2.2 μm). Additionally, Landsat bands 2 to 7, NDVI, NBR, and delta NBR are tested.

The remaining 30% of the samples are used for testing the ability of the DNN algorithm to map burned areas in the study area. This step generates an accuracy for each algorithm applied; however, it is biased because it uses the same sample sets to test the model. Therefore, an additional accuracy assessment using those validation points is conducted in the analysis.

The specific criteria used to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets are not explicitly stated in the context. However, it can be inferred that the data is split sequentially, with 70% of the samples used for training and 30% used for testing. A separate validation set is created for assessing the accuracy of the model.

In summary, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training include using 70% of the samples for training and 30% for testing. A separate validation set is used for assessing the accuracy of the model.
