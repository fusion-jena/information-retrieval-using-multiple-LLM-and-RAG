The provided context discusses the use of two specific deep learning models, SLSTM and SGRU, in the context of time-series prediction, particularly for forecasting agricultural product sales and the Pacific decadal oscillation index. However, the text does not explicitly mention the specific purpose of these models in terms of classification, segmentation, or detection. Given the nature of the case studies and the described methodologies, it can be inferred that the purpose of these deep learning models is time-series forecasting.

Time-series forecasting is a type of regression problem where the goal is to predict future values based on historical data. In this context, SLSTM and SGRU models are used to predict sales volumes and the Pacific decadal oscillation index at multiple time scales. These models are chosen for their ability to learn from complex data and their superior performance in time-series prediction compared to other models.

In summary, based on the provided context, the purpose of the SLSTM and SGRU deep learning models is time-series forecasting, specifically for agricultural product sales and the Pacific decadal oscillation index.
