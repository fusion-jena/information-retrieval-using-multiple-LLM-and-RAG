The text provided does not give a direct description of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does describe the methodology used for developing machine learning models to estimate chlorophyll-a predictions, which includes some relevant steps.

First, high-frequency continuous surface water quality data was acquired from water quality sensors deployed in Boyd Millpond. This data was then used to train multiple machine learning models using randomized subsets of training data. The text mentions that 80% of the data was used for training the models, while the other 20% was used for validation. This is a form of split-sample validation, which is a type of cross-validation that can help to assess how well a model will perform on unseen data.

Additionally, the text describes the use of the Optuna optimization algorithm to obtain individual optimized model hyperparameters. Hyperparameter tuning is an important step in developing machine learning models, as it can help to improve their performance and prevent overfitting. By automatically searching the hyperparameter space for the greatest combination of hyperparameters that minimizes the mean squared error, Optuna can help to identify a set of hyperparameters that will result in a model that generalizes well to new data.

The text also mentions the inclusion of high-frequency datasets during the model training phase, which can help the RF model to learn more patterns in the water quality datasets efficiently. This can potentially improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

However, the text does not explicitly mention the use of diverse datasets, stratified splitting, or other techniques that are commonly used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a complete answer to the query based on the information provided.
