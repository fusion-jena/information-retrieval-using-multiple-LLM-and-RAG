I don't have access to the specific deep learning pipeline you're referring to, so I cannot provide you with a definitive list of the datasets it uses. However, I can give you some examples of popular datasets used in deep learning research.

In the field of computer vision, the following datasets are commonly used:

1. MNIST: A dataset of handwritten digits, widely used as a benchmark for image classification tasks. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, all of which are grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels.
2. CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100: These are datasets of colored images, consisting of 60,000 32x32 images in total, split into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. CIFAR-10 contains 10 classes, and CIFAR-100 contains 100 classes.
3. ImageNet: A large-scale dataset of over 14 million images, organized into 21,841 categories. It is widely used for object detection, image classification, and other computer vision tasks.

In other fields, such as natural language processing or speech recognition, other datasets are commonly used:

1. Penn Treebank: A dataset of annotated text, used for tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, parsing, and language modeling.
2. LibriSpeech: A corpus of English speech, used for tasks such as automatic speech recognition.
3. SQuAD: A dataset of reading comprehension questions, used for tasks such as question answering.

These are just a few examples of the many datasets available for deep learning research. Ultimately, the choice of dataset depends on the specific task and the goals of the research.
