Based on the provided context, there is no information about the use of a deep learning model or any cloud platform (such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) for deploying such a model. The context focuses on the description of a crawling tool for gathering data from different SRS products, the features of satellite instruments, and the application of machine learning for satellite data interpretation. However, it does not mention any specific deep learning model or cloud platform. Therefore, I don't have the information to provide an accurate answer to this query.
