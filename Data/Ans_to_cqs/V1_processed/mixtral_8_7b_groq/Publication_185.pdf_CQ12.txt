The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline for butterfly classification is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the AlexNet architecture. AlexNet is a CNN architecture proposed by Alex Krizhevsky that won the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge. It consists of eight layers, including five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers. The convolutional layers are used as feature extractors, and the resulting feature maps are passed through rectified linear units (ReLUs) for non-linearity. The model was trained using stochastic gradient descent and the backpropagation algorithm with the learning rate set to 10-2 for all layers initially. The learning rate was decreased using a step policy. The experiments were performed on a small-size dataset without data augmentation, demonstrating the feasibility of using a small dataset to train deep learning models as long as the parameters are chosen properly. The model performs well in its own validation set, proving that deep learning is a powerful method for butterfly classification.
