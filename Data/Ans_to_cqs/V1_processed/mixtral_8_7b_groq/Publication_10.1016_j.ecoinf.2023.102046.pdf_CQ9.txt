I don't have enough information to determine the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context provided focuses on the description of various convolutional neural network models, their architectures, and training procedures, but it does not mention where the data repository for the pipeline is located. Data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF are not mentioned. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
