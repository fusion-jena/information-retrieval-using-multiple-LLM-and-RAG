Based on the provided context, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. The text discusses a racy assessment that requires certain parameters for image classification using a Random Forest algorithm. However, it does not specify the use of any standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

The context does mention that images were classified using a Random Forest model, which is a machine learning technique but not a deep learning technique. Deep learning typically involves the use of neural networks with many layers, while Random Forest is a bagging algorithm that builds multiple decision trees.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
