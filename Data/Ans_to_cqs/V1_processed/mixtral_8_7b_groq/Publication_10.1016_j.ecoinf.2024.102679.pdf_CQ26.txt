The provided context discusses the use of deep learning in the field of remote sensing for wildlife conservation, specifically in the context of aerial imagery. However, it does not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I will provide a general overview of some common techniques used to address data bias in deep learning preprocessing.

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain characteristics (strata), and then ensuring that each subgroup is proportionally represented in both the training and validation sets. This can help to ensure that the model is exposed to the full range of data variability during training.

2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class in the dataset, either by duplicating existing instances or by generating synthetic instances using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). This can help to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class in the dataset, either by randomly selecting a subset of instances or by using techniques such as Tomek links to identify and remove instances that are close to the boundary between classes. This can help to prevent the model from being overwhelmed by the majority class.

4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a wide range of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population being modeled. This can help to prevent the model from being biased towards specific subgroups or data sources.

In the context of the provided articles, it can be inferred that the authors have taken steps to ensure that their datasets are representative of the populations being modeled. For example, in Lamprey et al. (2020a), the authors use cameras to replace human observers in multi-species aerial counts, which could help to reduce bias introduced by human observers. In Lamprey et al. (2020b), the authors compare an automated high-definition oblique camera system to rear-seat-observers in a wildlife survey, which could help to ensure that the data is collected consistently and objectively.

In Lamprey, Keigwin, Tumwesigye (2023), the authors use a high-resolution aerial camera and a two-step fine-tuning process to enhance the model's performance and gather samples pertaining to each key species present in the region. While the specific techniques used to address data bias are not mentioned, it can be inferred that the authors have taken steps to ensure that their dataset is representative of the population being modeled.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that the authors have taken steps to ensure that their datasets are representative of the populations being modeled. Common techniques used to address data bias in deep learning preprocessing include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
