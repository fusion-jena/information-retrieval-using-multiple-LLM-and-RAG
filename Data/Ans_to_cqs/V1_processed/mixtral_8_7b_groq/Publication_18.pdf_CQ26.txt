The provided context discusses various techniques used to improve the learning process of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the field of computer vision, such as data-augmentation and transfer learning. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

That being said, some of the techniques that can be used to address data bias during preprocessing include:

1. Stratified sampling: This technique is used to ensure that the training and testing datasets are representative of the overall population. In stratified sampling, the data is divided into subgroups or strata based on certain characteristics, and then a sample is taken from each stratum. This ensures that the sample is representative of the overall population in terms of those characteristics.
2. Oversampling: This technique is used when the dataset is imbalanced, meaning that one class has significantly more examples than the other class. Oversampling involves creating more examples of the minority class by either duplicating existing examples or generating synthetic examples using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Undersampling: This technique is also used when the dataset is imbalanced, but instead of creating more examples of the minority class, it involves reducing the number of examples of the majority class. This can be done randomly or by selecting only the most informative examples.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the overall population. This can help to reduce bias by ensuring that the dataset includes examples of all relevant subgroups.

It's important to note that while these techniques can help to reduce bias during preprocessing, they are not a substitute for addressing bias in the data collection process itself. Bias in the data collection process can lead to biased models, even if the preprocessing is done correctly. Therefore, it's important to ensure that the data collection process is as unbiased as possible.
