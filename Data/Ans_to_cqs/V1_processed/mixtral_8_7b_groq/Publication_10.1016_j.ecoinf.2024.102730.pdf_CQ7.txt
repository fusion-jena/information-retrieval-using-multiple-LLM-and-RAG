The data was split into a training set and a test set, with the sizes being 80% and 20% of the total data respectively. This split ensures that the models are trained on one portion of the data and tested on a separate, previously unseen portion, allowing for an assessment of their ability to generalize to new, unseen data accurately. This is a common practice in machine learning, including deep learning, to assess the performance and avoid overfitting. No explicit mention of a validation set was made in the provided context. In some cases, the data might be split into three sets: training, validation, and test, where the validation set is used during the model training process to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model on the training set. However, based on the provided context, the data was split only into training and test sets for the deep learning models.
