The specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the article is not mentioned in the provided context. However, it is stated that supplementary data can be found online at <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2024.102516>. This could potentially include the deep learning pipeline data. Additionally, authors often use general data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF to share their data. Therefore, I would recommend checking these repositories for the deep learning pipeline data associated with the article. If it is not available in these repositories, I would suggest contacting the authors directly to inquire about the availability and location of the data.
