Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in the study "Verification of novel integrations of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning neural network for flood susceptibility mapping" by Cai et al. (2021). However, there are some measures commonly used to enhance the generalizability of deep learning models that are worth mentioning.

One common approach is to use a diverse dataset that covers a wide range of variations in the input features and the output labels. This can help the model learn the underlying patterns in the data more effectively and reduce overfitting. In the context of flood susceptibility mapping, a diverse dataset might include data from different regions, with varying topography, land use, and climate conditions.

Another approach is to use cross-validation, which involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets and training the model on each subset while testing it on the remaining data. This can help assess the model's performance on unseen data and reduce the risk of overfitting.

Stratified splitting is another technique that can be used to ensure that the training and testing datasets are representative of the overall population. This involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain criteria (e.g., flood-prone areas vs. non-flood-prone areas) and then randomly selecting samples from each subgroup to form the training and testing datasets.

Overall, while the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in the study by Cai et al. (2021) are not explicitly stated in the provided context, the aforementioned techniques are commonly used to enhance the generalizability of deep learning models.
