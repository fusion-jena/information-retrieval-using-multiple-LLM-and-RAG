The study by Dujardin and Lehning (2022) on downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography using deep learning does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of their model. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that some steps were taken to assess the model's performance and applicability.

Firstly, the authors used two different datasets, WorldClim and CHELSA, to train and test their model. This allowed them to evaluate the model's ability to generalize across different data sources.

Secondly, they employed cross-validation techniques to assess the model's performance. Specifically, they used five decays (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1) and sizes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) for cross-validation. This process involves dividing the dataset into subsets, training the model on one subset, and testing it on another. By repeating this process with different subsets, the authors could estimate the model's performance on unseen data.

Thirdly, the authors used a diverse set of physiographic descriptors to train their model. These descriptors included altitude, distance to the coast, slope, aspect, and others. By using a wide range of predictors, the authors ensured that their model was not overfitting to any particular feature.

Lastly, the authors evaluated the relative importance of each predictor variable for their model. This allowed them to identify which variables were most influential in the model's predictions. By focusing on these important variables, the authors could ensure that their model was making predictions based on relevant features.

In summary, while the study does not explicitly mention the use of techniques such as diverse dataset, stratified splitting, or other common methods for ensuring generalizability, it does employ cross-validation, uses a diverse set of predictors, and evaluates the relative importance of each predictor. These steps suggest that the authors took some measures to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model.
