Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses data augmentation in the context of training data for image classification, but it does not specify the methods used.

However, it does mention that training data augmentation enhances the generalization capabilities of the model. This suggests that some form of data augmentation was used, but the specific techniques are not provided.

Additionally, the text discusses strategies for improving classification accuracy, such as excluding outliers, refining training samples, and changing the proportion of training and test data. These strategies could be considered as part of a data augmentation approach, but they are not the typical techniques of flipping, rotating, or scaling.

Therefore, while data augmentation was used in the deep learning pipeline, the specific techniques are not mentioned in the provided context.
