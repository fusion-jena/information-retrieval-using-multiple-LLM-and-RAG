I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include any information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the description of the depth-attention YOLOv5 model, its architecture, and its application in a specific study. However, it does not mention where the code for this model is hosted or if it is publicly available.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query. I recommend checking the paper's citation or contacting the authors for more information about the code repository.
