The provided context does not give information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of a hybrid MCMC algorithm and a genetic algorithm (GA) for precision agriculture (PA), but it does not specify the type of data being used. The GA generates random combinations of initial values from the first quarter of values stored in a Python dictionary, and each best fit value is considered as an expected value of a Gaussian distribution. However, it is not clear what these values represent or what type of data they originated from. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
