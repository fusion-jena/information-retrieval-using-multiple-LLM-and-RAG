The provided context does not directly address the use of strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does discuss the importance of data curation and image annotation in the development of artificial intelligence tools for organism detection and identification in marine imagery.

In the context of deep learning, randomness can be introduced in various stages of the pipeline, such as data shuffling, weight initialization, and dropout regularization. A common practice to ensure reproducibility and handle randomness is the use of a fixed random seed value. This ensures that the same random events are generated every time the model is trained, allowing for consistent results and comparisons between different runs.

In the context of marine imaging and ecological informatics, the focus is on the definition of the target population and the handling of potential biases introduced by reusing images and annotations as training data. While not directly addressing randomness, these strategies contribute to the overall robustness and reliability of the deep learning models.

For example, Durden et al. (2021) discuss the importance of defining the target population in image capture to identify and potentially mitigate biases in the identification of organisms. This process involves specifying the planned type of quantification, the desired statistical comparisons, and the spatial and temporal extent of the study. By carefully defining the target population, researchers can ensure that the data used for training the deep learning models are representative and unbiased, which indirectly contributes to handling randomness by reducing variability due to non-representative data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value, it does emphasize the importance of data curation, image annotation, and defining the target population in the development of deep learning models for marine imagery. These strategies contribute to the overall robustness and reliability of the models, helping to minimize the impact of randomness and ensure reproducible results.
