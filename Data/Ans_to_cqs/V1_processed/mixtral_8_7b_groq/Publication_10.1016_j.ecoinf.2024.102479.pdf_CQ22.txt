The specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (Artificial Neural Network) are not provided in the context. However, it is mentioned that the performance of the models was assessed using k-fold cross-validation, which is a widely used evaluation method in machine learning. This technique involves dividing the dataset into k subsets, some of which are used for training the model while the others are used for evaluating its performance.

In the study, the dataset was split into two distinct sets, with 70% of the dataset designated for model training and the remaining 30% used as a testing dataset. This approach ensured that the model was trained on a sufficient amount of data while also providing an independent dataset for testing.

Moreover, the context provides information about the hyperparameters tuned for each algorithm, including the deep learning model. For the Artificial Neural Network, the tuned parameters include the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons per layer, and the threshold. However, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model are not specified.

Therefore, while the study provides information on the methodology used to evaluate the models, it does not specify the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
