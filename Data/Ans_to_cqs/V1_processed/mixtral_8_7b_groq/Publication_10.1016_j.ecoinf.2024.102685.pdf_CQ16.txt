Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The text focuses on the methods used for statistical analysis, specifically random forest classification, and the evaluation of the model's performance using metrics like overall accuracy, producer accuracy, and user accuracy. However, it does not mention any details about the training process or the early stopping criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
