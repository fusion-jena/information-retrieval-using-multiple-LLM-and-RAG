The provided context does not contain specific information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. However, it does contain a reference to a paper titled "Deep Learning for Image Recognition," which may include the required information.

The paper discusses various aspects of deep learning models for image recognition tasks. It explains the architecture of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are widely used for image recognition, and their training process. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models.

Hyperparameters are crucial in deep learning models as they control the training process and can significantly impact the model's performance. Common hyperparameters in deep learning models include:

1. Learning rate: The step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function.
2. Optimizer: An algorithm used to update the model's weights based on the gradient of the loss function.
3. Batch size: The number of training examples used in one iteration.
4. Number of epochs: The number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.
5. Regularization techniques: Methods to prevent overfitting, such as L1 and L2 regularization.

Without access to the specific paper or additional context, it is impossible to provide the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it is essential to consider these hyperparameters when implementing and training deep learning models for image recognition tasks.
