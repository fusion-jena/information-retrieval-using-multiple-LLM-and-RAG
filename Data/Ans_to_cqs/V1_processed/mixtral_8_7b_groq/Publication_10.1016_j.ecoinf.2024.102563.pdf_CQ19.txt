Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) used in the studies. However, some studies do mention the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and random forests (RFs), which can be implemented using various deep learning frameworks.

In the study by Mohammadi and Toomanian (2016), they developed a database extension for digital soil mapping using artificial neural networks (ANNs), but they do not mention the specific deep learning framework used. Similarly, in the study by Zhu et al. (2008), they discuss purposive sampling for digital soil mapping for areas with limited data using ANNs, but again, the specific deep learning framework is not mentioned.

In the study by Zhong et al. (2019), they propose a deep learning-based multi-temporal crop classification method, but they do not specify the deep learning framework used. In the study by Zhu and Yang (2022), they identify soybean based on Sentinel-1/2 SAR and MSI imagery using a deep learning model, but the specific deep learning framework is not mentioned.

On the other hand, the study by Breiman (2001) discusses random forests (RFs), which is a machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression tasks. RFs can be implemented using various deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. However, Breiman's paper does not mention any specific deep learning framework.

Therefore, while the studies do mention the use of ANNs and RFs, they do not explicitly mention the specific deep learning frameworks used. It is possible that the authors used various deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or others, but this information is not provided in the given context.
