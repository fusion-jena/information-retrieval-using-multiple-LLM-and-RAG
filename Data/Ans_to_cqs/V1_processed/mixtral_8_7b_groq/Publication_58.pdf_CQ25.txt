Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is land use and land cover (LULC) classification. The deep learning models are used to classify different types of land use and land cover by analyzing satellite images. This is evident from the fact that multiple deep learning architectures, except AlexNet, outperformed XGBoost in the LU detection task with significant differences. The best performing "single-pixel" and "semantic labeling" architectures were selected for the remainder of the study, and these architectures were chosen based on their F1-score for the LU classification.

Additionally, the context mentions that the deep learning models were employed for remote sensing tasks, which further supports the idea that the purpose of the deep learning model is LULC classification. The models were able to extract complex decision rules from large amounts of training data, which is crucial for accurate LULC classification.

It is also worth noting that the deep learning models were used in conjunction with neo-channels and multiple texture filters, including dissimilarity, entropy, homogeneity, and mean. These filters were used to process 64 Ã— 64 windows of input data, and the filters were applied to label the central pixel. The training data used for the deep learning models were the same as those used for other deep learning architectures.

Furthermore, the deep learning models were used to analyze satellite images from which clouds and shadows were masked. The different classes in the satellite images were renamed from 0 to 12, where class 0 contained clouds and shadows and was ignored during the learning process. This shows that the deep learning models were able to handle complex data inputs and make accurate classifications based on the available data.

In summary, based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is land use and land cover classification. The models were able to extract complex decision rules from large amounts of training data and handle complex data inputs, making them effective for LULC classification.
