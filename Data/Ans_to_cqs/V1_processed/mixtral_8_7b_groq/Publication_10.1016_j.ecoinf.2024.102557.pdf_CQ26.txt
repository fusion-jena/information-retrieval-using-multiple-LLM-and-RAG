The provided context does not contain specific information about addressing data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of machine learning algorithms and techniques in ecological studies, which can be used to address data bias.

In general, there are several techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These techniques include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain characteristics, such as class labels, and then randomly selecting samples from each subgroup to create the training, validation, and testing sets. This helps ensure that each set is representative of the overall dataset and reduces the risk of bias.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of samples in the minority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by duplicating existing samples or by generating new synthetic samples using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of samples in the majority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of samples from the majority class or by using techniques such as Tomek links to remove samples that are close to the boundary between classes.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population being studied. This can help reduce bias by ensuring that the dataset includes a wide range of characteristics and variations.

In the context of ecological studies, these techniques can be used to address data bias in datasets related to conservation and environmental evidence, fungal productivity, biodiversity estimation, and other areas. For example, in the study by Cejka et al. (2020), the authors used machine learning algorithms to predict the potential effects of climate change on truffle cultivation in Central Europe. To ensure the accuracy of their predictions, they used a diverse dataset that included data from multiple sources and regions.

In summary, while the provided context does not specifically mention techniques for addressing data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such techniques are commonly used in machine learning and can be applied to ecological studies to ensure the accuracy and representativeness of the dataset.
