The deep learning pipelines discussed in the provided context use several different datasets for training and testing the models. The most prominent datasets mentioned are ImageNet, AudioSet, and AnuraSet.

ImageNet is a large-scale image dataset that is used to pre-train models like ResNet152-V2, VGG16, and ResNet50. It contains over 14 million images belonging to 1000 classes, and it has been widely used as a benchmark for image classification tasks.

AudioSet, on the other hand, is a large-scale audio dataset that is used to pre-train models like VGGish and YAMNet. It contains over 2 million audio clips belonging to 527 classes, and it has been used as a benchmark for audio classification tasks.

AnuraSet is a dataset of anuran (frog and toad) calls that is used to evaluate the performance of the different models. It contains over 10,000 anuran calls belonging to 10 classes, and it is used to generate UMAP plots for different embedding layers of different embedding models.

Additionally, the BirdNet model is trained on data from the target modality (audio) and a related domain (bird vocalisations from focal recordings, also annotated at species level).

It's worth noting that some models are pre-trained on one dataset and then fine-tuned on another dataset for a specific task. For example, ResNet50 is pre-trained on ImageNet and then fine-tuned for frog and bird species identification from acoustic data. Similarly, VGGish is pre-trained on AudioSet and then used to detect coarse-grained sound events in a PAM dataset.

In summary, the deep learning pipelines discussed in the provided context use several different datasets, including ImageNet, AudioSet, and AnuraSet, for training and testing the models. Some models are pre-trained on one dataset and then fine-tuned on another dataset for a specific task.
