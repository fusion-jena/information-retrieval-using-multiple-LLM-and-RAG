The provided context does not directly discuss the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide information about the data types, sources, and preprocessing steps used in a specific study related to honey bee flight time and performance.

In this study, various data types were used, including annual 10m resolution raster data for Land Use/Land Cover Map (LULC), 1m resolution raster data for MNT-Lidar, daily 2.5km resolution raster data for weather, and vector data for the Database of Parcels and Declared Agricultural Production (BDPPAD), Geobase of the Québec Hydrographic Network (GRHQ), and Geobase Addresses Québec. These datasets were collected from multiple sources, including the Ministry of Environment and Fighting Climate Change, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food of Québec, and the Québec government's geobase.

The context also mentions that the study performed a cross-comparison based on the ApisFis model and validation data. The matching comparison for 12 sites showed that the field estimations were close to the outcome of the model for some sites, while for other sites, the field estimations were higher or lower than the model prediction. However, there is no information about any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.


The provided context does not contain information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.
