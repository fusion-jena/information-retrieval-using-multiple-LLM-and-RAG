The provided context does not give detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does provide some insights into the steps taken before and after training the model.

First, the dataset was split into three parts: training, validation, and testing, with 60% of the data used for training, 20% for validation, and the remaining 20% for testing. The deep learning models were trained on resized patches of images, with all patches converted into a uniform size of 256 Ã— 256 pixels. After training, the model predicted the class label for each patch, and the weighted majority voting technique was used to predict the class label of the image from the predicted labels.

The experiments were conducted on a desktop computer with specific hardware and software configurations. The deep learning models were developed using Python 3.8 and Tensorflow 2.4 library, and the models were initialized with pre-trained weights trained on the ImageNet dataset.

Based on this information, we can infer that the deep learning models were likely serialized and saved in a format that could be loaded and used for making predictions. However, the context does not provide information on the specific platform or environment where the model was deployed.

In summary, while the provided context does not give a detailed account of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it does suggest that the model was likely serialized and saved for later use. However, the specifics of the deployment platform or environment are not provided.
