Based on the provided context, there is no information about the optimization of hyperparameters for a model using techniques such as grid search or random search. The text discusses the use of quantitative comparisons and a classification scheme for land use and land cover mapping in historical ecology. However, it does not mention any specific model or its hyperparameters.

The text does mention the use of a manual classification method and the possibility of a finer classification for individual sites or images. However, it does not provide any details about how these classifications were optimized or how hyperparameters were tuned.

Furthermore, the text discusses the propagation of uncertainty in the analysis, but it does not mention any method for incorporating this uncertainty into the optimization of hyperparameters.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the optimization of hyperparameters for a model.
