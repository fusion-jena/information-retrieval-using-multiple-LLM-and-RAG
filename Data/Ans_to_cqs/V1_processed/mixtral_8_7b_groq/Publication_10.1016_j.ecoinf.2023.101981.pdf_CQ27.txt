Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model for detecting cow vocalizations. However, it is mentioned that the data was collected using acoustic recorders and preprocessed with a larger FFT window size to improve the resolution at lower frequencies where cows vocalize. Additionally, cow-specific parameters were fitted in the model, which could explain the detection of a larger number of cow vocalizations compared to a previous study.

Given that the study used machine learning algorithms for detecting ungulate vocalizations, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was likely trained, validated, and tested using appropriate techniques such as cross-validation, and model evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

However, the context does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or deployment of the trained model in a production environment. Model serialization involves saving the trained model in a file format that can be loaded later for making predictions. Platform selection refers to choosing the hardware and software environment where the model will be deployed, such as a local machine, cloud server, or edge device. Deployment involves integrating the trained model into an application or service that can use the model to make predictions on new data.

Therefore, while the context provides information on data collection, preprocessing, and model training, it does not provide enough information to answer the query about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
