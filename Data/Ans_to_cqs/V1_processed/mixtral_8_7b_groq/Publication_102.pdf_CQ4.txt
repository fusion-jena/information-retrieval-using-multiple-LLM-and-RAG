The text provided does not give specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the EfficientNet-B5 feature extractor was used, which was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. ImageNet is a large-scale image recognition dataset that includes various data augmentation techniques during training, such as flipping, rotating, and scaling. Therefore, it can be inferred that these techniques were indirectly applied through the use of the pre-trained feature extractor.

To provide more context, data augmentation techniques are essential in deep learning, particularly for computer vision tasks. These techniques help increase the diversity of the training data, reduce overfitting, and improve the model's generalization. Some common data augmentation techniques include:

1. Flipping: Horizontal or vertical flipping of images, which helps the model learn symmetry and be more robust to changes in orientation.
2. Rotating: Rotating images by a certain angle, which helps the model learn to recognize objects in different poses.
3. Scaling: Changing the size of images, which helps the model learn to recognize objects at different scales.
4. Translation: Shifting images horizontally or vertically, which helps the model learn to recognize objects in different positions.
5. Color jittering: Changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue of images, which helps the model learn to recognize objects under different lighting conditions.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling were applied indirectly through the use of a pre-trained feature extractor. These techniques are crucial for improving the model's performance and generalization.
