Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, the TPEBO-LSTM algorithm used for hyperparameter optimization focuses on preventing overfitting by carefully adjusting certain hyperparameters.

One way to prevent overfitting is by setting the L2 regularization parameter, which helps control overfitting by penalizing large weights. The search range for this parameter is set between 1e-10 and 1e-2, in line with benchmarks from similar studies (Xie et al., 2024).

Additionally, the initial learning rate is set to a range that reflects a balance between avoiding too rapid updates (which can cause instability) and too slow updates (leading to prolonged training). This learning rate determination also aids in preventing overfitting and enhancing the model's generalizability.

Lastly, the number of cells in each hidden layer has a range of 10 to 200, which balances the need to capture intricate data patterns and avoid overfitting.

While these measures do not directly address generalizability techniques like using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, they do contribute to the model's ability to generalize by preventing overfitting.


The context does not explicitly mention the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, the TPEBO-LSTM algorithm incorporates L2 regularization, careful learning rate selection, and a balanced number of cells in hidden layers to prevent overfitting, which indirectly contributes to the model's generalizability.
