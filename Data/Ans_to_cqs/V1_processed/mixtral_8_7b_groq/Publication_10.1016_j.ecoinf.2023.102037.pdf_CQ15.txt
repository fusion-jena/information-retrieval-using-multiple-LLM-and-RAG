The optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline for training the insect detection model is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a momentum of 0.9. This information can be inferred from the context provided, specifically in the section where the training procedure of the detection model is described. The model was trained for 150 epochs, and batches of 16 tiles were fed at a time to the model during training. The default data augmentation techniques of YOLOv5 were applied during training to improve the model's robustness. The optimizer used in this pipeline is SGD, which is a popular optimization algorithm for training deep learning models. It updates the model's parameters by computing the gradient of the loss function concerning each parameter. The momentum term in SGD helps accelerate learning by accumulating the past gradients' direction, which can lead to faster convergence and better performance.
