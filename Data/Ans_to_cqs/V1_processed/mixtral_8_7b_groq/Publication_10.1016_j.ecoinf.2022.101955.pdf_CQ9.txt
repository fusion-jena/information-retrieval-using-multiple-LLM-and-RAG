Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various studies and papers related to image classification, remote sensing data, and machine learning algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), and Decision Trees (DT). However, there is no mention of any deep learning pipeline or its data repository.

The studies mentioned in the context use different datasets for image classification, such as MODIS Global Land Cover products, SPOT-5 HRG imagery, and data from 99 tropical countries. These datasets are used for various purposes, such as assessing change in national forest monitoring capacities, comparing pixel-based and object-based image analysis, and analyzing the response of machine learning algorithms to variations in the spatial distribution of training data.

Therefore, while the context provides valuable information on image classification and machine learning algorithms, it does not mention the data repository of any deep learning pipeline.
