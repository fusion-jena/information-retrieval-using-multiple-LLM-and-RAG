The text provided does not give information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It mentions that the dataset consisted of 35 573 images for each of the 12 channels covering 35 species, resulting in a total of 426 876 images, and that this dataset was split into three sets for training, validation, and testing. However, it does not provide information about where this data can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot answer this question without additional information.
