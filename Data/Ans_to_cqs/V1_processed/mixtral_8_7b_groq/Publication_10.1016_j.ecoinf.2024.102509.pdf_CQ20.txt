The provided context does not contain specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of the "neuralnet" package of R 4.1.2 software for developing a BP-ANN (Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network) model. The BP-ANN model mentioned here is a type of artificial neural network, which is a type of machine learning model.

It is common to use specialized hardware such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) or TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) for training deep learning models, as they can perform the large number of computations required for training these models more efficiently than CPUs (Central Processing Units). However, the context does not provide information on whether such hardware was used in this specific case.

Additionally, the context also mentions that the selection of hidden layers and neurons in the BP-ANN model was determined through a process of trial and error, and that repeated training and testing were necessary to develop an optimal neural network. This suggests that the training of the model may have been done on a general-purpose computer, rather than on specialized hardware.

In conclusion, the provided context does not contain specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It is possible that a general-purpose computer was used, but it is also possible that specialized hardware such as GPUs or TPUs were used.
