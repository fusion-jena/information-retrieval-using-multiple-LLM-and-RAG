The provided context discusses the use of machine learning models, specifically XGBoost and LightGBM, for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) in a study area. However, it does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.

In general, techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a machine learning or deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subsets while ensuring that each subset contains a representative proportion of samples from each class. This helps to ensure that the training, validation, and testing sets are representative of the overall dataset.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of samples from the minority class in the dataset. This can help to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves decreasing the number of samples from the majority class in the dataset. This can help to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population being studied. This can help to prevent the model from being biased towards a particular subset of the population.

It is important to note that the choice of technique will depend on the specific dataset and problem being studied. In some cases, a combination of techniques may be necessary to effectively address data bias.

In the context of the provided study, it is possible that data bias was addressed during the preprocessing stage using one or more of these techniques. However, the provided context does not mention any specific techniques that were used.
