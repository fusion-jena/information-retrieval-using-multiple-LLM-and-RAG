Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. The text does not mention any specific techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization methods.

However, it does provide information about the methods used for the classification of Cerrado physiognomies. The authors employed deep learning techniques, including data augmentation techniques, a sliding window approach, and semantic segmentation. They also used a hierarchical process for the classification, dividing it into two levels. The first level classified the samples into forest, grassland, and savanna, while the second level further classified the savanna and grassland maps.

The authors used the RGB+EVI2 dataset for the first level of classification and reported the precision, recall, and F1-score for each class. They achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 92.8%.

Therefore, while the context provides details about the classification methods and accuracy metrics, it does not explicitly mention the hyperparameter optimization techniques used in the study.
