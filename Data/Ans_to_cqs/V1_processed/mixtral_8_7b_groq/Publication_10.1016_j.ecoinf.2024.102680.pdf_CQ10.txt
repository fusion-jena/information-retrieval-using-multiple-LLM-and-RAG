I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context consists of an excerpt from an academic paper that discusses the development and performance evaluation of the Underwater Object Detection Network (UODN) algorithm for detecting and monitoring underwater organisms. While the paper offers insights into the architecture, parameters, and results of the UODN algorithm, it does not provide information about the code repository or its location on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
