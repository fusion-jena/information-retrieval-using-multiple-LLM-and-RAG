The text provided does not give specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of the Dropout layer to mitigate overfitting, which can be considered a form of regularization and not a data augmentation technique.

Data augmentation techniques are used to increase the diversity of the training data by applying random transformations to the images, such as flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping. These techniques can help improve the model's ability to generalize and reduce overfitting.

In the context of counting pollen-bearing bees, data augmentation techniques could be useful to increase the size and diversity of the VnPollenBee dataset. For example, flipping the images horizontally could help the model learn to count pollen-bearing bees regardless of their orientation. Rotating and scaling the images could help the model learn to count bees in different positions and distances from the camera.

Therefore, while the text does not provide specific information about the data augmentation techniques used, it is reasonable to assume that some data augmentation techniques were applied to the VnPollenBee dataset to improve the model's performance.
