The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. The deep learning model used in the study is AlexNet, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers. The model also includes Local Response Normalization (LRN) processing, Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function processing, and mean pooling downsampling operation.

The study focuses on reducing time and personnel costs in wildlife surveys using camera traps by automatically filtering empty images. The authors propose an adaptive deep learning method that uses small-scale training sets and a commonly-available desktop personal computer (PC) to achieve automatic filtering of empty camera images. The study compares the recognition rate of their method with another study, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
