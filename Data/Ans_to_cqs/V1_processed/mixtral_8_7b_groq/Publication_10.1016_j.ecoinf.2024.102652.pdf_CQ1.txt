Based on the provided article information, the deep learning pipeline for creating soil salinity maps utilizes remote sensing data as the primary source of raw data. Specifically, the process involves applying semantic segmentation to an image through the MU-NET deep learning method. However, the article does not explicitly mention other data collection methods such as surveys or public datasets.

Remote sensing is a technique that involves gathering data about the Earth's surface and atmosphere through the use of sensors on satellites, aircraft, or drones. These sensors capture various types of electromagnetic radiation, which can be used to create images and extract information about the observed area. In the context of the article, remote sensing is used to collect data on soil salinity, which is then processed using the MU-NET deep learning method.

The MU-NET method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify each pixel of an image into a specific category, such as "saline soil" or "non-saline soil." To do this, the network requires a large dataset of labeled images, which are used to train the model to recognize patterns and make predictions. In this case, the training set consists of remote sensing data that has been normalized and standardized to fit into the network.

The training process involves using a batch size of 32, which is a hyperparameter that determines how many samples are processed at once. This value was chosen to balance memory usage and computer resource utilization. The optimizer used in the training process is Adam, which is a popular optimization algorithm for deep learning models. The learning rate is varied based on the cosine function's law, which helps the model converge more efficiently. The loss function used is cross-entropy, which measures the difference between the predicted and actual outputs.

Overall, the deep learning pipeline for creating soil salinity maps relies on remote sensing data as the primary source of raw data. While the article does not explicitly mention other data collection methods, it is possible that other sources of data were used in conjunction with remote sensing to create the final maps.
