The provided context does not include information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The methods were written in the Python language and in the PyCharm environment on a machine, and the Keras library with Tensorflow backend was used for developing the learning methods. However, there is no mention of the deployment platform. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
