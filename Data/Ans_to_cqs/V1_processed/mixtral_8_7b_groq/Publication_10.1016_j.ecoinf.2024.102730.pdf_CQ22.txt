The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in this study are Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Average Error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (R²). These metrics are commonly used in regression problems to assess the accuracy and generalization ability of models. MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values, while MAE calculates the average absolute difference. R², on the other hand, determines the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. Before conducting the grid search for hyperparameter optimization, the data was divided into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%). This split ensures that the models are trained on one portion of the data and tested on a separate, previously unseen portion, allowing for an accurate assessment of their ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
