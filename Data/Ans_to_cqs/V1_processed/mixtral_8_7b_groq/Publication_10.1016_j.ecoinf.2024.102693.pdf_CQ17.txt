The provided context discusses two regularization strategies used in deep learning models: Cutmix and Mixup. These methods are used to prevent overfitting and improve the performance of classifiers by encouraging the model to learn more robust features.

Cutmix is a regularization strategy proposed by Yun et al. (2019) that involves randomly cutting and pasting patches between images in a training dataset. During training, Cutmix creates a new image by combining two images and their corresponding labels. This approach helps the model to focus on localizable features and improves its ability to generalize.

Mixup is another regularization method proposed by Zhang et al. (2017) that creates a new training sample by linearly interpolating between two random images and their labels. Mixup encourages the model to learn a smooth decision boundary and reduces overfitting by providing a diverse set of training examples.

In addition to Cutmix and Mixup, other regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Dropout is a technique that randomly sets a fraction of the neurons in a layer to zero during training, preventing over-reliance on specific neurons and reducing overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that encourages the model to learn smaller weights, reducing the risk of overfitting.

The context also discusses various deep learning models, including ResNet-50, ViT-S/16, Volo-d1, and ViP-Small/7. These models use different hyperparameters for transfer training, such as learning rate, batch size, and weight decay, which can affect their performance and susceptibility to overfitting.

In summary, Cutmix and Mixup are two regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Other regularization methods, such as dropout and L2 regularization, are also commonly used. The choice of hyperparameters for transfer training can affect the performance and susceptibility to overfitting of deep learning models.
