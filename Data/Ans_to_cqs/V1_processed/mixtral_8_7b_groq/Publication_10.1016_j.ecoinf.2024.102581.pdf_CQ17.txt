In the context of deep learning, overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on unseen data, such as validation or test sets. Regularization methods are employed to prevent overfitting by introducing a penalty term or modifying the model architecture to reduce the complexity and improve generalization. Two common regularization techniques are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization method specifically designed for neural networks. During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction of neurons in a layer to zero, preventing them from contributing to both the forward pass and the subsequent weight updates. This process helps to promote independence among the neurons and reduces the co-adaptation of features, which can lead to overfitting. The context provided mentions dropout as a method to improve the model's generalizability and reduce the gap between training and validation results.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a technique that adds a penalty term to the loss function, proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. By increasing the loss for larger weights, L2 regularization encourages the model to distribute the importance of features more evenly and avoid overemphasizing specific training examples. This, in turn, helps to reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

The provided context discusses the optimization of hyperparameters in a deep learning model, including the number of neurons and the optimization algorithm. However, it does not explicitly mention L2 regularization. Nonetheless, L2 regularization is a widely used and well-established method for preventing overfitting in deep learning models.

In summary, dropout and L2 regularization are two common regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Dropout is a method that randomly sets a fraction of neurons in a layer to zero during training, promoting independence and reducing co-adaptation. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging the model to distribute the importance of features more evenly and avoid overemphasizing specific training examples.
