Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of a specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer being used in the described pipeline. The focus of the text is on the integration of machine learning and deep learning methodologies for modeling and predicting animal movement, specifically in the context of T-maze experiments.

The pipeline described includes the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM), which is a type of machine learning algorithm, but not a deep learning model. The SVM model is applied to a dataset that has been reduced dimensionally using a method that retains the majority of the original data's variance. The selection of the distance metric and the number of dimensions for the dataset is based on the data's characteristics and analytical requirements.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
