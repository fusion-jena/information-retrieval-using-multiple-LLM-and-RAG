Based on the information provided, there is no specific mention of the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it is stated that the training of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can terminate early if there is no improvement in the validation error after a certain number of epochs. This is a common practice in machine learning to prevent overfitting.

In the context of this information, the training process likely monitors the performance on a validation set after each epoch. If the performance on the validation set does not improve for a certain number of epochs, the training process will stop early. This number of epochs without improvement is not specified in the context provided.

It is also worth noting that the CNN's performance metrics are reported for three different tasks: predicting river age, sea age, and spawning. The performance metrics used are mean square error (MSE), mean average percentage error (MAPE), and average accuracy (%). The choice of performance metric depends on the specific task and the nature of the data. For regression tasks such as predicting river age and sea age, MSE and MAPE are appropriate metrics. For the classification task of predicting spawning, accuracy is an appropriate metric.

Finally, the context mentions that a relatively small number of training examples in infrequent age classes can lead to lower accuracy when compared with the more abundant age classes. This is a common issue in imbalanced datasets and can be addressed by using techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or generating synthetic samples. However, these techniques are not mentioned in the context provided.

In summary, while the exact criteria for determining when training is complete are not specified in the context provided, it is likely that the training process monitors the performance on a validation set and stops early if there is no improvement for a certain number of epochs. The choice of performance metric depends on the specific task and the nature of the data. The issue of imbalanced datasets is also mentioned, but no solutions are provided.
