Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the methodology and applications of ecological informatics, particularly on Land Surface Temperature (LST) retrieval and vegetation biomass density modelling using artificial neural networks. However, it does not provide any details about the code repository or the programming languages used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the code repository.
