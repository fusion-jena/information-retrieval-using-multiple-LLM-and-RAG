The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study used a camera trap dataset for species distribution modeling. Camera traps are sensors that capture images or videos when triggered by movement or heat, and they are commonly used in ecological studies to monitor wildlife populations.

Additionally, the abstract mentions the use of "Bootstrapping, Generalised linear model, Machine learning, Multi-scale, Random forest, Species distribution modelling" as keywords. Bootstrapping is a statistical technique that involves resampling data with replacement to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic. This technique can be used to assess the variability of a model's predictions, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected.

The paper mentions that the camera trap dataset was subsampled by randomly selecting 20% of the presence and absence locations, and that this subsampling was repeated 100 times to produce 100 different probability surfaces. This suggests that the raw data was collected through a systematic sampling design, where a subset of the total study area was selected for camera trap placement. However, the specifics of this sampling design are not provided in the context.

In summary, while the provided context does not give explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that camera traps were used to collect data on wildlife presence and absence. Additionally, it is likely that a systematic sampling design was used to select the camera trap locations, but the specifics of this design are not provided.
