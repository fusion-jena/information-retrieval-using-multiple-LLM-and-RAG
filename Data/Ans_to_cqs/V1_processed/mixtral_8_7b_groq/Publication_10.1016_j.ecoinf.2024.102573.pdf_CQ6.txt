Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps can be involved, including normalization, scaling, and cleaning. The provided context discusses a specific experiment that uses log compression, normalization through Per-Channel Energy Normalization (PCEN), and mel-filterbanks for preprocessing.

Log compression is a common preprocessing step used to reduce the dynamic range of audio signals. In the given context, the authors compare log compression to PCEN and find that PCEN performs better, particularly when combined with a (mel-)spectrogram frontend.

Normalization is another critical preprocessing step that can help deep learning models generalize better. In the given context, the authors use PCEN to normalize the input features, which Gaussianizes the magnitudes and decorrelates the frequency bands. This normalization scheme helps alleviate stationary background noise and strengthens the models against unseen natural and urban noise.

The authors also mention that they applied normalization on the backend's input, which is the frontend's output. This suggests that normalization can occur at different stages of the preprocessing pipeline, depending on the specific frontend and backend used.

Scaling is another preprocessing step that can help deep learning models converge faster during training. However, the provided context does not explicitly mention scaling as a preprocessing step.

Cleaning refers to removing unwanted artifacts or noise from the input data. While the provided context does not explicitly mention data cleaning, it does discuss how the preprocessing steps help alleviate background noise.

In summary, the provided context discusses preprocessing steps such as log compression, normalization through PCEN, and mel-filterbanks. These steps help reduce the dynamic range of audio signals, normalize the input features, and alleviate background noise. While the context does not explicitly mention scaling or cleaning, these steps can also be important preprocessing steps for training deep learning models.
