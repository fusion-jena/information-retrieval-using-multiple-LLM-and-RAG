The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for the study. However, it does mention some of the datasets used in the study, which I will describe below.

The study uses several remote sensing datasets, including Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS), Soil Moisture Storage (SMS), and Groundwater Storage (GWS). These datasets are obtained from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) with a spatial resolution of 0.25 x 0.25 degrees and a temporal resolution of monthly.

Additionally, the study uses the Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) at 3, 6, and 12-month timescales. The SPEI is a drought index that considers both precipitation and temperature to estimate evapotranspiration.

The study also uses several global climate indices, including El-Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). These indices describe large-scale climate patterns that can influence weather and climate at regional and local scales.

The context does not provide information on how these datasets were created or what methods were used to collect the raw data. However, remote sensing datasets like GLDAS are typically created by combining data from multiple sources, including satellite observations, ground-based measurements, and numerical models.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that a combination of remote sensing, ground-based measurements, and numerical models were used to create the datasets used in the study.
