The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This information is provided in the context in the section about data pre-processing, where it mentions that the data is split into smaller areas of 80 Ã— 80 pixels "due to limitations in the available amount of overfitting" and that these samples are used to train a CNN. Additionally, the section on Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) provides a more detailed explanation of the concept of CNNs, further confirming that this type of model is used in the pipeline.
