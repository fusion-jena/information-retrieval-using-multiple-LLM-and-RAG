The provided context discusses data augmentation (DA) as a technique to increase and diversify training data for deep learning models. However, it does not explicitly mention the strategies for addressing data bias during preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I will provide a general overview of some common techniques used to address data bias, including stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.



In deep learning, data preprocessing plays a crucial role in addressing data bias to ensure the model's performance and fairness. Some common techniques used to tackle data bias during preprocessing include:

1. Stratified Splitting: Stratified sampling is a method used to ensure that the distribution of labels remains similar in both training and testing datasets. In this method, the data is divided into subgroups based on labels, and then equal-sized random samples are taken from each subgroup to form the new dataset. This ensures that the distribution of labels in both training and testing datasets is similar, reducing the risk of data bias.
2. Oversampling: Oversampling is a technique used to increase the number of instances of the minority class in the dataset. This method helps to balance the dataset and prevent bias towards the majority class. Oversampling can be done either by randomly duplicating instances of the minority class or by generating synthetic samples using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Undersampling: Undersampling is a technique used to reduce the number of instances of the majority class in the dataset. This method helps to balance the dataset and prevent bias towards the majority class. Undersampling can be done either by randomly removing instances of the majority class or by using more sophisticated techniques like Tomek links.
4. Diverse Data Collection: Collecting diverse data is an essential step in reducing data bias. Diverse data collection involves gathering data from various sources, including different demographics, geographical locations, and cultures. This ensures that the dataset is representative of the population and reduces the risk of data bias.

In summary, addressing data bias during preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline is crucial for ensuring the model's performance and fairness. Techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can help reduce data bias and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.
