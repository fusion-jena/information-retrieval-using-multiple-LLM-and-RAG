I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the methods and techniques used in a study related to herbarium specimen segmentation, but it does not give any information about where the code for this study is hosted. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository. If you are interested in the code, I would recommend contacting the authors of the study directly to inquire about its availability.
