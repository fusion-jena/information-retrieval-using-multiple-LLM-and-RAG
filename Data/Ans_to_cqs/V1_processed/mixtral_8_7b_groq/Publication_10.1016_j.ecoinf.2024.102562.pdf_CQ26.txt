The provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the training and data handling were enabled by resources provided by the National Academic Infrastructure for Supercomputing in Sweden (NAISS) at Chalmers Centre for Computational Science and Engineering (C3SE), High Performance Computing Center North (HPC2N) and Uppsala Multidisciplinary Center for Advanced Computational Science (UPPMAX) partially funded by the Swedish Research Council. This suggests that the data handling was done with the support of specialized computational facilities and research council, which may include measures to address data bias.

In addition, the context mentions that the work for A.S. includes image augmentations such as flip, rotations, and affine transformation. These techniques can be used to increase the diversity of the training data and reduce bias, by creating new variations of the existing images.

Furthermore, the context mentions that the work allows quantifying bacterial populations and detects differences among bacterial communities from different locations. This suggests that the data collected is diverse and representative of different locations, which can help to reduce bias in the data.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions efforts to promote deep learning-based methods for researchers without coding expertise, and this could include efforts to make the data collection and preprocessing more accessible and less prone to bias.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest that measures such as image augmentation, diverse data collection and computational support were taken to ensure the quality of the data and reduce bias. However, it is not possible to confirm without further information.
