Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. However, there are several studies mentioned that use machine learning algorithms for various purposes such as mapping soil salinity, monitoring drought, and predicting secondary soil salinization.

In the study by Aksoy et al. (2022), they analyzed the performance of three different machine learning algorithms, but they did not mention any hyperparameters used in those models. Similarly, Rahimi and Breuste (2021) used an artificial neural network for prognostic modeling of Lake Urmia's drying up, but they did not provide any details about the hyperparameters used in their model.

In the study by Seydehmet et al. (2018), they used a polynomial function Î²(x) in their model, but it is not a hyperparameter of a deep learning model. It is a function used to calculate the approximation coefficients in their model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, there is no clear answer to the query about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. Hyperparameters are important components of deep learning models, and they include learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, and activation functions, among others. However, the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model depend on the problem at hand, the data available, and the specific deep learning algorithm used.
