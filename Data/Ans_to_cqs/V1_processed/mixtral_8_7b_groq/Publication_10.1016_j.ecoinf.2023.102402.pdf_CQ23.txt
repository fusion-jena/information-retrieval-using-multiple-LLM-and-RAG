The provided context does not give specific details about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does mention some techniques used to evaluate the performance of species distribution models (SDMs) in a study involving two marine species, H. guttulatus and H. hippocampus.

The study used the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistics (TSS) to assess the model's performance. These methods are commonly used to evaluate the accuracy of species distribution models (Fielding and Bell, 1997; Allouche et al., 2006). The AUC values range from 0 to 1, where values closer to 1 indicate a higher accuracy of model prediction. The TSS values range between -1 and +1, where a TSS value of +1 means complete agreement between observed and predicted distributions, and values of ≤0 denote no better than random performance.

The study reports high predictive performance for the models of both species, with AUC and TSS values of 0.91 ± 0.02 and 0.68 ± 0.02 for H. guttulatus, and 0.92 ± 0.03 and 0.69 ± 0.03 for H. hippocampus, respectively. The high predictive performance was confirmed by validation using multiple databases.

However, the context does not mention any techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the models, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
