Based on the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets, are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that the algorithms' performance and parameter settings were assessed using a training and test set approach. This implies that the data was divided into two sets: a training set, which was used to train the models, and a test set, which was used to evaluate the models' performance.

Moreover, the authors mentioned using randomized grid search methods for exploring the parameter space, but they did not specify whether this method was used for splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets. Typically, in deep learning, a validation set is used during the training phase to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance and to tune hyperparameters. After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set, which has not been used during the training or hyperparameter tuning process.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it can be inferred that the data was split into a training set and a test set, which is a common practice in machine learning and deep learning. The use of a validation set and randomized grid search for splitting the data is not explicitly mentioned but cannot be ruled out based on the provided context.
