The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that a convolutional neural network is used for classifying landscape photographs, which implies the use of specialized hardware. Generally, training deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, requires significant computational power, often provided by graphics processing units (GPUs) or tensor processing units (TPUs). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that either GPUs or TPUs were used for training the deep learning model in the given research. However, without explicit information, a definitive answer cannot be provided.
