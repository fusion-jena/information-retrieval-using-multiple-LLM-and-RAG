The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context is regression. The deep learning model used in the study mentioned is a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network (ANN) with a 30â€“20-10 architecture. The activation functions used are tansig, tansig, and purelin for the input, hidden, and output layers, respectively. The input factors for this model are population size and GDP, and the predicted output is GHGdwts (greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP).

The study used 70% of the data for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for model testing. The accuracy of the model was determined by the coefficient of determination (R2), which was found to be 81.18 for WTR (water treatment plants) and 90.15 for WTI (water treatment installations).

The purpose of this regression model is to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP based on the population size and GDP. This information can be useful for policymakers and environmental scientists to understand the impact of population size and economic growth on greenhouse gas emissions. The study can help in developing strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining economic growth.

It is important to note that the study does not mention any specific details about the dataset used, such as the time period or the geographical location of the water treatment plants and installations. Therefore, the generalizability of the model's predictions may be limited.

In summary, the purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context is regression, specifically to estimate greenhouse gas emissions per unit of GDP based on population size and GDP. The model can be useful for policymakers and environmental scientists to understand the impact of population size and economic growth on greenhouse gas emissions. However, the generalizability of the model's predictions may be limited due to the lack of specific details about the dataset used.
