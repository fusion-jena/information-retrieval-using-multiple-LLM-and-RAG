The Adam optimizer is a popular choice for deep learning models due to its adaptive learning rate and ability to handle non-stationary objectives. It is an extension of the standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, which updates model parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. Adam, on the other hand, computes individual adaptive learning rates for each parameter, considering both the first and second moments of the gradients.

In the context provided, the Adam optimizer is used with a weight decay of 0.9 and a learning rate of 10âˆ’3 for training the EF and SN models. The learning rate is an essential hyperparameter that controls the size of the steps taken during gradient descent. A smaller learning rate allows for finer adjustments of the model weights, while a larger learning rate enables faster convergence but may result in overshooting the optimal solution.

Weight decay, also known as L2 regularization, is another technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large parameter values. The value of 0.9 for weight decay indicates that a strong regularization effect is applied during training.

The binary cross-entropy loss function is suitable for the given problem since it deals with a binary classification task (i.e., deforestation and no-deforestation classes). This loss function measures the difference between predicted and actual probabilities, encouraging the model to output accurate class probabilities.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline described in the context employs the Adam optimization algorithm with a binary cross-entropy loss function and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting. These techniques work together to train accurate and well-generalized models for the given classification task.
