The provided context discusses the use of Flickr and Pl@ntNet APIs to collect and classify images of flowers, but it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the images collected from Flickr were annotated with tags, location, and description. The Pl@ntNet API, on the other hand, returns a list of likely species associated with classification scores and matching images retrieved from the database.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for computer vision tasks can include:

1. Image-level annotation: This is the simplest form of annotation where the image is labeled with a single class label. For example, an image of a flower can be annotated with the class label "flower."
2. Bounding box annotation: In this technique, a bounding box is drawn around the object of interest in the image. This helps the model to focus on the object and ignore the background.
3. Semantic segmentation: This is a more advanced form of annotation where each pixel in the image is labeled with a class label. This helps the model to understand the spatial layout of the objects in the image.
4. Instance segmentation: This is a further refinement of semantic segmentation where each instance of an object is segmented separately. For example, in an image of a garden, each flower can be segmented separately.

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the Pl@ntNet API uses image-level annotation, where each image is associated with a list of likely species. However, the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline of the Pl@ntNet API are not discussed in the provided context.
