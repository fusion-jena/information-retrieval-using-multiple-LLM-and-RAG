The text provided discusses several measures that could contribute to ensuring the generalizability of a deep learning model for natural systems, although it does not explicitly state which measures were taken. Here are some potential measures based on the context:

1. Diverse dataset: The text highlights the importance of having a diverse dataset for deep learning models. It mentions the potential of using hyperspectral data to divide the 'tree' class into multiple species labels, which could increase the diversity of the dataset. This diversity could help the model to learn generalized features that can be applied to various tree species.

2. Cross-validation: Although not explicitly mentioned, cross-validation is a common technique used in machine learning to ensure the generalizability of models. It involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on one subset, and testing it on another. This process is repeated for each subset, providing an estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.

3. Stratified splitting: The text mentions the challenge of overfitting when using small amounts of training data for tree detection. To address this, stratified splitting could be used to ensure that each subset used in cross-validation contains a representative sample of the different tree species. This could help to prevent the model from overfitting to a particular species.

4. Semi-supervised learning: The text discusses the use of labeled data combined with unsupervised tree delimitation approaches in a semi-supervised framework. This approach could help to improve the model's generalizability by allowing it to learn generalized features on a wider array of training examples.

5. Self-supervised learning: The text mentions the use of self-supervised learning, which relies on unlabeled data to generate training data for supervised models. This approach could help to increase the size of the training dataset, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving the model's generalizability.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly state which measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it suggests several potential measures, including using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, stratified splitting, semi-supervised learning, and self-supervised learning.
