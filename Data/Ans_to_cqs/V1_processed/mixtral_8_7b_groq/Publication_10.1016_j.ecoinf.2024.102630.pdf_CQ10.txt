I regret to inform you that there is no code repository link provided in the given context. The text contains information about a study related to ecological informatics, which uses various remote sensing datasets and performs data processing on the Google Earth Engine platform. However, it does not mention or provide a link to any code repository related to a deep learning pipeline. The authors of the study are listed with their contributions, and there are declarations about the use of AI tools for translation and the absence of conflicts of interest. The data availability section refers to previous studies, but it does not provide any links to code repositories. I hope this information is helpful. If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask.
