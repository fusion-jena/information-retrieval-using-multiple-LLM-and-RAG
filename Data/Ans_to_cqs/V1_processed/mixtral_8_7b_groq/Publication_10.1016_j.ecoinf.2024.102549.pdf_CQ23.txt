Based on the provided context, there are some measures mentioned that suggest an effort to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model for water quality prediction. However, the specific techniques like diverse dataset, cross-validation, and stratified splitting are not explicitly mentioned.

Firstly, the study by Baek et al. (2020) combined a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for predicting water level and water quality. The use of a combined model like this could potentially improve the generalizability by capturing both spatial and temporal patterns in the data.

Secondly, Meng et al. (n.d.) used a CNN model for classifying water bodies based on water quality levels. They categorized research findings based on the timing of policy or management interventions, which could help in understanding the evolving factors and patterns influencing algal blooms over different periods. This deeper comprehension of water quality and algal bloom dynamics could contribute to the development of targeted strategies for the prevention and management of algal blooms, thereby improving the generalizability of the model.

Thirdly, Baek et al. (2020) used pixel-based analysis for predicting water quality, which could help in capturing the spatial variability of water quality. This is important for the generalizability of the model as water quality can vary significantly across different locations.

Lastly, Meng et al. (n.d.) used input from water quality monitoring with band reflectance, which could provide more accurate and reliable data for training the CNN model. High-quality data is crucial for ensuring the generalizability of the model.

However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of techniques like diverse dataset, cross-validation, and stratified splitting. Diverse dataset is important for ensuring that the model can perform well on different types of data. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance and generalizability of a model by dividing the data into multiple subsets and training and testing the model on each subset. Stratified splitting is a technique used to ensure that the subsets have a similar distribution of classes, which is important for maintaining the balance in the data.

Therefore, while there are some measures mentioned that suggest an effort to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model for water quality prediction, the specific techniques like diverse dataset, cross-validation, and stratified splitting are not explicitly mentioned.
