Based on the provided context, the article by Rocha et al. (2024) discusses the use of machine learning methods, specifically Random Forest (RF), to estimate net growth in Atlantic Forest fragments in Brazil. However, the context does not provide information on the deployment of a deep learning model. Instead, it focuses on the configuration of the RF training, which involves setting three essential parameters: the number of random regression trees (ntree), the number of division variables (mtry), and the minimum size of nodes (node size).

Therefore, I cannot provide information on the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection, as it is not mentioned in the context. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
