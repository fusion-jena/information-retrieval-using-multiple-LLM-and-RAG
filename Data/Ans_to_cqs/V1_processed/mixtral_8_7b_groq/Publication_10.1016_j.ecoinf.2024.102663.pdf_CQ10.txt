Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on discussing the importance of fish biomass estimation, the challenges in turbid environments, and the potential benefits of using deep learning techniques for fish biomass estimation. It also covers various aspects of deep learning model training, such as the number of epochs, learning rate, cos_lr, optimizer, and initial learning rate. However, there is no mention of the code repository link. I would recommend looking at the original research paper or contacting the authors for more information on the code repository.
