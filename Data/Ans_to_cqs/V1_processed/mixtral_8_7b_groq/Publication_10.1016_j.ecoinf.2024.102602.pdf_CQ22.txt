The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity (recall), specificity, and F1-score. These metrics are commonly used for classification tasks and are defined as follows:

1. Accuracy (ACC): It measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions. It is a general measure of a model's performance.
2. Specificity (TNR): It measures the proportion of true negative predictions (correctly predicting the absence of Cortaderia selloana) out of the total number of actual negative cases.
3. Sensitivity (TPR) or Recall: It measures the proportion of true positive predictions (correctly predicting the presence of Cortaderia selloana) out of the total number of actual positive cases.
4. F1-score: It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced assessment of a model's performance.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models such as VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0 for the classification task of identifying the presence or absence of Cortaderia selloana in images. The performance of these models is assessed using a 5-fold cross-validation approach, which provides a robust and unbiased estimate of the model's performance while also aiding in hyperparameter tuning for improved overall performance.

In the context of mapping the spatial distribution of Cortaderia selloana, the best results were obtained using the EfficientNetB0 model with a learning rate of 10, achieving high accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. This model correctly classified 97.50% of the images containing Cortaderia selloana and misclassified only 1% of the images without Cortaderia selloana as containing it.

In summary, the performance of deep learning models for classification tasks is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1-score. These metrics help assess the model's ability to correctly predict the presence or absence of a target object in images, as demonstrated in the study of mapping the spatial distribution of Cortaderia selloana.
