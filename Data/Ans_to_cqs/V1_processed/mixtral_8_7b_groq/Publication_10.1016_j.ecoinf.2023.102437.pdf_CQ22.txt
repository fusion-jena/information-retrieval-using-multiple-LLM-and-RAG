The provided context includes a study by Azedou et al. (2023) that compares the performance of different deep learning models for land cover/land use classification. However, the study does not explicitly mention the specific evaluation metrics used for the deep learning models.

However, the study does provide the R2 score, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and signature method as part of their analysis. The R2 score, also known as the coefficient of determination, measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable. A higher R2 score indicates a better fit of the model to the data. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) measures the differences between values predicted by a model and the values actually observed. A lower RMSE indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

The signature method is a pre-selection method used to reduce the dimensionality of the input data. This method is used to select the most relevant features for the model, which can improve the model's performance and reduce computation time.

In addition to the above metrics, other commonly used evaluation metrics for deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances in the data. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a balanced measure of both.

Therefore, while the specific evaluation metrics used in the study by Azedou et al. (2023) are not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that they used the R2 score and RMSE to evaluate the performance of their deep learning models. Additionally, other commonly used evaluation metrics for deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
