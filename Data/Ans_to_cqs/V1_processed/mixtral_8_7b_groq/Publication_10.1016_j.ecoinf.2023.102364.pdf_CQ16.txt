The criteria used to determine when training is complete for the machine learning ensembles used in this study are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that an ensemble of machine learning models was trained using Short-billed Gull presence/absence data from 2014-2015 in Salford Predictive Modeler (SPM) v8.3. It is also mentioned that several established and leading machine learning algorithms were combined in an averaged ensemble to obtain the best-possible prediction and overall synergy from each algorithm.

In general, for machine learning models, training is often considered complete when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving or when the validation loss plateaus. This is known as early stopping. Early stopping helps to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.

Additionally, in the context of SPM v8.3, there are several options for stopping criteria, such as using a maximum number of iterations, a minimum improvement in the objective function, or a maximum time limit. It is possible that one or more of these stopping criteria were used in this study, but the specific criteria used are not mentioned in the provided context.

Another possible stopping criterion could be based on the performance of the ensemble, for example, if the performance of the ensemble on a validation set does not improve after a certain number of iterations or epochs, the training could be stopped.

In summary, while the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the machine learning ensembles used in this study are not provided in the given context, it is mentioned that an ensemble of machine learning models was trained using Short-billed Gull presence/absence data from 2014-2015 in Salford Predictive Modeler (SPM) v8.3 and that several established and leading machine learning algorithms were combined in an averaged ensemble. It is also mentioned that early stopping and performance-based stopping criteria are commonly used in machine learning model training, and it is possible that one or more of these criteria were used in this study.
