Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context focuses on the description of a RF (Random Forest) model, its parameters, and the grid search approach used for optimizing its performance. It does not mention any details about the use of GPUs, TPUs, or any other specific hardware for deep learning model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional context.
