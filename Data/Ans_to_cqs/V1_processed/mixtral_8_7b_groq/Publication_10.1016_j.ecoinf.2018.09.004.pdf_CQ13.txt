Based on the provided context, there is no information to suggest that a deep learning model was used in the analysis of seagrass presence and distribution in the Mediterranean Sea. The methods mentioned in the text include machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with a linear kernel, K-nearest neighbors, and Decision Trees. However, these are not deep learning models.

Deep learning models, also known as neural networks, have a different structure and require different hyperparameters for training. Examples of hyperparameters for deep learning models include learning rate, number of layers, number of neurons per layer, type of optimizer, batch size, and regularization techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, as there is no evidence in the provided context that a deep learning model was used in this study.
