After the model training phase, there are several postprocessing steps involved. These steps include the calculation of various metrics, generating a confusion matrix, and creating saliency maps. However, based on the provided context, only the calculation of metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix are mentioned.

Firstly, metrics calculation is performed to evaluate the model's accuracy and efficiency. In this particular case, two types of accuracy are calculated: producer's accuracy and total accuracy. Producer's accuracy is the ratio of correctly classified pixels of a particular class (burned or non-burned areas) to the total number of reference pixels of that class. Total accuracy, on the other hand, is the ratio of the total number of correctly classified pixels to the total number of reference pixels. In the context, the total accuracy for the training phase is 98.1% for non-burned areas and 95.1% for burned areas.

Secondly, a confusion matrix is created to provide a more detailed analysis of the model's performance. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the classification results, comparing the predicted classes with the actual (reference) classes. It shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. In the context, a confusion matrix is generated for both the training and validation phases. For the training phase, the confusion matrix shows that the model correctly classified 131 out of 200 burned areas and 1962 out of 2000 non-burned areas.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps being generated in the provided context. Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the most important features or regions in the input data that contribute to the model's classification decision. They can be useful for interpreting the model's behavior and identifying any potential biases or weaknesses.

In summary, after the model training phase, metrics calculation and confusion matrix creation are performed as postprocessing steps. These steps help evaluate the model's accuracy and provide a detailed analysis of its performance. However, there is no mention of saliency maps being generated in the provided context.
