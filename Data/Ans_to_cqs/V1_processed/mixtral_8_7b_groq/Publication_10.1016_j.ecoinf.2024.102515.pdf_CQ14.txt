The provided context does not give information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The study mentions the use of a 'guided latent Dirichlet allocation approach' for investigating real-time latent topics of Twitter data during a hurricane, but it does not specify the method used for hyperparameter optimization. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization, but without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to this query. It is also possible that the study used a different method or approach for hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question without additional information.
