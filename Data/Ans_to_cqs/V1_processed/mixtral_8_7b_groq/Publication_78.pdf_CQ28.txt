The provided context does not give information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The deep learning model mentioned in the context is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used for classifying bleached or unbleached corals. The CNN model used is AlexNet, which is a pre-trained model. The training of the model is done offline as the performance of various hand-crafted descriptors and D-CNN models for the first dataset is presented in Table 2. The table shows the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and Cohen's Kappa (Îº) for each technique. However, there is no information about the platform used for deploying the model.
