The generalizability of the deep learning model for pollen species identification was ensured through several measures. First, the dataset was made diverse and extensive, consisting of 35,573 images for each of the 12 channels, covering 35 species, and resulting in a total of 426,876 images. This large dataset is significantly bigger than those used in comparable studies, which had 1,060 (Daood et al., 2016), 13,617 images (Pedersen et al., 2017), or 19,500 images (Sevillano et al., 2020). The ample data provided a robust foundation for training the CNN classifier.

Second, the dataset was split into three sets for training, validation, and testing in the proportions 80 : 10 : 10, which is a common approach for ensuring model generalizability. This stratified splitting allowed for a representative sample of each species in the three datasets, ensuring that the model was not overfitting to any particular species.

Third, to further augment the diversity of the training set, images were center cropped to an equally sized rectangle and augmented in various ways, including horizontal and vertical flipping, adjustments in brightness (12.5%), saturation (50.0%), contrast (12.5%), and hue (20%). These augmentations provided the CNN classifier with a variety of perspectives and appearances of the pollen grains, enhancing its ability to generalize and identify pollen species accurately.

Lastly, the authors based their sample size on previous research, suggesting that a minimum of 200 images per species are required for accurate species identification of phytoplankton (Dunker et al., 2018). However, they found that five out of six species with fewer than 200 pollen grains were classified with an accuracy higher than 90%. Based on these findings, they concluded that between 50 and 100 pollen grains represented a reasonable amount of pollen images on a single channel to be included in the reference library. This conclusion further supports the generalizability of the model, as it demonstrates accurate species identification even with a relatively small number of images per species.

In summary, the generalizability of the deep learning model for pollen species identification was ensured through a diverse dataset, stratified splitting, data augmentation, and validation based on previous research. These measures provided a robust and accurate model for pollen species identification using multispectral imaging flow cytometry.
