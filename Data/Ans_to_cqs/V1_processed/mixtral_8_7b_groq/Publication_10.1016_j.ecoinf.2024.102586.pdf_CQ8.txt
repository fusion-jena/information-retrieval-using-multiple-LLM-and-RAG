I am unable to locate the specific information regarding the code repository for the deep learning pipeline in the provided sources, as they focus on the analysis and results of species abundance. The sources, "Ecological Informatics 81(2024)1025862" and "Ecological Informatics 81(2024)1025866" are authored by R. Gulzar et al., but they do not mention or provide a link to the code repository used in their research. For more information on the code repository, I would recommend reaching out to the authors or looking at other related publications or resources that might contain the necessary details.
