Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was trained using a computer with sufficient processing power and memory to handle large datasets and complex computations.

The study used the XGBoost machine learning algorithm, which is a powerful and efficient algorithm for classification and regression tasks. While XGBoost can be run on a standard CPU, it can also be accelerated using GPUs or TPUs for faster training times and better performance. However, the context does not provide any details about the use of such hardware accelerators.

Furthermore, the study used Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) data, which can be large and complex, requiring significant computational resources for processing and analysis. Therefore, it is likely that the study used a high-performance computer with a powerful CPU and a large amount of memory to handle the UAV data and train the XGBoost model.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, it can be inferred that the study used a high-performance computer with a powerful CPU and sufficient memory for handling large datasets and complex computations. However, there is no information about the use of hardware accelerators such as GPUs or TPUs.
