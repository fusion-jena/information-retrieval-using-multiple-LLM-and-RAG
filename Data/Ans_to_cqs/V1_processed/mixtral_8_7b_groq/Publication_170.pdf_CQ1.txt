The provided context discusses the use of camera traps as a method for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, specifically for wildlife surveys. Camera traps are non-invasive, low-cost, and highly efficient devices that are deployed in the wild to capture images of animals. However, these traps often produce large datasets, making it increasingly difficult to manually classify images. This is where deep learning comes in, as a machine learning method that provides a tool to automatically identify images.

In the study by Norouzzadeh et al. (2018), a camera-trap image dataset containing 200,000 images was used to train a deep learning model to automatically identify, count, and describe wild animals in the images. Of these 200,000 images, 99% were empty images, i.e., images without any animals. Similarly, in a mountainous ecological monitoring system in Northwest China, more than 80% of the camera-trap images were empty images. Automatically filtering empty images from the camera-trap image datasets using computer technologies was essential for this study.

The deep learning model used in this study was the AlexNet model, which includes five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers. Except for the last fully connected layer, each layer performed Local Response Normalization (LRN) processing and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function processing. The first, second, and fifth convolutional layers also performed a downsampling operation using the mean pooling method.

The raw data for this study was collected using camera traps, which are a type of sensor. These sensors were deployed in the wild to capture images of animals, and the images were then used as the input data for the deep learning model. Therefore, camera traps are a method for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, specifically for wildlife surveys.

In summary, the provided context discusses the use of camera traps as a method for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Camera traps are sensors that are deployed in the wild to capture images of animals, and these images are then used as input data for deep learning models to automatically identify and classify the animals in the images.
