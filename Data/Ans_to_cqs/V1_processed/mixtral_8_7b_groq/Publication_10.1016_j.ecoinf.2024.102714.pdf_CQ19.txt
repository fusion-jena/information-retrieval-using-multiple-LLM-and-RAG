The provided context does not mention the use of any specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for building the model. Instead, it is mentioned that a Python implementation of the XGBoostClassifier was used for the classification task. XGBoost is a popular machine learning library that uses the gradient boosting algorithm, which is different from deep learning. Therefore, based on the given context, it can be said that a deep learning framework was not used in this study.
