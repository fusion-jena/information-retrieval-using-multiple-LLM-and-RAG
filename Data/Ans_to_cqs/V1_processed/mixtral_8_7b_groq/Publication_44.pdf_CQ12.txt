The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of a VGG16 network, a type of CNN, for transfer learning on the dataset. Additionally, the use of Atrous convolutions, ResNet-101, and Xception models further supports the fact that CNNs are used in the pipeline. CNNs are particularly suitable for image-based tasks such as semantic segmentation, as they are designed to automatically and hierarchically learn spatial features from images. The pipeline also includes a connected component algorithm, which is a classical image processing technique used for identifying connected regions in images, often following feature extraction by a CNN.
