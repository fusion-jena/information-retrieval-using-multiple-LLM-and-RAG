The context provided does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into subsets such as train, test, and validation. However, it does mention that a 5-fold cross-validation of the training set was conducted for Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) training.

Cross-validation is a commonly used technique to evaluate the performance of machine learning models, including deep learning models. In k-fold cross-validation, the dataset is divided into k subsets or folds. The model is then trained on k-1 folds while one fold is held back as a validation set. This process is repeated k times, each time with a different fold used as the validation set. The performance of the model is then averaged over the k runs.

In the context provided, it appears that the same k-folds were used for both SVM and CNN training, which suggests that the data was split in the same way for both models. However, the specific criteria used to split the data, such as random sampling or stratified sampling, are not mentioned.

It is worth noting that for deep learning models, it is common to split the data into separate train, validation, and test sets. The train set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. The context provided does not mention a separate test set, but it is possible that one was used and not described in the given text.

In summary, while the context provided does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it does mention the use of 5-fold cross-validation for both SVM and CNN training. Additionally, it is common practice in deep learning to split the data into separate train, validation, and test sets.
