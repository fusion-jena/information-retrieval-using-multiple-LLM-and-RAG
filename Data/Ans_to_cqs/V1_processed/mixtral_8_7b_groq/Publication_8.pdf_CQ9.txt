Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The study titled "Detection and annotation of plant organs from digitised herbarium scans using deep learning" was conducted by a team of researchers from the Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre, Palmengarten der Stadt Frankfurt, and the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at Philipps-University Marburg.

The researchers have developed a deep learning pipeline for detecting and annotating plant organs from digitised herbarium scans. However, the context does not mention where the data repository of this deep learning pipeline is available. It is possible that the data repository is not publicly available due to restrictions such as data privacy or intellectual property rights.

In order to access the data repository, one could contact the corresponding author of the study, Sohaib Younis (sohaibyounis89@gmail.com), or the academic editor, Ross Mounce, for further information. Additionally, one could check the affiliated institutions' websites or data repositories, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, for any related datasets or code repositories.
