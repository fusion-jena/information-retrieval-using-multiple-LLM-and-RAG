The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a method called grid search. Grid search is a systematic approach to hyperparameter tuning where a predefined range of hyperparameter values are tried out in a grid-like manner to find the best combination of hyperparameters that result in the best model performance.

In the context provided, grid search is used to evaluate the performance of a data-driven model using each combination of predefined hyperparameters and identify the best hyperparameters. Specifically, for the study, the maximum depth of the tree, the number of trees in the ensemble model, and the learning rate are tuned as the influential hyperparameters.

Furthermore, the hyperparameter tuning of the Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost models is carried out through a 5-fold cross-validation process. During this process, the development dataset is divided into k groups, and one group is used as the validation set while the remaining groups are used for training. This process is repeated k times, with a different group used as the validation set each time. The average performance of the k models developed on the validation groups represents the performance of the machine learning technique for the selected hyperparameters.

The findings of the study reveal that RF models require greater depth compared to XGBoost, while the number of estimators is roughly the same for both models. The learning rate is set to 0.05 for both models. These hyperparameters are optimized using grid search to achieve peak performance for the RF and XGBoost models.

It is worth noting that grid search can be computationally expensive, especially for models with many hyperparameters. However, it is a reliable method for hyperparameter tuning and can result in improved model accuracy and enhanced prediction performance.
