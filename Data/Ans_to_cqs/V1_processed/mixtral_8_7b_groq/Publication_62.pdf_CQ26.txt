The provided context does not give specific information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of annotated notebooks (supplementary materials 2 and 4) which might contain information about the data preprocessing steps.

In general, techniques to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This method involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain characteristics, then splitting each subgroup randomly to ensure a representative sample in each subset (training, validation, and test).
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances from the minority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by randomly duplicating instances or using more advanced methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Undersampling: This method involves reducing the number of instances from the majority class to balance the dataset. This can be done randomly or by using more advanced techniques like NearMiss or One-Sided Selection.
4. Diverse data collection: This approach aims to collect data from various sources, domains, or conditions to ensure a diverse and representative dataset.

In the context of the provided text, the authors developed deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks related to natural history collections. They built CNNs for distinguishing between stained and unstained images, as well as clubmoss and spikemoss images. The preprocessing techniques used to address data bias in these specific projects are not mentioned in the text. To get more information about the data preprocessing steps, one would need to access and examine the annotated notebooks (supplementary materials 2 and 4).
