The provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context focuses on the description of the ESK model, which is a novel deep learning method that fuses Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for fish classification using DNA barcode sequences. However, it does not mention any data repository link where the deep learning pipeline or the dataset used in the study is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
