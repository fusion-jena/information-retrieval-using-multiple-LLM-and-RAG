Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The text mainly focuses on the process of fuel model retrieval after the training of the deep learning (DL) model. It explains how the pre-trained model, which showed the best classification performance with synthetic data, was used to classify real MS point clouds. The classified real MS point clouds were then used as inputs for a decision tree scheme to retrieve the final fuel models.

However, it is generally a good practice in machine learning to monitor the performance of the model during training. This can be done using various strategies such as validation and testing, where a portion of the training data is set aside and used to evaluate the model's performance at different stages of training. This helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and is able to generalize well to unseen data.

Therefore, while the text does not provide specific information about the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training, it can be inferred that some form of validation or testing was likely implemented.
