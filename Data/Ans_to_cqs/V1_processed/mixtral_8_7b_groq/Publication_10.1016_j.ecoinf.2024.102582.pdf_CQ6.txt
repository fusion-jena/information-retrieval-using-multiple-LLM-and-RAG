The provided context discusses the use of remote sensing and machine learning techniques for land use/cover classification and mangrove species identification, but it does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps for deep learning models. However, it does describe some preprocessing steps taken for image classification in general.

In the study by Lassalle et al. (2022), training samples were created and landscape types were extracted using Google Earth Pro. Randomly generated sample points were imported into the GEE API for further analysis and then divided into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio. Post-classification processing was applied to the images, and a manual visual interpretation approach was used to correct the image classification results for mangroves within a 10-km buffer zone extending inland from the coastline.

While these steps do not directly correspond to the preprocessing techniques typically applied to deep learning models, they do involve some data preparation and cleaning. For instance, the random division of samples into training and validation datasets can be seen as a form of data splitting, which is a common preprocessing step in machine learning. Similarly, the post-classification processing and manual visual interpretation can be seen as data cleaning or correction methods, aimed at improving the quality of the data used for analysis.

In terms of deep learning model-specific preprocessing techniques, such as normalization and scaling, the context does not provide enough information to answer the query. However, it is worth noting that these techniques are commonly used in deep learning to improve model performance and convergence. Normalization typically involves scaling features to a common range, such as [0,1], while scaling can involve adjusting features to have zero mean and unit variance.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly answer the query, it does suggest that some preprocessing steps, such as data splitting and cleaning, are involved in the analysis of remote sensing data for land use/cover classification and mangrove species identification. Additionally, it is important to note that deep learning model-specific preprocessing techniques, such as normalization and scaling, are commonly used in deep learning and may be necessary for optimal model performance.
