The provided context discusses a multi-step, semi-automated workflow for image classification using computer vision, particularly in the context of time-lapse camera trap images for ecological studies. However, the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned.

Common data annotation techniques for computer vision tasks include:

1. Image-level annotation: This is the simplest form of annotation where the image is labeled as a whole, indicating the presence or absence of a particular object or class. In the given context, this could be used in the first classification step to determine if an animal is present in the image or not.

2. Bounding box annotation: In this technique, a bounding box is drawn around the object of interest in the image. This helps the model to learn the spatial location and extent of the object. Bounding box annotation could be used in the image classification workflow if the goal is to identify and locate specific animal species.

3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in the image according to the object or class it belongs to. Semantic segmentation provides a more detailed understanding of the image content, allowing the model to learn the shapes and structures of objects.

4. Instance segmentation: This is an extension of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is individually segmented and labeled. Instance segmentation can be useful when multiple objects of the same class are present in an image, and it is important to distinguish between them.

Based on the context, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline might involve image-level annotation or bounding box annotation for determining animal presence/absence and possibly for identifying specific animal species. However, the context does not provide enough information to definitively state which data annotation techniques are used.
