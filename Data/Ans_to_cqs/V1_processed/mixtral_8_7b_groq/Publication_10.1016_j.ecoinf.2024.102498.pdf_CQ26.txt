The provided context discusses various approaches used to improve land use and land cover (LULC) classification, including fusion, pixel-based, object-based, and deep learning techniques. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

Nevertheless, based on general practices in deep learning and remote sensing, we can suggest some techniques that could be used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline for LULC classification:

1. Stratified splitting: When splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, it is essential to ensure that each set represents the true distribution of classes in the entire dataset. Stratified sampling ensures that each subset has approximately the same percentage of samples for each class as the original dataset. This method helps maintain the balance of classes and reduces bias.

2. Oversampling: If some classes are underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to increase the number of samples from these classes. This can be done either by randomly replicating existing samples or by applying data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, flipping, or scaling, to create new samples. Oversampling helps balance the class distribution and reduces bias.

3. Undersampling: Alternatively, if some classes are overrepresented in the dataset, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of samples from these classes. This can be done either by randomly selecting a subset of samples or by using more advanced techniques, such as Tomek links or edited nearest neighbors, to remove noisy or redundant samples. Undersampling helps balance the class distribution and reduces bias.

4. Diverse data collection: To ensure that the dataset is representative of the entire study area, it is essential to collect data from various sources, sensors, and viewpoints. This helps capture the variability in the landscape and reduces bias associated with relying on a single data source.

5. Data augmentation: In addition to oversampling, data augmentation techniques can be used to create new samples and increase the diversity of the dataset. These techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, and adding noise to the existing samples. Data augmentation helps improve the model's ability to generalize and reduces bias.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, they are commonly used in deep learning and remote sensing to address data bias during preprocessing.
