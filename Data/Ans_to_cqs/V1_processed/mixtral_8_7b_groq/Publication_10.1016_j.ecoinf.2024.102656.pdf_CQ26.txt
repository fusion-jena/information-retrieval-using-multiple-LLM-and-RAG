The provided context discusses the use of various statistical models and ensemble methods for predicting the suitable habitats of ungulates, but it does not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss some data preprocessing methods that can be relevant in the context of addressing data bias.

In the study, the authors used a 3:1 train-test split for the occurrence points to facilitate model training. This is an example of stratified sampling, where the data is divided into subgroups based on some criteria (in this case, the occurrence points), and then a sample is taken from each subgroup. Stratified sampling can help ensure that the training and test sets have a similar distribution of data, reducing bias.

Additionally, the authors generated 1000 random pseudo-absence points across the study area, which are crucial for model execution and provide a reference for areas that are unlikely to be inhabited by the target species. This can be seen as a form of oversampling, where the number of instances of the minority class (in this case, pseudo-absence points) is increased to balance the data.

However, the context does not mention any techniques such as undersampling or diverse data collection, which are also commonly used to address data bias. Undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class to balance the data, while diverse data collection involves gathering data from a variety of sources to ensure that the data is representative of the population.

In summary, while the context discusses some data preprocessing methods that are relevant to addressing data bias, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.
