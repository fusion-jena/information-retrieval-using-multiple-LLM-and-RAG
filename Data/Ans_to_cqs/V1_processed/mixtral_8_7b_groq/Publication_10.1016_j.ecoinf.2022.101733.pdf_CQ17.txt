The provided context does not include specific information about regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. These methods are typically used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models by adding a penalty to the loss function or by randomly dropping out neurons during training.

However, the context does mention the use of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in various applications such as food and agriculture policy trends, low carbon steels classification, and glacier segmentation. SVMs are a type of machine learning algorithm that can also be used to prevent overfitting by using regularization techniques. One common regularization method used in SVMs is L1 regularization, which adds a penalty to the absolute value of the weights in the model.

Another regularization technique that is mentioned in the context is the use of a training and validation set according to a 60%-40% ratio. This is a common practice in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model and prevent overfitting.

In addition, the context mentions the use of neural networks in the prediction of chronic kidney disease. However, it does not specify any regularization methods used in the neural network model.

In summary, while the provided context does not specifically mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization in deep learning pipelines, it does mention the use of regularization techniques in SVMs and the use of a training and validation set to prevent overfitting.
