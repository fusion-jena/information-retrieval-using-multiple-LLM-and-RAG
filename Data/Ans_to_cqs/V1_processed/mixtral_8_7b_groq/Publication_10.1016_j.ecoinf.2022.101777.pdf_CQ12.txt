The provided context does not specify the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers in the pipeline. The described methodology mainly focuses on the use of the Random Forest (RF) machine learning technique for image classification. RF is a type of ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to improve the overall performance. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the use of any deep learning models in the pipeline.
