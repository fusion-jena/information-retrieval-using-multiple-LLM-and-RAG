The purpose of the deep learning model discussed in the given context is classification. This is evident in the description of the model's training process, where it is trained using various subsets of the dataset and different combinations of datasets. The goal is to assess the number of recordings necessary to yield satisfactory classification metrics.

Furthermore, the evaluation of the model's performance involves the use of conventional metrics such as confusion matrices, accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, Cohen Kappa, and the area under the ROC curve. These are all metrics commonly used in classification tasks.

The model is designed to act as a toxicovigilance tool, which suggests that it is classifying some form of data into categories related to toxicity or hazard. However, the specific details of what the model is classifying are not provided in the context.

In summary, based on the given context, the purpose of the deep learning model is classification.
