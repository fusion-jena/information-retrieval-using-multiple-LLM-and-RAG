Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, the text does discuss some methods used to improve target tracking in monitoring scenarios, which can be relevant to reducing bias in some cases.

In the context of target tracking, one technique to improve performance is the use of a multiscale feature-extraction network (MSNet) to learn features of various sizes. This addresses the issue of potential matching errors when the scale of the target changes. By incorporating multiscale feature extraction, the model can better handle changes in target size, reducing bias that may arise from oversampling or undersampling data of specific sizes.

Another technique mentioned is the use of the Feature Enhancement Network (FEN) to extract more and richer target information features. By using a deeper network, the FEN can capture deeper features of the target, which helps in addressing occlusion challenges in MOT scenarios. This can help reduce bias caused by insufficient data on targets that are frequently occluded.

Lastly, the text discusses an ablation study comparing different feature matching methods, including Deep SORT, Deep SORT+ORB, Deep SORT+ECC, and the proposed model. The results show that the proposed model outperforms the others in terms of MOTA, MOTP, and IDF1, indicating that the proposed model is better at associating and tracking targets, thereby reducing bias caused by incorrect tracking or mismatching of targets.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing, it does mention methods that can help reduce bias in the context of target tracking. These include multiscale feature extraction, using deeper networks for feature enhancement, and improved feature matching methods. These techniques can help ensure that the deep learning pipeline is more robust and accurate, thereby reducing potential biases caused by insufficient or incorrect data.
