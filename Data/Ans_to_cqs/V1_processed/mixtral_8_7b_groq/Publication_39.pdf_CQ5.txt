The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context are AnnotationsActions, COCO 2017train, and Kinetics-400.

The AnnotationsActions dataset is the primary dataset used in the study, which is split randomly into a train set, validation set, and test set. The test set includes 20% of the video clips of each class, while the validation set includes another 20% of the clips in each class. The remaining clips form the training set.

The COCO 2017train dataset is used to pretrain the Mask R-CNN model, which is a backbone for the FGFA architecture. The Mask R-CNN model is trained on the segmentation dataset, and during the training process, FGFA trains only the head and the RPN.

The Kinetics-400 dataset is used to pretrain the ResNet models, which are used for action recognition. The ResNet models are pretrained on Kinetics-400 dataset, and they are trained for 40 epochs starting with an initial learning rate of 0.001. The learning rate is decreased every 10 epochs by multiplying it with a gamma of 0.1.

In summary, the AnnotationsActions dataset is used for action recognition, the COCO 2017train dataset is used for object detection, and the Kinetics-400 dataset is used for pretraining the ResNet models for action recognition.
