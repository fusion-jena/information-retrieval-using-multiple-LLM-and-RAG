In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning of the data before training the deep learning model. However, there are some implicit preprocessing steps that can be inferred.

Firstly, the data is assumed to be in a format that can be used for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. This implies that the data has been converted into a suitable numerical format, such as a matrix or tensor, and that any necessary data cleaning has been performed to ensure that the data is ready for use in a supervised learning setting.

Secondly, the Layer and Rhodes (LR) formulation used in the model requires a fixed number of dimensions for the embedding size. This suggests that some preprocessing may be required to ensure that the data fits into the required number of dimensions. Specifically, the number of dimensions may need to be reduced or increased to match the embedding size of the model.

Thirdly, for data sets with missing data (gaps), two sets of distances are computed using the models with and without gap reconstruction, respectively. The final distances are then set to the weighted sum of these distances, where the weight is proportional to the number of sites with gaps in the query sequences. This preprocessing step is used to reduce the impact of reconstructed bases (which are guessed, as opposed to being observed) on the final distance.

Lastly, the placement of a query sequence onto a phylogenetic tree is done using dynamic programming to find the placement with the minimum distance between the query and each taxon on the tree. This suggests that some preprocessing may be required to ensure that the query sequence and the phylogenetic tree are in a format that can be used for distance-based placement.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, there are several implicit preprocessing steps that are required before training the deep learning model. These include converting the data into a suitable numerical format, ensuring that the data fits into the required number of dimensions, computing distances for data sets with missing data, and preparing the query sequence and phylogenetic tree for distance-based placement.
