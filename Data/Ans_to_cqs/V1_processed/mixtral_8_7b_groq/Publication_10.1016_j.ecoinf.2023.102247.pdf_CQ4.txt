Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the use of an ensemble modeling approach in the BIOMOD2 package in R to predict the distribution of study species in Australia and the factors affecting their distribution, such as temperature and precipitation seasonality, temperature annual range, and distance-to-roads and distance-to-rivers.

However, I can provide some general information about data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data, such as flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping. These techniques can help improve the model's performance by providing more diverse training data and reducing overfitting.

Flipping involves horizontally or vertically flipping the image, which can help the model generalize better and be more robust to variations in the input data. Rotating involves rotating the image by a certain angle, which can help the model learn to recognize objects in different orientations. Scaling involves changing the size of the image, which can help the model learn to recognize objects at different scales. Cropping involves randomly selecting a portion of the image, which can help the model learn to focus on the most important features of the image.

These techniques can be applied to different types of data, such as images, audio, and text, and can be implemented using various libraries and frameworks, such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.

Therefore, while the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, these techniques are commonly used in deep learning to improve model performance and generalization.
