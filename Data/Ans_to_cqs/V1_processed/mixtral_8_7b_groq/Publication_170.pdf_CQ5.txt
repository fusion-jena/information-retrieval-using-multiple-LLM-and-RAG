The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context are camera-trap images. These images are collected using camera traps deployed in the wild, which are non-invasive, low-cost, and highly efficient for wildlife surveys. However, camera traps often produce large datasets, making it difficult to manually classify images.

In the study, the authors used a Colombian llanos camera-trap image dataset containing 200,000 images, 99% of which were empty images. Additionally, more than 80% of their camera-trap images taken in a mountainous ecological monitoring system in Northwest China were empty images. Automatically filtering empty images from their camera-trap image datasets using computer technologies was essential.

To address this challenge, the authors used deep learning techniques, specifically deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), which have greatly advanced in the field of image processing. Deep learning technology enables computers to learn how to map inputs (images) to outputs (category) of interest with learning algorithms. The DCNN model used in the study was the AlexNet model, which included five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers.

The authors used a small-scale training set of labeled camera-trap images to train the DCNN model on a commonly-available, desktop personal computer (PC). After training, they automatically retrained the model on newly-labeled images in the extended training set to improve its accuracy.

Therefore, the camera-trap image dataset is the primary dataset used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context. The authors used this dataset to train and retrain the DCNN model to automatically filter empty images from the camera-trap image datasets.
