The provided context does not contain information about the specific deep learning model used in the study by Do and Tran (2023). However, based on the title of the study, we can infer that the purpose of the deep learning model is likely to be for the detection of the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming.

The study by Do and Tran (2023) aims to combine a deep learning model with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish. This suggests that the deep learning model is being used for the purpose of detection, specifically for detecting the presence and movement of the early stages of spotted butterfish in the region.

It is worth noting that the specific type of deep learning model used in the study is not mentioned in the provided context. Deep learning models can be used for a variety of tasks, including classification, segmentation, and detection. In this case, based on the title of the study and the context provided, it is most likely that the deep learning model is being used for detection. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a more specific answer.
