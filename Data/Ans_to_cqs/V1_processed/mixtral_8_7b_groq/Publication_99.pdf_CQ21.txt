Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix calculation after the model training. However, it is mentioned that metrics calculation is performed as part of the evaluation of the models.

In particular, the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) is used to assess the quality of the reconstructed herbarium leaves. The SSIM score ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher score indicates better reconstruction performance. The average SSIM scores for the Pix2Pix and PConv models are compared to evaluate their performance.

Furthermore, the models are trained and validated using a total of 2040 and 288 leaves, respectively, while the remaining 596 leaves are used for testing. This suggests that the models' performance is also evaluated based on their ability to generalize to unseen data, which is an essential aspect of model evaluation.

Therefore, while the context does not provide explicit information about postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix calculation, it does mention that metrics calculation is performed as part of the model evaluation process, with a focus on the SSIM score to assess the quality of the reconstructed herbarium leaves.
