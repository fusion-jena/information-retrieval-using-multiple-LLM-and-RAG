The provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study focuses on urban areas with sparse vegetation and various types of land cover such as cropland, irrigated or post-flooding, cropland, rainfed, herbaceous cover, tree or shrub cover, and mosaics of these categories. It also mentions the presence of flooded areas with different types of water (fresh, brackish, saline) and various tree cover types.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the data collection methods used in this study likely involved remote sensing techniques such as satellite or aerial imagery to obtain information about land cover, vegetation, and water bodies. Remote sensing is a common method for collecting large-scale data in urban and environmental studies, and it can provide information on various spectral bands, which can be useful for training deep learning models.

Additionally, the study mentions the use of open data, which suggests that publicly available datasets may have been used in the study. Public datasets can be a valuable resource for deep learning studies, as they can provide large amounts of labeled data for training models.

Finally, the study mentions the use of surveys in the context of validating the model's predictions. Surveys can be a useful method for collecting ground truth data to evaluate the performance of deep learning models.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the data collection methods used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that remote sensing techniques, public datasets, and surveys were likely used to collect the raw data.
