Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model in the study is not explicitly stated as a specific type such as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, it can be inferred that the model is used for predictive modeling of global vegetation cover in a regression setting.

In the study, the authors formulate a new computational setting for regression, where target labels are structurally incomplete. This means that the target variables, which represent vegetation cover in this context, may not be fully labeled or may contain errors. The deep learning model is employed to handle this structurally incomplete setting and make accurate predictions for global vegetation cover.

The deep learning model is compared to other machine learning methods such as neural networks, random forests, gradient boosting, and k-nearest neighbors for PNV (potential natural vegetation) mapping in a classification setting. However, the study specifically focuses on the regression setting with structurally incomplete target labels for predicting global vegetation cover.

Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning model in this study is to perform regression-based predictive modeling of global vegetation cover in a structurally incomplete label setting.
