Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, the text does mention the use of correction methods to represent the four main approaches for modeling species distributions. These correction methods are implemented to represent two methods that consist of estimating the sampling effort to adapt the background set.

One of the correction methods is described in detail, which is the method proposed by Moua et al. (2017). This method aims to reduce the sampling bias by transforming the model input data using four approaches, which can be categorized based on two criteria: the dataset concerned with the transformation (presence sites or background sites) and the implementation spaces of the transformation (geographical or environmental space).

When the presence dataset is considered, the approach aims to modify its distribution to tend toward a uniform distribution, and the background set is obtained via a uniform random selection. The implementation space of such an approach can be either the geographical space or environmental feature space.

When the background set is considered, it is built according to a selection bias that reflects the same sampling bias. The knowledge found in the literature and provided by experts of the ecology of the An. darlingi species is used to parameterize the correction methods.

Therefore, while the text does not explicitly mention postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, it does describe the use of correction methods to reduce sampling bias and improve the model's performance. These correction methods involve transforming the model input data based on the presence or background sites and the implementation spaces of the transformation.
