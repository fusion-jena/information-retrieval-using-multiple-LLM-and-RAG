The text provided does not give explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the study involves the use of a multi-scale feature pyramid network (FPN) and ResNet models with varying numbers of layers (18, 34, 152). The use of an FPN can help improve the model's ability to detect objects of different sizes by combining features from different layers of the CNN. The use of multiple ResNet models with varying numbers of layers can also help improve the model's generalizability by allowing for the selection of the best model for a given task.

In addition, the text mentions that the models were trained using thermal images from UAVs, which suggests that the dataset is diverse in terms of the type of data used. However, it does not explicitly mention whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were used.

In summary, while the text does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it does suggest that the use of an FPN and multiple ResNet models with varying numbers of layers, as well as a diverse dataset, may have contributed to the model's generalizability. However, without more information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
