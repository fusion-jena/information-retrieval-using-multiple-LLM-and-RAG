The provided context discusses various techniques used to address issues like overfitting and data scarcity in the deep learning pipeline for snow leopard re-identification, but it does not explicitly mention the specific preprocessing techniques for addressing data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

However, it does mention the use of data augmentation techniques like left-right mirroring, which helps strengthen the algorithm's capacity to match individuals based on pelt patterns rather than the background. Data augmentation can be considered a method to increase data diversity and prevent overfitting, but it does not directly address data bias.

To address data bias, one could consider techniques like stratified sampling during the data splitting process. Stratified sampling ensures that the train and test datasets have a similar distribution of classes, reducing bias that could arise from an imbalanced dataset.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to handle class imbalance in datasets. Oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class, while undersampling involves reducing the number of samples from the majority class. These techniques can help reduce bias caused by an imbalanced dataset.

Diverse data collection is another approach to reducing data bias. By collecting data from various sources, one can ensure that the dataset represents the true distribution of the population and reduce bias caused by underrepresentation of certain classes or groups.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing, one could consider techniques like stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection to reduce data bias in the deep learning pipeline.
