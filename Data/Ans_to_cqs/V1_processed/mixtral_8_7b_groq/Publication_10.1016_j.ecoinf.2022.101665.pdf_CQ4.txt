The provided context does not contain information about the deep learning pipeline or specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context focuses on methods for assessing the accuracy of thematic maps produced by a calibrated statistical prediction method, specifically addressing the testing phase when data availability may be limited.

Three resampling methods are discussed: cross-validation method 3, method 4, and method 5. In cross-validation method 3, weights are applied to individual observations (inverse sampling intensities) for model validation. Methods 4 and 5 involve computing map accuracy metrics from simulated residuals at the nodes of a grid covering the entire study area.

However, these methods are not directly related to data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning for image processing tasks. Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are used to increase the size of the training dataset and improve model generalization by creating modified versions of the original images.

To summarize, the provided context does not contain information about data augmentation techniques in deep learning pipelines.
