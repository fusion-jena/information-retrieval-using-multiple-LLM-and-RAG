The provided context does not give specific details about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the pipeline uses high-resolution imagery as input data for tree species mapping in tropical forests. The network is trained using a batch of 24 images per epoch for 300 epochs. The type of image files (e.g., JPEG, PNG, TIFF) is not specified. Therefore, based on the given context, the answer is:

The deep learning pipeline uses imagery data, but the specific image file format is not mentioned in the provided context.
