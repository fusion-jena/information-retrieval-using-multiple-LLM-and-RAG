Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about which deep learning frameworks (such as TensorFlow or PyTorch) were used in the studies mentioned. The context focuses on the use of machine learning techniques for grassland management and conservation, but it does not specify the deep learning frameworks employed.

However, it is important to note that both TensorFlow and PyTorch are popular open-source frameworks for building deep learning models. These frameworks provide tools and libraries for designing, training, and implementing neural networks, which are widely used in various applications, including remote sensing and agroecosystem analysis.

In the context of the studies provided, the focus is on machine learning techniques for assessing aboveground biomass, nutritive characteristics, and floristic composition of grasslands. While these studies might have used deep learning methods, the specific frameworks are not mentioned.

To determine the deep learning frameworks used in these studies, one would need to consult the original research articles or contact the authors directly for additional information.
