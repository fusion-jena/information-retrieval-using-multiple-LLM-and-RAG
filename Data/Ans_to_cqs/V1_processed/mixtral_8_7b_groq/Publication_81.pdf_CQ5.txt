In summary, the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline for fish classification in this study consists of DNA barcode sequences of various fish species. The sequences are preprocessed and converted into numerical data using one-hot encoding before being fed into the ESK model, which combines EN-SAE and KDE techniques. The Elastic Net technique is used to improve the generalization ability of the model and prevent overfitting due to the limited size of the dataset.
