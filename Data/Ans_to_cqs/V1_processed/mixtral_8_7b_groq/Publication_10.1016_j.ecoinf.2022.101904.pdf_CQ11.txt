The provided context does not include information about the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the presentation of a new deep learning model called 3DUNetGSFormer, which aims to improve wetland mapping using generative adversarial networks and Swin transformer. The authors compare the performance of their model with other existing models, such as ViT, CoAtNet, CNN + ST, GAN + ST, and 3DUNetGSFormer. However, there is no mention of the data repository link or any information about where to access the dataset used in the study. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
