The provided context discusses various aspects of deep learning and camera trap studies, but it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of camera traps for monitoring small mammals and the development of machine learning models for image classification.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for computer vision tasks include:

1. Image-level classification: This is the simplest form of annotation where each image is assigned a label indicating the presence or absence of a particular object or class.
2. Bounding box annotation: In this technique, a bounding box is drawn around the object of interest in an image. This provides a rough localization of the object within the image.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with the class or object it belongs to. This provides a more precise localization of the object within the image compared to bounding box annotation.
4. Instance segmentation: This is a more advanced form of segmentation where each instance of an object is segmented and labeled separately, even if they overlap or are in close proximity.

In the context of camera trap studies, image-level classification is commonly used to identify the species present in an image. Bounding box annotation or instance segmentation can be used to localize and track individual animals within an image or video sequence.

For example, the R-package 'Machine Learning for Wildlife Image Classification (MLWIC2)' provides functions for classifying new camera trap images with provided models and for training new classification models using own images. This package can be used for image-level classification tasks.

More recently, machine learning has been implemented in annotation programs to allow for semi-automatic workflows which combine automatic classification and human labeling. AIDE (Annotation Interface for Data-driven Ecology) is an open-source web framework for image annotation that also provides tools for training machine learning models. This tool can potentially be used for more advanced annotation techniques such as semantic or instance segmentation.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for camera trap studies, it can be inferred that image-level classification is commonly used, and more advanced techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation can also be used depending on the specific research question and study design.
