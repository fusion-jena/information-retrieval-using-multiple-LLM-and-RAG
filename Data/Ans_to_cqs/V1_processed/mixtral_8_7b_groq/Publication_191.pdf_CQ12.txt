The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of convolutional layers, feature maps/channels, and filters. These are all concepts specific to CNNs. Additionally, the paper compares the performance of their proposed method to that of AlexNet, VGGNet, and GoogleNet, all of which are CNN architectures. There is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the given context. Therefore, it can be concluded with confidence that a CNN is the deep learning model used in this pipeline.
