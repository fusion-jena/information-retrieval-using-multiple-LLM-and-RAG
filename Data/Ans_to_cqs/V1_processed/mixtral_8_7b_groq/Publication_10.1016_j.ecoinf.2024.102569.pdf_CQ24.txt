In the context provided, there is no direct mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, there are some related discussions on handling heterogeneous observations and extreme values in ecological data that can provide insights into handling randomness in general.

In ecological informatics, the presence of heterogeneous observations or extreme values can significantly impact the accuracy of species distribution models. To address this issue, Liu et al. (2018) proposed using maximum entropy density estimation to detect outliers in species distribution data. This method involves estimating the probability density function of the data and identifying observations that deviate significantly from the expected distribution. By removing these outliers, the model can better capture the underlying patterns in the data.

Similarly, Louvrier et al. (2020) discussed the use of information geometry in statistical machine learning to develop mechanistic-statistical models for ecological processes. This approach involves modeling the data using a combination of statistical methods and domain-specific knowledge. By incorporating prior knowledge about the ecological processes, the model can better handle extreme values and other sources of randomness in the data.

In the context of deep learning, randomness can be introduced in various stages of the pipeline, such as data preprocessing, weight initialization, and dropout regularization. To handle randomness in these stages, several strategies can be employed:

1. Fixed seed value: To ensure reproducibility of the results, a fixed seed value can be set for the random number generator used in the deep learning pipeline. This ensures that the same sequence of random numbers is generated every time the pipeline is run, allowing for consistent results.
2. Data shuffling: When splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets, random shuffling of the data can help ensure that each set contains a representative sample of the data.
3. Weight initialization: Initializing the weights of the neural network with random values can help break symmetry and prevent all neurons from learning the same features. Different initialization methods, such as Xavier initialization and He initialization, can be used to control the distribution of the initial weights.
4. Dropout regularization: During training, dropout regularization can be used to randomly set a fraction of the neurons in each layer to zero. This helps prevent overfitting by encouraging the model to learn redundant features.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, there are related discussions on handling heterogeneous observations and extreme values in ecological data. In the context of deep learning, strategies such as fixed seed value, data shuffling, weight initialization, and dropout regularization can be employed to handle randomness in the pipeline.
