The provided context does not contain specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the study. However, it does mention that a 5 Ã— 10-fold cross-validation was performed, which is a technique used to assess the performance and generalization of a machine learning model. In the context of this study, it appears that the cross-validation was used to compare the performance of different classification methods, but it is not clear if it was also used to determine when training is complete.

In general, there are several common criteria used to determine when training is complete in machine learning models, including:

1. Validation loss plateau: This is the most common criterion used to determine when training is complete. It involves monitoring the performance of the model on a validation set during training and stopping the training process when the validation loss stops decreasing or starts increasing, indicating that the model is starting to overfit the training data.
2. Early stopping: This is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting by stopping the training process before it converges to a minimum. It involves monitoring the performance of the model on a validation set during training and stopping the training process when the validation loss starts increasing, even if the training loss is still decreasing.
3. Fixed number of iterations: In some cases, the training process is stopped after a fixed number of iterations or epochs, regardless of the performance of the model on the validation set. This is often used when there is a limited amount of training data or computational resources available.
4. Patience: This criterion involves setting a threshold for the number of epochs or iterations to wait before stopping the training process if the validation loss does not improve. This can be useful when working with noisy or unstable data.

Without more information about the specific training process used in the study, it is not possible to determine which of these criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
