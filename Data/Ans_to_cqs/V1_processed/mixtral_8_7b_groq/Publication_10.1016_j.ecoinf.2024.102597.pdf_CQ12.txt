Based on the provided context, there is no information about the use of deep learning models in the pipeline for estimating water quality parameters (WQP). Deep learning algorithms were considered, but due to the limited number of samples, they were not found to be suitable. Therefore, the focus of the study shifted towards ensemble learning methods such as Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), and XGBoost.

Moreover, the study compares the performance of these ensemble learning methods with CatBoost, another ensemble learning method, and finds that CatBoost has a weaker performance than RF and GBDT, but XGBoost demonstrates the highest robustness for estimating the water Chla concentration and turbidity in Nansi Lake.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that there is no deep learning model used in the pipeline for estimating WQP in this study.
