Based on the provided context, the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline in the given research are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the data used in the study is related to forest fires and takes the form of spatial inputs. These spatial inputs are represented as masks of states (M) with dimensions of 257 × 257 × 9. This format likely stores information about the states of each cell in a grid or matrix, possibly indicating the presence or absence of a forest fire in each cell.

The research focuses on developing a machine learning model that learns neighborhood relationships (Rk) using this spatial input data. The learning of these relationships allows for a better understanding of how different elements of the system interact. The study aims to improve the neighborhood relation Rk by implementing a more flexible and complete architecture capable of learning such relationships through experience and accumulated data.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention other data formats such as images, audio, or video, it is possible that the research team transformed or preprocessed these formats into the spatial input format (masks of states) for their deep learning pipeline. Commonly, deep learning models can handle various data formats, including images (usually in the form of multi-dimensional arrays), audio (time-series data or spectrograms), and video (sequences of images). In general, the choice of data format depends on the specific problem and the nature of the data available.

In summary, the given research primarily uses spatial input data in the form of masks of states (257 × 257 × 9) for their deep learning pipeline. However, the context does not explicitly mention other data formats such as images, audio, or video.
