The context provided does not give explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that remote sensing Earth observation data, specifically satellite imagery, is used as input for the deep learning model.

In the given context, a deep neural network was trained to classify different land cover forms based on their spectral signatures. This implies that the authors used spectral data, which is typically obtained through satellite or aerial sensors. The raster bands stack, serving as the input layer of the network, represents a stack of various rasters, such as spectral channels from satellite images. Each raster contains information about different wavelengths, forming a multidimensional tensor.

While the context does not specifically mention the data collection methods, it can be reasonably assumed that the authors utilized satellite imagery as the primary source of raw data. This assumption is based on the nature of the study, which focuses on land use and land cover (LULC) classification and dynamics. Remote sensing is a common method for collecting data in such studies, as it allows for the acquisition of large-scale, synoptic data over time.

In summary, although the context does not directly answer the query, it can be inferred that remote sensing data, particularly satellite imagery, is used as raw data in the deep learning pipeline for LULC classification.
