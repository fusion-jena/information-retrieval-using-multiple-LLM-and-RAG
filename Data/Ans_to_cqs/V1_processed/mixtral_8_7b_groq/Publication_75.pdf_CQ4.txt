Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the described deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the architecture of a deep learning model called SeedNet, which is used for seed image classification and retrieval. It explains the structure of SeedNet, including the use of convolutional layers, ReLU activation, and pooling layers for reducing parameters and controlling overfitting. The text also compares the performance of SeedNet with other CNNs and traditional methods. However, it does not provide information about data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
