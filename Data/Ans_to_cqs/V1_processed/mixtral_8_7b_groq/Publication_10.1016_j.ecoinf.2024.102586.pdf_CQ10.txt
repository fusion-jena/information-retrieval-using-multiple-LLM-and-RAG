I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository link on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The context consists of various research articles and papers related to ecological informatics, biodiversity loss, alien plant invasions, and phenology shifts due to warming temperatures. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested link.
