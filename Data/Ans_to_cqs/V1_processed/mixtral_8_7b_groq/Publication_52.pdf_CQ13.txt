Based on the provided context, the deep learning model in question is a Deep Extreme Learning Machine (Deep ELM), which is built upon the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) approach. The text does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the Deep ELM model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does highlight some key characteristics of ELMs and Deep ELMs that are relevant to the query.

ELMs are a type of Single-Hidden Layer Feed Forward Neural Network (SLFFNN) with randomly assigned input weights and biases in the hidden layer. The output weights are calculated using a simple matrix multiplication. This random initialization and algebraic output weight calculation methodology differ from traditional deep learning models, which often require careful tuning of hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the choice of optimizer.

Deep ELMs, which simulate the functioning of biological brain cells in a realistic manner, are an extension of ELMs to multiple layers. The text mentions the use of an Online Sequential Multi-layer algorithm and a Graph Regularized Extreme Learning Machine Autoencoder for the Deep ELM model. These techniques aim to optimize the choice of input layer weights and biases, enhancing the model's generalization capabilities.

In summary, the provided context does not offer explicit information about the hyperparameters used in the Deep ELM model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it is clear that Deep ELMs employ a distinct approach to learning, using random initialization and algebraic output weight calculation, in contrast to traditional deep learning models that rely on careful hyperparameter tuning.
