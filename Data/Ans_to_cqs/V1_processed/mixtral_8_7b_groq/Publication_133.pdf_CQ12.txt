Based on the context provided, the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a convolutional neural network (CNN). This is indicated by the mention of "deep neural networks (DNNs), and particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs)" in the second piece of context. No other type of deep learning model, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or Transformers, is mentioned in the context. Therefore, it can be concluded that a CNN is the type of deep learning model utilized in this study.
