The provided context discusses various techniques and concepts related to machine learning and transfer learning, but it does not explicitly mention the specific preprocessing techniques for addressing data bias during the deep learning pipeline as asked in the query. However, I can provide some general techniques that are commonly used for addressing data bias in machine learning, which can also be applied to deep learning.

1. Stratified sampling: Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that involves dividing the population into homogeneous subgroups (or strata) and then selecting samples from each stratum. This method ensures that each stratum is proportionally represented in the sample, which can help in reducing bias. Stratified sampling can be used during the data splitting process, where the data is split into training and testing sets.
2. Oversampling: Oversampling is a technique used to increase the representation of the minority class in the dataset. This can help in reducing bias by ensuring that the model is trained on a more balanced dataset. Oversampling can be done by duplicating instances of the minority class or by generating synthetic data using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Undersampling: Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the representation of the majority class in the dataset. This can help in reducing bias by ensuring that the model is not biased towards the majority class. Undersampling can be done by randomly selecting instances from the majority class or by using techniques such as Tomek links.
4. Diverse data collection: Collecting diverse data is an important step in reducing bias. This involves collecting data from various sources, including underrepresented groups, to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population. Diverse data collection can help in reducing bias by ensuring that the model is trained on a dataset that is representative of the population.

It is important to note that while these techniques can help in reducing bias, they may not completely eliminate it. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the model for bias and fairness using various evaluation metrics and techniques.
