The provided context discusses the use of the Direct Application Programming Interface (API) in Python to retrieve picture data for forest fire point information in a study area, which is then saved in CSV format on Google Drive. However, it does not explicitly mention whether surveys, sensors, or public datasets are used for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline.

Nonetheless, the context does imply the use of remote sensing technology, specifically high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite images, to gather data for land use and land cover (LULC) in the Panhandle area of Florida, USA. Remote sensing involves the use of sensors mounted on satellites or aircraft to measure various aspects of the Earth's surface, such as reflectance, temperature, and vegetation cover. Therefore, it can be inferred that sensors are used for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of machine learning techniques for classifying fire-damaged monuments and quantifying carbon emissions from forest fires with intricate influencing factors. These techniques typically require large amounts of labeled data for training and testing. While the context does not explicitly state where this data comes from, it is possible that a combination of public datasets and data collected through remote sensing are used for this purpose.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly answer the query, it can be inferred that sensors, specifically remote sensing technology, are used for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline. Additionally, it is possible that public datasets and data collected through remote sensing are used for training and testing machine learning models. However, further information is needed to confirm these inferences.
