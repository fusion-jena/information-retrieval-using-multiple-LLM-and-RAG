Based on the provided context, specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. The text only generally refers to "realistic augmentations of the original dataset" (Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019) but does not specify what these augmentations entail. Common data augmentation techniques for image data include flipping, rotating, and scaling. However, without explicit confirmation in the text, it is not certain these methods were used.
