Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline for bird or frog species identification. The context focuses on the use of machine learning and deep learning models for bird identification, particularly through the BirdNET app and eBird platform. It also mentions the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying bird and frog species in soundscape recordings. However, it does not detail the specific data annotation techniques utilized.

In general, data annotation techniques for deep learning can include:

1. Bounding box annotation: Drawing bounding boxes around objects of interest in images.
2. Instance segmentation: Labeling each pixel of an object in an image, allowing for precise object localization and segmentation.
3. Semantic segmentation: Labeling pixels based on object categories, without distinguishing individual instances.
4. Point annotation: Labeling specific points of interest in images, such as key points for object detection or landmarks for facial recognition.

The choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific problem and the desired output. For bird or frog species identification, instance segmentation or bounding box annotation could be used to localize and segment individual species in images. However, the provided context does not specify which technique is used.
