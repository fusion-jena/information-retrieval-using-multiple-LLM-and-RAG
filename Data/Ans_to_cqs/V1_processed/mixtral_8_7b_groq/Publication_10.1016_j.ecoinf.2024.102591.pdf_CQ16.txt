Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the FIREMAP algorithm. However, it is mentioned that wildfire events from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) were used to acquire training samples and validate the FIREMAP burned area (BA) product. Additionally, the number of field plots established within each ecosystem and land cover type was provided for wildfire events used to validate the vegetation recovery product in FIREMAP.

In general, training of machine learning models, including those used in remote sensing and image processing, is considered complete when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly. This indicates that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data and is unlikely to improve further by seeing more training examples.

In the context of FIREMAP, it is possible that the training of the algorithm was completed when the validation loss for the burned area or vegetation recovery product stopped decreasing significantly. However, without specific information about the training procedure and evaluation metrics used in FIREMAP, this is only a hypothesis.

Therefore,
