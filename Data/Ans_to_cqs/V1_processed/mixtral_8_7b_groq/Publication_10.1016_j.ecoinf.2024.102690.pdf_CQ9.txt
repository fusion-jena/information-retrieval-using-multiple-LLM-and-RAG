Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The text does not mention any data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF in relation to the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.

However, the context does provide information about some of the data sources used in the study. These include the CRU dataset, Grain price data, GlobeLand30, ALOS World 3D-30 m, China soil map based harmonized world soil database (HWSD) (v1.1), and MODIS image MOD13Q1. The CRU dataset is available on the website <https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/>, and the Grain price data is obtained from the Guangzhou statistical yearbook and national grain trading center. The GlobeLand30 and ALOS World 3D-30 m datasets are provided by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and the China soil map based harmonized world soil database (HWSD) (v1.1) is available on the website <http://webarchive.iiasa.ac.at/Research/LUC/External-World-soil-database/HTML/>. The MODIS image MOD13Q1 is provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

Therefore, while there is no information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline, some of the data sources used in the study are available on public websites.
