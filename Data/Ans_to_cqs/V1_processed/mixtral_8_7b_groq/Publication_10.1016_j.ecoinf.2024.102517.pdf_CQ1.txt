The context does not provide specific information about how the raw data, in this case, bird sounds, were collected for the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data was collected in the field, as traditional noise reduction methods were used to create a clean bird sound test set from a dataset that contained 1568 clean bird sound segments. Field recordings often consist of significant amounts of non-smooth noise, which can make traditional bio-acoustic noise reduction methods partially ineffective.

It can also be inferred that the data was not collected from public datasets, as the context states that the current scarcity of labeled clean bioacoustic recordings makes it challenging to train deep learning-based models for bioacoustic noise reduction.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the raw data for this deep learning pipeline was collected through field recordings, possibly using sensors or microphones to capture the bird sounds. However, the specific methods used for data collection are not provided in the context.
