The provided pieces of context do not contain specific information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. However, they do mention some studies that use deep learning approaches, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), for time series forecasting.

In the study by Dehghani et al. (2023), they compare the performance of LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM for hourly short-term streamflow forecasting using deep learning approaches. Although they do not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in their models, they do mention that they used the Adam optimizer and a learning rate of 0.001.

Feng et al. (2017) proposed a data-driven multi-model methodology with deep feature selection for short-term wind forecasting. They used a deep learning model based on a stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) and a backpropagation neural network (BPNN). However, they do not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in their models.

Furthermore, the context also mentions some studies that use Genetic Programming (GP) as a feature selection method for model input variables. For instance, Althoey et al. (2023) and Hu (2023) used GP for feature selection and modeling tasks. However, GP is not a deep learning approach, and the hyperparameters mentioned in these studies are related to GP, such as population size and number of generations.

Therefore, while some studies using deep learning approaches are mentioned in the provided context, they do not provide sufficient information on the hyperparameters used in their models.


The provided pieces of context do not contain specific information about the hyperparameters used in deep learning models for solving civil engineering problems. However, some studies mentioned in the context use deep learning approaches such as LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM for time series forecasting and mention the use of the Adam optimizer and a learning rate of 0.001. Other studies use Genetic Programming (GP) for feature selection and modeling tasks, but they do not provide information on the hyperparameters used in deep learning models.
