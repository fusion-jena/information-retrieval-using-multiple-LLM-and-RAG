The context provided does not give specific details about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model developed by Paumen et al., 2021. However, it does mention that the study includes all observations in statistical modeling, which can contribute to the model's generalizability.

Including all observations in the model, rather than excluding some, can help reduce bias and make the model more representative of the population. This approach is generally recommended in machine learning and statistical modeling to increase the model's ability to perform well on unseen data.

Furthermore, the authors mention poor performance of software attempting automated bat ID, which could be due to a lack of generalizability in those models. By implementing Bayesian algorithms and allowing users to interact with the software, the authors aim to significantly improve the performance of their model. This approach could also contribute to the model's generalizability, as user interaction and Bayesian algorithms can help the model learn from a wider range of data and make more accurate predictions on new data.

In addition, the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the model can also contribute to its generalizability. CNNs are a type of deep learning algorithm that are well-suited for image and signal processing tasks, such as analyzing bat calls. They have been shown to be highly effective in tasks that require identifying patterns in large and diverse datasets, which can help improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Overall, while the context does not provide specific details about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it does suggest that the authors took a comprehensive approach to modeling, including all observations and using a powerful deep learning algorithm, which can contribute to the model's ability to generalize to new data.
