The provided context does not include specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe a deep learning pipeline for underwater image analysis to classify healthy and bleached corals.

The pipeline involves taking an image using an underwater drone, preprocessing the image, and then extracting features using handcrafted descriptors and pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (D-CNNs). Specifically, the context mentions using AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, GoogleNet, and Inceptionv3 as pre-trained D-CNNs.

The extracted features are then used to create a visual vocabulary (VV), which is essentially a set of features extracted from the features. The visual vocabulary is then passed to a classifier, such as SVM, to classify whether the VV-features are of bleached coral or healthy coral.

Therefore, while the context does not provide information on data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, it does describe a deep learning pipeline for underwater image analysis using pre-trained D-CNNs for feature extraction.
