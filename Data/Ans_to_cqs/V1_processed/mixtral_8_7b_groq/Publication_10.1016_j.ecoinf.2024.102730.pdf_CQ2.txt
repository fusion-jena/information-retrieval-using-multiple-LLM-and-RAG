Deep learning models can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific problem and the type of data available.

In computer vision tasks, deep learning models often use image data. Zeiler and Fergus (2014) used image data to visualize and understand convolutional networks. Barré et al. (2017) developed LeafNet, a computer vision system for automatic plant species identification using images. Wäldchen and Mader (2018) discussed machine learning for image-based species identification. Collins et al. (2023) used hybrid deep learning for plant species identification by processing image data.

Deep learning models can also work with time-series data, such as MODIS data, which is commonly used for vegetation monitoring. Zhang et al. (2003) monitored vegetation phenology using MODIS data, while Zhang et al. (2016) applied synthetic NDVI time series blended from Landsat and MODIS data for grassland biomass estimation. Beck and Goetz (2011) observed high northern latitude vegetation productivity changes between 1982 and 2008 using satellite observations, including MODIS data. Beck et al. (2006) improved monitoring of vegetation dynamics at very high latitudes using a new method with MODIS NDVI.

Audio data is another format used in deep learning pipelines. For instance, deep learning models can be applied to audio data for wildlife recognition. Clapham et al. (2020) developed an automated facial recognition system for wildlife that lack unique markings, using a deep learning approach for brown bears.

Video data can also be used in deep learning pipelines. Zmarz et al. (2019) used deep learning for chimpanzee face recognition from videos in the wild.

Lastly, deep learning models can handle structured data, such as CSV files. Ingrisch et al. (2022b) studied long-term warming effects on microbial biomass and recent plant-derived C in microbes of a subarctic grassland using CSV data.

In summary, deep learning models can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific problem and the type of data available.
