Based on the provided context, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. The text discusses the use of big-data in the context of valve gaping in organisms, along with temperature and chlorophyll data. However, it does not specify that these datasets are used in a deep learning pipeline, nor does it compare them to standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
