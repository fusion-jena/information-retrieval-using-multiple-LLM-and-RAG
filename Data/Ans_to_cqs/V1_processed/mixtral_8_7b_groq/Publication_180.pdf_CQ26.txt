The provided context discusses the use of TensorFlow, a deep learning platform, for automated Chagas disease vector identification. However, it does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer based on the given context.

However, I can provide some general techniques that are commonly used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline:

1. Stratified splitting: In stratified sampling, the data is divided into subgroups or strata based on some criterion, and then a sample is taken from each stratum. This ensures that the sample is representative of the entire population with respect to the stratification variable.
2. Oversampling: In oversampling, the minority class is sampled multiple times to increase its representation in the dataset. This can help reduce bias in the model towards the majority class.
3. Undersampling: In undersampling, the majority class is sampled less frequently to reduce its representation in the dataset. This can help reduce bias in the model towards the majority class.
4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from a diverse range of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population can help reduce bias in the model.

These techniques can help ensure that the deep learning model is trained on a dataset that is representative of the population and reduce bias in the model. However, the specific technique used depends on the dataset and the problem at hand. It is important to carefully consider the dataset and the problem before choosing a technique to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
