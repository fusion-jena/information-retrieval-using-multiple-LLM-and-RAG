The provided context does not give specific information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in the 3DUNetGSFormer model. GANs are known to incorporate randomness through the use of a random noise vector in the generator network. This random noise vector is used to generate synthetic samples, which can help alleviate the problem of imbalanced data in wetland mapping.

In the context of the 3D GAN model, a conditional map unit is employed to produce synthetic samples from a random noise vector for classes with a low number of training samples. This approach generates Î³i, the benefit of which is eliminating the problem of imbalanced data.

While the context does not explicitly mention strategies like setting a random seed value, it is important to note that handling randomness is a common practice in deep learning to ensure reproducibility and stability of results. Techniques to manage randomness include fixing random seed values for various processes like weight initialization, data shuffling, and dropout regularization. These strategies help in controlling the randomness introduced during the training process and ensure consistent performance across multiple runs.

In summary, the provided context focuses on the use of GANs for synthetic sample generation and the elimination of imbalanced data in wetland mapping. Although it does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness like setting a random seed value, these practices are generally adopted in deep learning to ensure reproducibility and stability of results.
