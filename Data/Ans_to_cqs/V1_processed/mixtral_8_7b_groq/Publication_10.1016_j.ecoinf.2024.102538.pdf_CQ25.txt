The purpose of the deep learning model described in the given context is bird sound identification or classification. The model aims to learn the model parameters, namely θ = {θa, θb, θc}, through end-to-end training, enabling it to identify different bird sounds accurately.

The model employs a hierarchical multilevel embedding framework to capture feature information at different levels, addressing the limitation of most existing methods that overlook inherent relationships among bird populations, resulting in the loss of biological information. This hierarchical structure helps the model discern subtle differences in birdcalls within the same branch based on the phylogenetic "tree."

Additionally, the model uses attention mechanisms to extract and select common and distinguishing features, further improving classification accuracy. A path correction strategy is also proposed to rectify inconsistent predictions.

The model's activation positions tend to be more dispersed and in the long-range in the order and family branches, while activation positions in the genus and species branches exhibit a higher degree of concentration and similarities. This observation indicates that the model can accurately identify bird vocalizations despite occasional detection of background noise.

In summary, the deep learning model discussed in the provided context is designed for bird sound classification, incorporating hierarchical multilevel labels for each bird and employing attention mechanisms to improve classification accuracy.
