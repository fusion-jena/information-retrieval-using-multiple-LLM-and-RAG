The study describes the process of ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model through the use of a diverse dataset and a specific splitting method.

Firstly, the dataset used in this study consists of satellite data from the SPOT6 satellite, which covers five study areas with various environments such as urban, mining, mountainous, and forest environments. These areas contain all the classes for the two nomenclatures, including five land cover (LC) classes and twelve land use (LU) classes. This diverse dataset ensures that the model is exposed to a wide range of variations and patterns in the data, which can help improve its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Secondly, the data was split into three mutually exclusive parts: a learning set, a validation set, and a test set. Four of the five areas were used for learning and validation, while the last isolated scene was used as the test set. This splitting method ensures that the model is trained and validated on data that is similar to the training data, but still distinct from it. By using a separate test set that contains all the classes and environments, the study evaluates the model's ability to generalize to new data that it has not seen during training.

However, the study does not explicitly mention the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are other common techniques used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models. Cross-validation involves splitting the data into multiple folds, training the model on one fold, and validating it on another fold. This process is repeated for all the folds, which can help reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize. Stratified splitting involves splitting the data in a way that ensures that each fold contains a representative sample of the classes in the data. This can help ensure that the model is trained and validated on data that contains a balanced distribution of the classes.

In summary, the study ensures the generalizability of the deep learning model by using a diverse dataset and a specific splitting method. However, the study does not explicitly mention the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are other common techniques used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models.
