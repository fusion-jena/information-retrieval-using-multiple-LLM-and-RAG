Based on the provided context, there is no information about the deployment of a trained deep learning model for SPAD value prediction. The text focuses on the comparison of different models for SPAD value prediction using a dataset of 89 records, which were divided into a training dataset (60 records) and a testing dataset (29 records). Three models were used for comparison: a simple linear model (LM), a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution (GLM), and an artificial neural network (ANN).

The LM and GLM models were fitted using the training dataset, and their performance was evaluated using the testing dataset. The LM model achieved an R-squared value of 0.81 on the training data and a mean absolute difference of 1.85 on the testing data. The GLM model performed slightly better than LM, with an R-squared value of 0.81 on the training data and a mean absolute deviance of 1.79 on the testing data.

An ANN model was also implemented for SPAD value prediction using the same predictors as in the LM and GLM models. The ANN model was constructed empirically, with the first layer containing two input nodes (one per each of the two parameters that were found to be the most suitable by LM and GLM) and the last layer containing only one node (predicted SPAD value). The model residuals obtained in each run were analyzed for a more reliable evaluation of the model performance. However, there is no information about the deployment of the trained ANN model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
