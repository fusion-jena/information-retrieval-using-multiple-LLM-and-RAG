The raw data in the deep learning pipeline for insect classification is collected through high-throughput biodiversity surveys. These surveys involve bulk-sampling of communities of Coleoptera (beetles) collected from different sites around the world. The specific families of insects chosen for downstream analysis include Brentidae, Carabidae, Chrysomelidae, Cryptophagidae, Curculionidae, Latridiidae, Leiodidae, Melyridae, Ptiliidae, Staphylinidae (excluding Scaphidiinae), Staphylinidae, and Tenebrionidae. A subset of single specimens is then taken from these bulk samples and individually photographed using a conventional stereoscope, NIKON SMZ1270i, equipped with a NIKON DS-Fi3 Microscope Camera. These images are denoted as the Local Low Quality (LL) dataset. The images in this dataset are intended to represent a more realistic scenario for machine-based classification. Therefore, the collection of raw data in this deep learning pipeline involves high-throughput biodiversity surveys and the subsequent photographing of individual specimens.
