The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the models were fine-tuned on a birdsong dataset. The characteristics of the calls in the birdsong dataset were studied to create fixed input segments for the CNNs. The CNNs were pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which is a large-scale image recognition dataset, often used as a starting point for transfer learning in computer vision tasks. The models were tested on various bioacoustic datasets, but the specific names of these datasets are not provided. Therefore, based on the given context, we can only confirm that a birdsong dataset and the ImageNet dataset were used in the deep learning pipeline.
