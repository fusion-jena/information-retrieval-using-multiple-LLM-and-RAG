Based on the provided context, there are no specific details about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the Random Forest classifier in the level-wise training, validation, and testing strategies. Commonly, in machine learning models, training can be considered complete when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly, or when the model starts to overfit. However, in the given context, the focus is on the distribution of trained, tested, and validated samples across the groups and the performance of the Random Forest classifier. The classifier's performance is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, but there is no mention of the training completion criteria. Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used in this case.
