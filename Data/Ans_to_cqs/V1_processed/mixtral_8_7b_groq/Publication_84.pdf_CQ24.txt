Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it is well-known that deep learning models, like other machine learning algorithms, can have variability in their results due to randomness in the training process. This randomness can come from various sources, including the initialization of model weights, the order of training examples, and the selection of mini-batches for stochastic gradient descent.

To handle this randomness and ensure the reproducibility of deep learning models, researchers and practitioners often employ several strategies:

1. Fixed seed value: By setting a fixed seed value, the random number generator used in the deep learning library will produce the same sequence of random numbers. This ensures that the model initialization, data shuffling, and other random processes are identical across multiple runs, making the results more reproducible.

2. Model averaging: Training multiple models with different random seeds and then averaging their predictions can help reduce the variance and improve the generalization of the model. This technique, known as ensemble learning, can lead to more stable and accurate results.

3. Cross-validation: Using cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, can help assess the performance of deep learning models while reducing the impact of randomness. By dividing the dataset into multiple folds and training the model on each fold, one can obtain a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

4. Deterministic algorithms: Some deep learning libraries provide options to use deterministic algorithms for specific operations, such as data shuffling or weight initialization. This can further reduce the randomness in the training process.

Although the provided context does not explicitly mention these strategies, they are commonly used in deep learning to handle randomness and improve model reproducibility and performance.
