Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline involves the use of vegetation survey data, peat depth data, topographic data, and other geospatial vector datasets. However, the context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in this pipeline.

From the context, we can infer that the following data types are used:

1. Vector datasets: These are likely to be in Esri Shapefile format (.shp), GeoJSON (.geojson), or other vector data formats. Examples include the peat depth map, Phase-1 habitat map, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Saltmarsh layer, Mean High Water Spring Tides, National Forest Inventory Data, and others.

2. Raster datasets: Although not explicitly mentioned, raster datasets are likely to be used, considering the topographic data and the use of LIDAR for deriving DEM. Raster datasets are typically in formats like GeoTIFF (.tif), ENVI (.envi), or others.

3. Other GIS data: The context refers to the use of EarthTrack mobile application, Living Wales data products, and other geospatial data sources, which are likely to be in various GIS formats.

There is no direct reference to image, audio, or video data formats in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline in this context primarily uses vector and raster geospatial data formats.
