Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about which deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used in the studies. However, the context does mention the potential of using deep learning for analyzing acoustic data in the future.

In the first piece of context, D. Luna-Naranjo et al. discuss the Acoustic Complexity Index (ACI) and its application in analyzing various ecological tasks. While they do not mention deep learning frameworks, they do reference a study by Purwins et al. (2019) that highlights the importance of reducing device bias in audio recordings for broader comparative analyses, potentially extending their use to fields like machine learning and deep learning.

The second piece of context includes a list of references, one of which is a paper by Purwins et al. (2019) that focuses on the comparison of audio recording systems for detecting and monitoring songbirds. They discuss the need for consistent feature spaces across studies for machine learning and deep learning applications. However, they do not mention any specific deep learning frameworks.

In summary, while the context suggests the potential for using deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch in analyzing acoustic data, there is no explicit information provided about which frameworks were used in the studies.
