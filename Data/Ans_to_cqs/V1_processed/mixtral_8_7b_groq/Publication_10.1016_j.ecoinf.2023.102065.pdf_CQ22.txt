The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the metrics of precision, recall, and accuracy. These metrics are used to assess the model's ability to correctly identify bird species in soundscape data.

Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions (correctly identified bird species) to the total positive predictions (all predictions of a particular bird species). It measures the model's ability to avoid false positives. In the context provided, the average total precision of the CNN-XC models is 81.2% at probability thresholds ranging from 0.65 to 0.99.

Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual occurrences of a bird species in the soundscape data. It measures the model's ability to avoid false negatives. The CNN-XC models had a total recall of over 20% at all probability thresholds, and at the 0.99 threshold, the average total precision was 77.1% and the average total recall was 28.2%.

Accuracy is the ratio of the total number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions made by the model. It measures the overall performance of the model. However, accuracy may not be the best metric for imbalanced datasets, where one class may have significantly more instances than another.

The models were also evaluated using total precision-recall curves, which provide a visual representation of the model's performance at different probability thresholds. These curves were plotted for each CNN model architecture over a range of probability thresholds (0.65 to 0.99) for XC pre-trained and not pre-trained CNNs, assessed using ROI test and soundscape data across all species.

In addition, the models were compared to BirdNET, a well-developed standard for bird species identification. BirdNET had a total precision of up to 81.8% at a probability threshold of 0.65, while the CNN-XC models had a maximum total precision of 81.2% at the same threshold. However, the CNN-XC models had higher recall than both versions of BirdNET, regardless of probability thresholds.

Overall, the CNN-XC models performed well in identifying bird species in soundscape data, as demonstrated by their high precision and recall values. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's ability to correctly identify bird species and avoid false positives and negatives.
