Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, the context does provide information about the metrics used to compare the retrieval performances of different networks, which include Average Retrieval Precision (ARP), Average Retrieval Rate (ARR), Fscore, and mean Average Precision (mAP).

Additionally, the context describes a preprocessing step of removing the MFM (Machine-readable Font Mark) from all pictures in the dataset. This step is taken to characterize all the pictures, typically positioned in one of the corners, and produce a single image per seed to create a new dataset of cropped images, each containing a single seed.

Therefore, while there is no explicit information about postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix, the context does provide information about preprocessing steps and the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the networks.
