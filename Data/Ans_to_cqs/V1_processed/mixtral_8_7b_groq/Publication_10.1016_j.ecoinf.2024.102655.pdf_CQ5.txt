The provided context does not discuss specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Instead, it focuses on the importance of analyzing historical trends in water quality datasets to select the most variable and representative scenarios for training machine learning models.

In the context, it is mentioned that an ideal dataset for machine learning models would include a wide range of data representing all possible states of the modeled system. However, environmental processes can produce repetitive datasets that are inadequate for model training. Water quality datasets, in particular, are composed of a large number of parameters that often represent redundant information. Despite these known issues, detailed analysis of historical variation in a dataset is rarely employed for selecting training data subsets prior to developing predictive models.

Therefore, analyzing historical trends in water quality datasets is necessary to find the most variable and representative scenarios useful for machine learning model training. This process can improve the training step and lead to improved predictive outputs.

In summary, while the provided context does not discuss specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines, it emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate and representative datasets for machine learning model training, particularly in the context of water quality analysis.
