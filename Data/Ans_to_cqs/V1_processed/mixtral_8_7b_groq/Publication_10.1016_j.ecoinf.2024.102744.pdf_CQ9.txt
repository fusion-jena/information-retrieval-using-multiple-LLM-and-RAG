The provided context does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It does mention that the VnPollenBee dataset was used in the experiments, but it does not specify where this dataset can be found or accessed. Common platforms for sharing and archiving datasets include Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF, but the text does not indicate that the data was shared on any of these platforms. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
