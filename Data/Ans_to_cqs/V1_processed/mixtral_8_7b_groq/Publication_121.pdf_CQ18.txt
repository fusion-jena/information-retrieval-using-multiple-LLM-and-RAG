The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of training and validation accuracy metrics. Specifically, the training and validation accuracy of the MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based transfer learned models, as well as the fine-tuned models, were measured and plotted in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. These figures provide a visual representation of how well the models are learning and generalizing to new data during the training process.

Moreover, the training and validation accuracy of the models were monitored within 10 and 100 epochs (iterations), which allowed for the identification of any potential overfitting or underfitting issues. Additionally, the use of a dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.2 further helped to reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Furthermore, the models were fine-tuned and re-evaluated using the same dataset and training parameters, which enabled a fair comparison of their performance. The models were saved in the machine with all the class labels, indicating that the model performance was being tracked and recorded throughout the training process.

Overall, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involved the use of training and validation accuracy metrics, visual representations of the models' learning and generalization abilities, and measures to prevent overfitting. These strategies allowed for the identification of any potential issues and ensured that the models were performing well throughout the training process.
