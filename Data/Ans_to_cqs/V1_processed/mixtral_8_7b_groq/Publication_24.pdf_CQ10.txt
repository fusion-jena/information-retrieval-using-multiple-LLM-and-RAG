Unfortunately, there is no specific link provided in the given context to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The authors mentioned that they used Python v.2.7.12, Theano v.0.9.0, Lasagne v.0.2, and librosa v.0.4.2 for developing the pipeline. However, they did not provide any information about where the code is hosted or if it is publicly available. Therefore, I cannot give you a definitive answer to your query.
