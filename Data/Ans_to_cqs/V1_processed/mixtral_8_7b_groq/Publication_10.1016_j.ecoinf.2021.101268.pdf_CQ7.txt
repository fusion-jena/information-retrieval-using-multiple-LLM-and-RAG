The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training typically include a training set, a validation set, and a test set. These sets are used to evaluate the performance of the model during and after the training process.

The training set is used to train the model by adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the error on the training data. The validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model and to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. The validation set helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to new data.

The test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. The test set is independent of the training and validation sets and provides an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on new data.

In the provided context, the deep learning models are trained and evaluated on three different sets: raw data, pre-processed data, and swapped testing sets. The raw data refers to the original data without any pre-processing, while the pre-processed data refers to the data that has undergone some form of pre-processing, such as normalization or augmentation. The swapped testing sets refer to the test sets that are swapped between the raw and pre-processed data.

The accuracy of the models is reported for each of these sets. For example, the VGG-19 model achieves a training accuracy of 96.94% on the pre-processed data and a validation accuracy of 97.92%. The test accuracy of the model on the raw data is 95.15%, while on the pre-processed data, it is 96.52%.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of confusion matrices and SmoothGrad methods to evaluate the models' performance further. Confusion matrices provide a visual representation of the model's performance by showing the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class. SmoothGrad is a method that visualizes the input space relevance of the model by plotting a point cloud where the density denotes the relevance.

In summary, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training include a training set, a validation set, and a test set. These sets are used to evaluate the model's performance during and after the training process. The provided context shows the accuracy of deep learning models trained on raw and pre-processed data, as well as swapped testing sets. Additionally, confusion matrices and SmoothGrad methods are used to further evaluate the models' performance.
