The provided context discusses the training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for taxonomic identification, but it does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention some techniques that can be considered as part of the preprocessing phase.

Before training the CNN model, the authors used a two-stage process for training the network. In the first stage, only the top classifier (a fully connected layer) was trained based on features extracted from processing images with a pretrained convolutional part of the network. This suggests that the images were likely preprocessed in some way before being used as input to the convolutional part of the network.

One preprocessing technique mentioned in the context is data augmentation. The authors applied data augmentation by randomly deforming input images in each training cycle. This technique helps increase the size and variability of the training set, which can improve the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

Another technique mentioned is transfer learning, where the authors used a pretrained ResNet-50 network architecture. Transfer learning is a technique where a pretrained model is used as a starting point for a new task, which can save time and resources by leveraging the knowledge learned from a large dataset.

The context also mentions the use of dropout techniques to enhance model robustness. Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize to new data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps such as normalization or scaling, it does mention data augmentation, transfer learning, and dropout techniques that can be considered part of the preprocessing phase. These techniques help improve the model's performance, prevent overfitting, and enhance model robustness.
