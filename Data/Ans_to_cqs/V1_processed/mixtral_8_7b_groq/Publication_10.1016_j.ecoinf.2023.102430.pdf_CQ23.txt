In summary, the generalizability of the deep learning model was addressed by splitting the dataset into training and testing sets and repeating the training-testing process multiple times. However, the use of cross-validation and stratified splitting, which could have additional positive impacts on the model's generalizability, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
