Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, we can infer some details about the data analysis and model comparison processes from the "3. Results" section.

After training the models, the authors analyzed 37 FIT runs per species and compared 185 model outputs in the first experiment. They also applied the same approach to real missing data points in a second experiment with 13 FIT runs. The results focus on the effects of deleting missing values and using mean imputation on estimating the true population size.

The authors used various methods for data preprocessing and comparison, including:

1. Control Group: In the first experiment, the control group consisted of unmodified datasets for each species. In the second experiment, the control group was the geometric profile extracted by an experienced operator.
2. Delete Case: This method involved removing all data rows containing missing values.
3. Mean Imputation: In this method, missing values were replaced with the mean of the available values in the dataset.

The context also mentions the use of the FIT method, which is a footprint identification technique. The authors used the FIT method to analyze footprints of Amur tigers, cheetahs, giant pandas, and mountain lions.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, it does discuss data analysis and model comparison methods such as using control groups, deleting cases, and mean imputation.
