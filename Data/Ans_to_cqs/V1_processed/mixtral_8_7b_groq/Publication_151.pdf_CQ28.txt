The text does not provide information about which cloud platform, if any, was used to deploy the deep learning model. It mentions that the model was implemented using PyTorch and trained on 2080Ti NVIDIA GPUs, but it does not specify whether these GPUs were part of a local machine or a cloud-based virtual machine. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
