The provided context does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some data preprocessing techniques used in a specific study related to Lake Urmia.

In the study, the authors used the Climate Prediction Center (CMAP) global monthly precipitation dataset, which is a collection of precipitation datasets produced by analyzing gauge data and estimating satellite-based precipitation. The CMAP data was downloaded from the NOAA repository. Additionally, Landsat satellite datasets were used to investigate water surface area and salinity variations over a long period of time (i.e. 1985 to 2020). To minimize the radiometric effects, radiometric calibration was done for the selected images.

Regarding the query, techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria, and then randomly splitting each subgroup to ensure a balanced representation in the training, validation, and test sets.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class in the dataset to balance it with the majority class.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class in the dataset to balance it with the minority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population.

These techniques can help to mitigate issues such as class imbalance, which can negatively impact the performance of deep learning models.
