Based on the provided context, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the machine learning model are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the training process involved a grid search approach to optimize the model's hyperparameters. This method exhaustively tested all possible combinations of defined parameter values and evaluated the model's performance using cross-validation techniques and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric.

The winning parameters were then selected based on the performance of the model with those specific settings. This process of selecting the best combination of hyperparameters can be seen as a way to ensure the model has been trained sufficiently, as it aims to minimize the RMSE and enhance the model's ability to generalize well to new, unseen data.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, it can be inferred that the grid search approach, cross-validation techniques, and RMSE metric were used to ensure the model's performance was optimized and ready for making accurate predictions on new data.
