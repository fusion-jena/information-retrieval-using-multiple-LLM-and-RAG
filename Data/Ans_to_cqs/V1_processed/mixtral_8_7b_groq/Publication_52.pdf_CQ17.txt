The provided context discusses various deep learning algorithms and regularization techniques, including the innovative DELE algorithm used in the MIGRATE_ELM for native and invasive species classification, and the Geo Location Country Based Service approach. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization in the deep learning pipeline.

Deep Extreme Learning Machine (DELM) methods, such as Regularized Extreme Learning Machines (RELM), have been developed to improve object, speech, and audio recognition. These methods have been successful in learning from large datasets and preventing overfitting. However, the context does not specify whether dropout or L2 regularization is used in RELM.

The Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a single-hidden layer feedforward neural network with randomly assigned input weights and biases. ELMs have been proven to generalize well and require minimal training time, making them suitable for big data analysis. However, the context does not mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization in ELMs.

In summary, the provided context discusses various regularization techniques and deep learning algorithms, but it does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization in the deep learning pipeline.
