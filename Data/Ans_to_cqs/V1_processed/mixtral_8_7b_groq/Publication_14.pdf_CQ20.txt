The text does not provide explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that some parts of the process were carried out using Google Cloud, which offers a variety of hardware options including CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.

The feature extraction of the fixed inception layers was completed in 1 hour and 26 minutes on 15 CPUs. This suggests that CPUs were used for this part of the process. The training of the new layers was completed in 27 minutes on a single CPU, which again suggests that CPUs were used.

However, the text also mentions that to reduce training time, the feature vectors for the frozen layers were extracted in parallel using Google Cloud DataFlow. Google Cloud DataFlow is a fully-managed service for transforming and enriching data in stream (real time) and batch (historical) modes. It can run on Google's infrastructure, which includes CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. Therefore, it is possible that GPUs or TPUs were used for the feature extraction of the frozen layers.

In addition, the author mentions thanks to many Google engineers who shared code samples and answered questions on deploying machine learning models. Google provides tools and services for deploying machine learning models on various hardware resources, including CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. Therefore, it is possible that GPUs or TPUs were used for training the fine-tuned neural network.

In conclusion, while the text does not provide explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, it does suggest that CPUs were used for some parts of the process, and GPUs or TPUs may have been used for other parts of the process.
