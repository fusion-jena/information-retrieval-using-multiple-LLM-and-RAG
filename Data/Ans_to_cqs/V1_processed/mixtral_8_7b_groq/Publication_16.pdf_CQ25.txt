The purpose of the deep learning model in the study is bird classification using visual data. The model is designed to analyze and classify different bird species based on visual data. This is achieved by using a combination of both vision and acoustic-based data, which enables the platform to extend its reach into habitats where visual monitoring is not feasible. The study aims to provide a more holistic overview of the habitat by studying both image and acoustic data.

The deep learning model used in the study is a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) configured with a filter size of 2, using Backpropagation as the learning algorithm and Adam as the optimizer. The model is designed to improve generalization and reduce overfitting by using a dropout value of 50% in the first three layers, which are composed of 256 nodes each. The final layer of the model is equal to the number of classes in the dataset.

The performance of the trained model is measured using Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, and Accuracy. Sensitivity describes the true positive rate, while Specificity describes the true negative rate. Precision is used to show the number of correctly classified species.

The study aims to expand the number of classes in the model by including additional data in future work. This will enable the comparison of the approach outlined in the paper with more advanced network architectures such as 1D CNNs.

In summary, the deep learning model in the study is designed for bird classification using visual data. The model is trained using an MLP with Backpropagation and Adam optimizer, and its performance is measured using Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, and Accuracy. The study aims to expand the number of classes in the model and compare it with more advanced network architectures in future work.
