Deep learning models often employ various strategies to handle randomness in the pipeline, such as the random seed value. While the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, it does mention the use of domain randomization in the context of simulating deep neural networks for real-world applications.

Domain randomization is a technique used to improve the robustness of deep learning models by exposing them to a wide range of variations during training. This technique involves randomizing various aspects of the training data, such as textures, lighting conditions, and object poses, to encourage the model to learn more generalized features. While not explicitly stated, the use of randomization in domain randomization suggests that deep learning pipelines can handle randomness in some form.

In addition, the context also mentions the use of different data modalities, such as RGB, HSI, RGB-D, RGB-NIR, and multimodal data, for various applications. The use of different data modalities can introduce variability into the training data, which can help the model handle randomness and improve its generalization ability.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of unsupervised domain adaptation techniques in object detection. Unsupervised domain adaptation involves transferring a model trained on one dataset to another dataset without labeled data. This technique can help handle the randomness of the target dataset by aligning the feature distributions of the source and target datasets.

While the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, it suggests that deep learning pipelines can handle randomness through techniques such as domain randomization, the use of different data modalities, and unsupervised domain adaptation. These techniques can help improve the robustness and generalization ability of deep learning models, enabling them to handle real-world variations and uncertainties.
