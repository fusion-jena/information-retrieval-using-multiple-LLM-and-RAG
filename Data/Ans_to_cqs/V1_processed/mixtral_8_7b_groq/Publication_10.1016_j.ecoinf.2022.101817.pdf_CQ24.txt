The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models for classifying environmental conditions and underwater fish species, but it does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline using a specific seed value. However, it does describe the use of random sub-sampling and random frame selection in the data preprocessing stage.

In the study by Xiao et al. (2021), five different datasets were generated using repeated random sub-sampling. Each set was then split into a training/testing split of 80/20, containing 9600 frames for training and 2400 for testing. This implies that randomness was introduced during the data preprocessing stage to ensure a diverse and representative sample for model training and testing.

Additionally, the frame selection process involved randomly selecting eight frames from each of the training and testing videos using a Python script with a uniform distribution. This random selection could result in frames from fish videos not containing any fish. However, this randomness was introduced to ensure a varied sample of frames for training the model to classify environmental conditions from images.

While not explicitly stated, the use of random sub-sampling and random frame selection can be seen as strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. These methods help ensure that the model is trained and tested on diverse and representative data, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving the model's generalizability.

In summary, although the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline using a specific seed value, it does discuss the use of random sub-sampling and random frame selection during data preprocessing. These strategies help ensure a diverse and representative sample for model training and testing, thereby handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
