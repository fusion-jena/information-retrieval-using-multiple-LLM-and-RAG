The provided context does not contain information about a deep learning pipeline or any code repository link related to it. The context mainly discusses an article about practical guide for retaining correlated climate variables and unthinned samples in species distribution modeling, using random forests. It mentions several papers and websites that were used or cited in the article, but none of them are related to a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
