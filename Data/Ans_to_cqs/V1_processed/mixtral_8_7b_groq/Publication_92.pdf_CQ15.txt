The text provided does not give explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used, and during the training phase, the CNN is given a database consisting of image-label pairs. This implies that some form of optimization algorithm would be used to adjust the weights of the network during training. Common optimization algorithms for training deep learning models include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop. Without further information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
