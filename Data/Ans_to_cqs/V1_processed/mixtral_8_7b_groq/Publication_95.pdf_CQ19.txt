The Keras framework is used to build the deep learning model. Specifically, the networks ResNet50-v2 and MobileNet-v2 are utilized for image classification, and these network structures are available in Keras. Keras is a high-level API that is based on TensorFlow, which is a widely-used open-source platform for machine learning. Therefore, both Keras and TensorFlow are used in building the deep learning model.
