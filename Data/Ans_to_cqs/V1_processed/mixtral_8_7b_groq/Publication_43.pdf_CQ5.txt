The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline in the given context are not explicitly specified. However, it can be inferred that the training dataset for the CNN-classifier is created using images of Ziziphus lotus shrubs and Bare soil with sparse vegetation. 

From the training-zone, 100 image patches of size 80x80 pixels are extracted for each class, i.e., Ziziphus lotus shrubs and Bare soil with sparse vegetation. Out of these 100 images, 80 images are used for training, and 20 images are used for validating the CNN classifiers. 

Therefore, the training dataset consists of 160 images, with 80 images for each class. The validation dataset consists of 40 images, with 20 images for each class. 

Furthermore, it can be inferred that the deep learning models, ResNet and GoogLeNet, are pre-trained on a large-scale dataset such as ImageNet, as they are commonly pre-trained on such datasets before being fine-tuned for specific tasks. However, the specific dataset used for pre-training is not mentioned in the given context. 

Therefore, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline in the given context are the training and validation datasets created using images of Ziziphus lotus shrubs and Bare soil with sparse vegetation, and a large-scale pre-training dataset such as ImageNet.
