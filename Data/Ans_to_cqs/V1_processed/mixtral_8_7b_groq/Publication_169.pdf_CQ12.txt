The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The CNN part of the model is used for extracting features from the input images, and it consists of 12 convolutional layers and five pooling layers. The convolutional layers use 3 × 3 kernels and are activated by the ReLU function, while the pooling layers use 2 × 2 kernels for reducing the dimensions of the input image.

After extracting the features from the input images, the model passes them to the LSTM layer, which is used for classification purposes. The LSTM layer receives the feature maps from the initial layers of the network and aggregates them effectively for precise classification. This combination of CNN and LSTM networks allows for accurate recognition of plant species from images.

The CNN architecture used in this work is similar to the ones used in image recognition applications, such as AlexNet, PredNet, GoogLeNet, Overfeat, and VGG. These architectures have been successfully applied to complicated tasks of visual imagery and are widely used in image data recognition.

Therefore, the deep learning model used in this pipeline is a combination of CNN and LSTM networks, where the CNN part is used for feature extraction, and the LSTM part is used for classification purposes.
