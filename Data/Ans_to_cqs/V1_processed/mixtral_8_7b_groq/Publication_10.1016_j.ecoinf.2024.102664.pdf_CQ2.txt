The data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the study is image data. The study focuses on the prediction of Chl (chlorophyll) values using deep learning models. The input to the deep learning models is segmented images of a specific size, and the time series structure of the model input and output is based on these segmented images.

The segmented images are generated by iteratively moving a window pixel-by-pixel over a grid of 100 x 40 points. Each segmented image is composed of 9 pixels, and the time step is set to 5. As a result, the data structure for the model input is 9 x 5 x 13, where 13 represents the number of input parameters.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in this study uses image data as the input format to predict Chl values. Other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV are not mentioned or used in this study.
