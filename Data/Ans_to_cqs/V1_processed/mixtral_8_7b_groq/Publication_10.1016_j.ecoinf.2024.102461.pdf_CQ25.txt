The deep learning model, as mentioned in the context, is used for the purpose of fire risk assessment in forest ecosystems. However, the specific type of deep learning model or task (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection) is not explicitly stated in the provided text.

In the context, Nguyen et al. (2018) and Iban & Sekertekin (2022) employed machine learning algorithms, including neural networks, to predict fire risk. While these techniques can be considered part of deep learning, the text does not explicitly mention using deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

In summary, the provided context does not contain enough information to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model (classification, segmentation, detection, or another task). The context mainly focuses on the use of machine learning algorithms for fire risk assessment and the comparison of their performance with different variables.
