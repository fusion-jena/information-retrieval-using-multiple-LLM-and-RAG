The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the top-1 and top-5 accuracy metrics. The top-1 accuracy measures the percentage of images for which the model correctly predicts the class label as the most probable one out of all the classes. On the other hand, the top-5 accuracy measures the percentage of images for which the model includes the correct class label in its top five most probable predictions out of all the classes. These metrics are used in the herbarium specimen classification, cross-herbaria transfer learning, and transfer learning from herbarium to non-dried plant images experiments as reported in the tables in the context. Other metrics such as precision and recall are not mentioned in the provided context.
