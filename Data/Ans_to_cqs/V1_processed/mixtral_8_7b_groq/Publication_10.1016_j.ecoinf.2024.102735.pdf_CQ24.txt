The provided context discusses the use of machine learning models, including random forest, for predicting algal-related parameters in water quality management. However, it does not directly mention strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, such as the use of a random seed value.

Deep learning pipelines often involve randomness in various stages, such as weight initialization, dropout, and data shuffling. A common strategy to handle randomness is the use of a fixed random seed value. By setting a specific seed value, the randomness in the pipeline can be made reproducible, allowing for consistent results across multiple runs.

In the context of the provided document, the random forest model is optimized using randomized subsets of training data. While this strategy does not directly involve a random seed value, it does demonstrate an approach to managing variability in model predictions. The authors use optimized models developed through randomized subsets of training data to estimate uncertainty bands for each ML model. This approach helps account for variability in model predictions and can be seen as a method for handling randomness in the modeling process.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, such as the use of a random seed value, it does discuss an approach for managing variability in model predictions using randomized subsets of training data. This method can be seen as an indirect way of handling randomness in the modeling process.
