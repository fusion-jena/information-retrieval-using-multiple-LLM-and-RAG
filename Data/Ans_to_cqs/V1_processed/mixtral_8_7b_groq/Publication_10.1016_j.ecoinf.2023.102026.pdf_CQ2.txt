The provided context does not give information about the specific deep learning pipeline used in the study. However, it does mention the use of camera trap data, which is typically in the form of image or video files.

The study uses camera trap data to train Random Forest (RF) models for predicting the presence of different felid species at various scales. The data is first preprocessed by selecting a representative scale for each covariate using univariate RF and the full camera traps dataset. Then, the RF models are trained using two different training data selection frameworks, one of which uses the same training dataset as the non-bootstrapped Generalised Linear Model (GLM) approach.

The training dataset is composed of randomly selected 80% of camera trap locations, but the format of this dataset is not specified in the context. It could be in the form of a CSV file containing the coordinates of the camera trap locations and the corresponding presence-absence data for each felid species. Alternatively, it could be in the form of a directory containing image or video files, with each file labeled with the presence or absence of each felid species.

Overall, while the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated in the context, it is likely that the pipeline includes image or video files from camera traps, as well as potentially CSV files containing location and presence-absence data.
