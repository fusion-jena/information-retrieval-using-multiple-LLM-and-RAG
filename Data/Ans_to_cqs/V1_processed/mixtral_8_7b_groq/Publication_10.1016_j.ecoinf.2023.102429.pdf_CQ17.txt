The provided context does not directly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does discuss several machine learning techniques and their applications in soil property estimation.


The context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Regularization techniques like dropout, L2 regularization, or early stopping are essential to prevent overfitting when training deep learning models. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero during training, helping to avoid over-reliance on specific neurons and reducing overfitting. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights and promotes a more generalized model. Early stopping halts training when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving, preventing the model from learning idiosyncrasies in the training data.

While the context does not discuss these specific regularization techniques, it does mention various machine learning algorithms and their applications in soil property estimation. These algorithms include Random Forest (RF), Continuum Removal (CR), Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA), Weight Average Partial Least-Squares Regression (WAPLSR), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), and others. These methods can be used in conjunction with deep learning models and benefit from regularization techniques to improve their predictive performance and prevent overfitting.
