The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does give some insight into the types of data being used and the possible formats.

The data being used in this study are related to Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes in the Amazon region. The LULC classes are defined in a table (Table 3) based on the CLC methodology, and these classes are represented by codes and RGB colors. This suggests that the data could be in a raster format, such as GeoTIFF, which is commonly used for remote sensing and GIS applications.

Additionally, the study calculates various spectral indices (Table 1) using spectral bands (B) from different datasets. These spectral bands could be provided in separate channels of a multi-band image, also likely in a raster format.

The use of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform is mentioned, which typically handles raster and vector data formats. However, GEE also supports various other data formats, such as CSV for tabular data.

Based on this context, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline in this study most likely uses raster data formats, such as GeoTIFF, for the LULC data and spectral bands. However, it is possible that other data formats, such as CSV, are also used for additional data or metadata.
