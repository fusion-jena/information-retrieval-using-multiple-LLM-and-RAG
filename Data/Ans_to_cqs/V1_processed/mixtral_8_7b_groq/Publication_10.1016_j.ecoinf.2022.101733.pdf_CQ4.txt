Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context mainly focuses on the use of different combinations of Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, and other data sources for land use and crop classification, as well as the feature selection and parameter optimization process.

However, data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, particularly for image-based tasks, to increase the size of the training dataset and improve model generalization. These techniques can create new samples by applying transformations to the existing data, such as horizontal or vertical flipping, rotation at different angles, and scaling or zooming in or out.

Given the nature of the problem and the use of remote sensing data, it is plausible to assume that data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline. For instance, when working with satellite images, rotating and scaling can help the model better generalize to different image orientations and resolutions. However, this information is not directly provided in the context, so it remains an assumption.
