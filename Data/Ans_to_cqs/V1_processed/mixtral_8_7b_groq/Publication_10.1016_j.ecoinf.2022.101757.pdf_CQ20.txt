Based on the information provided, the specific hardware resources used for training the DeepLabV3+ model are not mentioned. The context focuses on the dataset used (COCO), the model inference process, and the post-processing steps for extracting the objects below the skyline. However, it can be inferred that given the complexity of deep learning models like DeepLabV3+, a GPU or specialized hardware like a TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) was likely used to reduce training times. These types of hardware are commonly used for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel computations, which is essential for handling the large number of parameters and data involved in deep learning training. Therefore, while the specific hardware used is not specified, it is highly probable that a GPU or TPU was employed during the training process.
