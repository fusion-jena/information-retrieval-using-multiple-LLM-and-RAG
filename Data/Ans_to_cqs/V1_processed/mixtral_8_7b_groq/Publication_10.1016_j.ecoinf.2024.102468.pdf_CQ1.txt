The provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for whale vocalization studies. However, it does mention that the studies work with whale sound recordings, which implies that the data is collected using underwater recording devices or hydrophones.

For instance, the study by Ibrahim et al. (2018) focuses on North Atlantic Right Whale Up-Calls, which suggests the use of specialized equipment to record these specific whale calls. Additionally, the study by Kahl et al. (2021) on Birdnet, a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring, also implies the use of audio recordings collected through devices like microphones or audio recorders.

In general, for ecological studies involving animal vocalizations, data collection can be done through various methods, including:

1. Surveys: Organized surveys can be carried out to collect data, where researchers visit specific locations and record animal sounds using specialized equipment.
2. Sensors: Permanent or temporary sensors, such as hydrophones for underwater recordings, can be deployed in the environment to continuously collect data over a period.
3. Public datasets: Researchers can also use publicly available datasets collected by other researchers or organizations for their studies.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data collection methods, it can be inferred that underwater recording devices, such as hydrophones, are used for collecting whale sound recordings. Other methods, such as surveys and public datasets, can also be used for data collection in ecological studies involving animal vocalizations.
