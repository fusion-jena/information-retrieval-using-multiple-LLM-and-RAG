The provided context does not include information about the specific code repository or location where the deep learning pipeline used in the study is hosted. It is not uncommon for research papers to not include this information in the text, and it is possible that the authors have made the code available in a separate location or through personal communication.

 If you are interested in the specific details of the deep learning pipeline used in this study, I would recommend reaching out to the authors directly to inquire about the availability of the code. They can be contacted at the following email addresses: [M.M.Morgan@rpi.edu](mailto:M.M.Morgan@rpi.edu) and [J.Braasch@rpi.edu](mailto:J.Braasch@rpi.edu).

 Additionally, you may also want to check if the authors have published the code in any of the popular code repositories such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. You can search for the authors' names or the title of the paper in these platforms to see if the code is available.

 In summary, while the provided context does not include information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline, you can try contacting the authors directly or searching for the code in popular code repositories.
