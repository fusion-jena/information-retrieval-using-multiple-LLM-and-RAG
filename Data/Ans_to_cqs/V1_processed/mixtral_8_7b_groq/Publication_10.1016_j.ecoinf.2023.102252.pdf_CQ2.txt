The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The article's focus is on the development of a computationally efficient floodplain ecological response model for large-scale, data-sparse riparian environments. It discusses the use of environmental flow data and the mapping of these flows to ecological responses. However, it does not mention any specific data formats such as image, audio, video, or CSV.

The abstract mentions the use of "flow characteristics or hydrological metrics" and "biological indicators," but it does not clarify whether these are represented in specific data formats. In the context of the article, these terms likely refer to numerical or categorical data rather than multimedia formats like images or videos.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to accurately answer the query regarding the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
