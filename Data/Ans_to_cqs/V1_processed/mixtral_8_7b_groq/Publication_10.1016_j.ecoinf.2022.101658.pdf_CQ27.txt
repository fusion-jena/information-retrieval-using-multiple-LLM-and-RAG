The text provided does not give a detailed explanation of the process that was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model was trained using data collected at the Pelican Mountain (PM) and Calling Lake (CL) field sites, and then validated using data collected at the Conklin (CK) field site.

The process of training the model is described in Figure 4, which shows a transfer learning methodology. This means that the model was first pre-trained on a large dataset, and then fine-tuned using the ecological data collected in the PM and CL field sites.

As for model serialization and platform selection, the text does not provide specific details. Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model to disk so that it can be loaded and used later. This is often done using a format such as HDF5 or JSON. Platform selection refers to the choice of hardware and software environment where the model will be deployed. This could range from a local workstation to a cloud-based platform.

In summary, while the text provides some information about the training of the DCNN model, it does not give specific details about model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide a complete answer to the query.
