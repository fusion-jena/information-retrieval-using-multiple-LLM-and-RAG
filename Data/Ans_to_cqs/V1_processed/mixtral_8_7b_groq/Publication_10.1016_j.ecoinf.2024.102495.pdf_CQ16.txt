The context does not provide specific information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the CNN model. However, it is mentioned that the model was compiled using a categorical cross-entropy loss function and hyperparameters were tuned using a root mean square propagation (RMSProp) optimizer. Typically, in deep learning models, training is complete when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly, or when the model begins to overfit on the training data. It is possible that one or a combination of these criteria were used to determine when training was complete for this CNN model, but the context does not offer enough detail to make a definitive statement.
