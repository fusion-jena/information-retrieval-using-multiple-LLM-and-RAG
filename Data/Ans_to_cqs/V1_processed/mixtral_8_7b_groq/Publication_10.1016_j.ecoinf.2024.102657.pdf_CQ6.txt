Based on the provided context, there are limited details about the preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the bird song data was converted into spectrograms, and grams, which were used for training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) classifiers.

The context states that "no additional preprocessing was applied to the spectrograms" before training the CNN and k-NN classifiers. This suggests that the preprocessing steps were minimal and may have only included converting the bird song data into spectrograms.

Furthermore, it is mentioned that the goal was to demonstrate the power of human-machine teaming by doing the "least amount of preprocessing possible." This implies that the preprocessing steps were kept to a minimum, and only necessary steps were taken to convert the bird song data into a format that could be used for training the deep learning models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved converting the bird song data into spectrograms, and no additional preprocessing was applied before training the CNN and k-NN classifiers.
