The provided context does not give information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model, if any. The text focuses on the comparison of three machine learning algorithms, Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), for estimating the first flowering date and full blossom date of plants. The models were built using Python, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow libraries. The hyperparameters of the models were optimized using Optuna, and the performance of the algorithms was evaluated based on the loss function (mean squared error), mean absolute error, and the coefficient of determination.

The text mentions that the optimized ANN models did not have any intermediate layers, and the model with the input layer followed by the output layer was determined to be the best. However, it does not provide information about the deployment of the deep learning model on any cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
