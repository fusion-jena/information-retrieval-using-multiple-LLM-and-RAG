Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about a deep learning model being used in the study. However, it is mentioned that four methods were used to model forest above-ground biomass (AGB), including AdaBoost, random decision forest (RF), multilayer neural network (NET), and Bayesian ridge regression. Among these, AdaBoost and random decision forest were found to be the most successful methods for estimating AGB.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that is based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. It can be used for various tasks such as classification, segmentation, detection, and regression. However, based on the context provided, it is unclear whether a deep learning model was used for any of these tasks.

It is worth noting that the study by Zhang et al. (2019) mentioned in the context used a deep learning-based retrieval of forest biomass. However, the specific deep learning model used in that study is not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the purpose of the deep learning model as there is no information provided about its use in the study.
