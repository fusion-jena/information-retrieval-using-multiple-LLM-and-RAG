The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it does mention that hyperparameter optimization was used to improve the model performance. This process involves selecting a range of values for model hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and dropout, and determining the optimum selection to improve model performance. The context also states that the model performance was improved through hyperparameter optimization for the learning rate, using Hyperband and Bayesian Optimization techniques for the Extinction dataset. The F1-Scores were then obtained for the optimal learning rate, a higher value, and a lower value, and it was found that the optimal learning rate provided better model classification performance. Therefore, it can be inferred that the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training includes hyperparameter optimization and evaluating the model performance using metrics such as F1-Score.
