The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no information regarding techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other method for hyperparameter tuning.

The text does mention that a pre-trained ResNet50 model was used, which implies that some hyperparameters were inherited from the pre-trained model. However, it is possible that other hyperparameters were optimized using a method not described in the text.

In general, hyperparameter tuning is an important step in training machine learning models, as it can significantly impact model performance. Various methods exist for hyperparameter tuning, including grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and more. These methods involve systematically searching through a space of possible hyperparameter values to find the combination that yields the best model performance.

Without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized in this study.
