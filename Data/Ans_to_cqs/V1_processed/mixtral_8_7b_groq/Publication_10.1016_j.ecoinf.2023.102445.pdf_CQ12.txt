The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of various CNN components and modules. For instance, it mentions the use of a "backbone network" and a "neck network," both of which are typical terms used in CNN-based architectures. Additionally, it specifically mentions the use of the C2f module, which "encapsulates three operations, Conv2d convolution, BatchNorm2d and an activation function." These are all building blocks of a CNN. Furthermore, the context also mentions the comparison of the model's performance with other CNN-based models such as YOLOv5s-ECA, Fast-RCNN (Mobilenetv2), YOLOv5Ghost, and YOLOv7Tiny. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in this pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
