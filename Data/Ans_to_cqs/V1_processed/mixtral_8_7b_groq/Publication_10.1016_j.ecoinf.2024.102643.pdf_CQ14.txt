Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the models used in the study were optimized. The study by Vayssi`eres et al. (2000) and the unpublished study by Buonincontri et al. (2023) and Erickson and Smith (2023) mentioned in the context used the biomod2 package for ensemble modeling, but they did not provide details about the hyperparameter optimization process.

Hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in machine learning model building, as it helps to find the best set of parameters for the model to achieve optimal performance. Grid search and random search are two common methods used for hyperparameter optimization. Grid search involves systematically searching through a predefined set of hyperparameter values, while random search involves randomly selecting hyperparameter values within a defined range.

Therefore, it is unclear how the hyperparameters of the models used in the study were optimized. It would be best to refer to the original studies or the biomod2 package documentation for more information on the hyperparameter optimization process used in the study.
