Based on the provided context, there is no information about a specific code repository for a deep learning pipeline related to atmospheric correction (AC) for satellite images of plateau lakes.

The context includes several studies that have developed and tested various algorithms for AC in aquatic environments using different satellite sensors. However, none of the studies mentioned a code repository or provided a link to one.

The studies used various techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANN), random forest, and the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) model for AC. While the studies describe the methods and techniques used, they do not provide a code repository for replication or further development.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific code repository for the deep learning pipeline related to AC for satellite images of plateau lakes.
