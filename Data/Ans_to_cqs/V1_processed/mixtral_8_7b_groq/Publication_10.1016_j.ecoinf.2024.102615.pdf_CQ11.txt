The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the description of a machine learning model for predicting total phosphorus concentration in rivers using hyperspectral data. It describes the architecture of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, which includes an input layer with 4200 dimensions of spectral reflectance data, a hidden layer with 2048 neurons, batch normalization, and dropout layers. The optimal MLP architecture and parameters are also presented. However, there is no mention of the data repository link for this deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
