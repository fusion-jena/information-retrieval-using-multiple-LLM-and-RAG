The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the F1 score, which is a harmonic mean of precision and recall. Precision and recall are both important metrics in evaluating the performance of object detection models, with precision measuring the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, and recall measuring the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.

The F1 score provides a balanced assessment of both precision and recall, and is a commonly used and conservative measure of performance that balances missing predictions (false negatives or FN) and not predicting too many instances (false positives or FP). The F1 score takes its highest value of 1.0 when the model has excellent precision and recall, and its lowest value of 0 when either precision or recall are zero.

The deep learning model achieved high F1 scores on all training, validation, and testing data, indicating excellent precision and recall. Specifically, the model achieved F1 scores above 0.991 on all the training data, 0.934 on all validation data, and above 0.934 on all testing data. The model also achieved nearly perfect F1 scores at locations it had never seen before, reaching scores of 0.985, 1, and 1.

While other metrics such as accuracy or mean average precision (mAP) are commonly used in evaluating object detection models, the F1 score was chosen for this study because of its focus on the balance between precision and recall, and its ability to provide a conservative measure of model performance. The mAP metric, for example, measures the exact overlap between the ground truth and predicted bounding boxes, and may not be informative for studies where the exact overlap is not the primary focus.

In summary, the deep learning model's performance is evaluated using the F1 score, a harmonic mean of precision and recall. The model achieved high F1 scores on all training, validation, and testing data, indicating excellent precision and recall. The F1 score was chosen as the primary metric for this study due to its focus on the balance between precision and recall, and its ability to provide a conservative measure of model performance.
