Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context focuses primarily on the methodology, evaluation, and comparison of data-driven models for estimating crop evapotranspiration, rather than the technical aspects of model training.

However, it is generally understood that deep learning models often require substantial computational resources, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), to handle the complex computations and large datasets efficiently. These specialized hardware components can significantly accelerate the training process compared to using only Central Processing Units (CPUs).

Considering that the study involves machine learning methods, including artificial neural networks (as mentioned in Aslan-Sungur et al., 2023), it is plausible to assume that GPUs or TPUs were employed for training the deep learning models. Nonetheless, without specific information in the context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
