Based on the provided sources, there are several methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, including surveys, sensors, and public datasets.

In the context of water quality monitoring, Baek et al. (2020) utilized a sensor-based approach to collect raw data. Specifically, they used a water quality monitoring system that measured various water quality parameters such as pH, temperature, and turbidity. The data collected from these sensors were then used to train a deep learning model based on a CNN-LSTM (Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory) architecture for predicting water level and water quality.

Similarly, Meng et al. (n.d.) used a sensor-based approach to collect raw data for their study on water quality assessment. They used a water quality monitoring instrument to measure the reflectance of water at different bands, which were then used as input features for their CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model.

In addition to sensor-based approaches, public datasets can also be used as raw data sources in deep learning pipelines. For instance, Campbell et al. (2022) conducted a review of carbon monitoring in wet carbon systems using remote sensing. They mentioned various public datasets such as MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), Landsat, and Sentinel that can be used for monitoring carbon dynamics in wetlands. These datasets can be used as input features for training deep learning models for predicting carbon fluxes in wetlands.

Furthermore, surveys can also be used as a method for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines. Although none of the provided sources explicitly mentioned using surveys as a data collection method, surveys can be used to collect data on various environmental parameters that can be used as input features for training deep learning models. For example, surveys can be used to collect data on land use patterns, soil properties, or vegetation cover, which can be used as input features for training deep learning models for predicting soil erosion, crop yields, or carbon sequestration.

In summary, the provided sources suggest that sensors, public datasets, and surveys can be used as methods for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines. Sensor-based approaches can be particularly useful for monitoring water quality parameters, while public datasets can be useful for monitoring carbon dynamics in wetlands. Surveys can be used to collect data on various environmental parameters that can be used as input features for training deep learning models for predicting various environmental outcomes.
