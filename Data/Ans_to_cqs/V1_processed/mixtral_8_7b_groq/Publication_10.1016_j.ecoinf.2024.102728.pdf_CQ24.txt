In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, some of the sources discuss aspects of deep learning and related concepts that can provide some insight into how randomness is managed in this field.

Deep learning models often use random initialization to break symmetry and improve training, such as initializing weights randomly in neural networks (Mohedano et al., 2017). While not explicitly stated, using a fixed random seed value ensures reproducibility of the results by initializing the random number generator with the same value, leading to the same sequence of random numbers.

In the context of emergent properties, randomness can play a role in the behavior of complex systems (MÃ¼ller & Nielsen, 2008). Deep learning models can be seen as complex systems, and managing randomness is crucial for understanding and controlling their behavior.

In the field of ecology, randomness is often addressed using hierarchy theory, which provides a framework for understanding complex systems by decomposing them into smaller, more manageable components (Wu, 2013; White & Jentsch, 2001). This approach can be applied to deep learning models, where randomness can be managed at different levels of hierarchy.

In the context of image retrieval, Wu et al. (2018) propose a weighted generalized mean pooling method that can potentially handle randomness by combining features from different levels of abstraction. This method calculates a weighted mean of features, where the weights are determined by the importance of each feature in the classification task. By combining features in this way, the model can potentially handle randomness more effectively.

Cohen and Shashua (2017) discuss the inductive bias of deep convolutional networks through pooling geometry. Pooling is a common technique used in deep learning to reduce dimensionality and manage randomness. By pooling features, the model can capture more abstract, higher-level features that are less sensitive to random variations in the input data.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does discuss concepts and techniques that can be used to manage randomness. These include using fixed random seed values, applying hierarchy theory, employing pooling techniques, and combining features using weighted generalized mean pooling.
