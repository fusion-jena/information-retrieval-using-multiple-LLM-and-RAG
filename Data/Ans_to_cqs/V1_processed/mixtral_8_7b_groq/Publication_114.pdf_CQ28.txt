The provided context does not specify the platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model. The context focuses on the use of deep learning approaches, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for remote sensing applications, particularly in the classification of trees and forests. The authors discuss various CNN architectures, such as AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet, and their performance in remote sensing applications. They also mention the use of a U-net convolutional neural network for extracting woody vegetation extent from high-resolution Earth-I imagery. However, the context does not provide information on the platform used for deploying the deep learning model.
