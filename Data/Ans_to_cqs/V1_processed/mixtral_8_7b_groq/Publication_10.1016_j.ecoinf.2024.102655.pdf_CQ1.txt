The context provided does not give specific information about how raw data is collected in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study uses a dataset of 42 water quality parameters (WQPs) from 13 monitoring sites along the Santiago-Guadalajara River. It can be inferred that the data was collected using sensors or other monitoring equipment deployed at these sites. The dataset was then subjected to pre-processing, including outlier detection and artificial data replacement.

Additionally, the study uses a variety of data analysis techniques, including time series analysis, cluster analysis, and the Water Quality Index. These methods are used to train machine learning models and evaluate their performance. However, the context does not provide information on how the raw data for these methods was originally collected.

Therefore, while it can be inferred that the raw data was collected using sensors or other monitoring equipment, the specific methods used for data collection are not mentioned in the provided context.
