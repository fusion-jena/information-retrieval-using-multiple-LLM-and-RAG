Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context includes details about the authors, affiliations, and the journal in which the study is published. It also provides a brief abstract of the study, which focuses on a deep learning-based pipeline for whitefly pest abundance estimation using chromotropic sticky traps. The study includes a training step and a test split for model evaluation, and it notes the presence of other insect species and contaminants in the images used.

However, the context does not mention the code repository or where the code for the deep learning pipeline can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
