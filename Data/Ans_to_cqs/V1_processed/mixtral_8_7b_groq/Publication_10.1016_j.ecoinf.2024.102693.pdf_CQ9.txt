The context provided does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It mainly focuses on comparing the performance of different models such as ResNet-50, ViT-S/16, Volo-d1, and ViP-Small/7 in the IP102 dataset.

However, it is mentioned that the superior performance of a Vision Transformer (ViT) can be primarily attributed to extensive pre-training data. A ViT model trained from scratch on a medium-sized dataset lags behind a CNN model with comparable parameter sizes. To address this limitation, the authors proposed Volo with a novel Outlook Attention as the token mixer module.

Furthermore, the context explains the core structure of the transformer-like visual model, which comprises an encoder module with several stacked blocks. Each block consists of two components: a token mixer module for fusing spatial information and an MLP module for fusing channel information.

Therefore, while the context provides valuable information about the performance of different models and their structures, it does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.
