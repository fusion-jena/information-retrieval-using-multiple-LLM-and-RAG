The provided context does not give specific information about how the raw data was collected for the datasets used in the research. However, it does mention that the datasets were shared by Jiang et al. (2020) through a Github repository, which suggests that the data may have been collected and shared by the research community.

In general, there are various methods for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines, including but not limited to:

1. Surveys: Surveys can be used to collect data from human respondents. For example, in the context of agriculture, surveys could be used to collect data on crop yields, soil conditions, and farming practices.
2. Sensors: Sensors can be used to collect data from the environment. For example, in the context of agriculture, sensors could be used to collect data on temperature, humidity, light levels, and soil moisture.
3. Public datasets: Public datasets are often available for research purposes. For example, in the context of computer vision, public datasets such as ImageNet and COCO are commonly used for training deep learning models.
4. Private datasets: Private datasets are often collected by organizations for their own use. For example, a company may collect data on customer behavior for use in targeted advertising.

It's worth noting that the choice of data collection method will depend on the specific research question and the availability of data. In some cases, it may be necessary to collect new data through surveys or sensors, while in other cases, existing public or private datasets may be sufficient.
