The provided context discusses the use of dropout as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline, specifically in a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. However, it does not mention the use of L2 regularization.

In the CNN model, dropout is applied in the form of a dropout layer that inactivates random nodes containing learnable weights. This helps in reducing overfitting by preventing the co-adaptation of feature detectors, which can lead to a reduced generalization performance of the model. The random node inactivation rate in the dropout layer used in the CNN model is 40%.

While L2 regularization is not mentioned in the provided context, it is another commonly used regularization method to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, which can help in reducing overfitting by preventing the learning of overly complex patterns in the training data that may not generalize well to unseen data.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline described in the provided context uses dropout as a regularization method to prevent overfitting. However, it is worth noting that L2 regularization is another commonly used regularization method that could have been used in addition to or instead of dropout.
