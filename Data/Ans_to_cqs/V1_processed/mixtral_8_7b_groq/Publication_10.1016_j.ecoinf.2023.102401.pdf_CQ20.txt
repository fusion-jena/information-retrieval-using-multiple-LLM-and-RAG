The deep learning model is trained using specific hardware resources, including a GPU and a CPU. The GPU used is a GeForce RTX 3060 with 12G of memory. This GPU is responsible for handling the computationally intensive tasks during the model's training process. The CPU used is an Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5–1620 v3 CPU @ 3.50 GHz. Although the CPU plays a crucial role in overall system operations, the GPU is the primary hardware resource for training the deep learning model due to its superior capabilities in handling matrix and vector operations, which are fundamental to the training of deep learning models.

In addition to the GPU and CPU, the training process also involves other hardware components, such as the RAM and the storage devices. The specific type and size of the RAM and storage devices are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, they are essential for temporarily storing data during computations and for storing the datasets, respectively.

It is also worth noting that the deep learning model is implemented using the PyTorch framework, which is a popular open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library. PyTorch provides an interface for designing and training deep learning models, and it is compatible with various hardware resources, including GPUs and TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). However, in this specific case, only a GPU is used for training the deep learning model.

In summary, the deep learning model is trained using a GeForce RTX 3060 GPU, an Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5–1620 v3 CPU, and other unspecified hardware components, such as RAM and storage devices.
