The context provided does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework was used to build the model. However, it is mentioned that the model is a Yolo (You Only Look Once) model, which is an object detection system developed by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi. Yolo has been implemented using various deep learning frameworks such as Darknet, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Therefore, it can be said that the model was likely built using one of these frameworks, but without more specific information, a definitive answer cannot be given.
