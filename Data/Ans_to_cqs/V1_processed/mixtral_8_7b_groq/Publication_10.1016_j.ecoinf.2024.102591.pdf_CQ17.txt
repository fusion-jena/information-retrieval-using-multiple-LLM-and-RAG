The provided context discusses the implementation of a machine learning algorithm, specifically Random Forest (RF), in the FIREMAP system for retrieving FCOVER from post-fire Sentinel-2 (S2) scenes. However, the context does not mention any deep learning pipelines or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or L2 regularization.
