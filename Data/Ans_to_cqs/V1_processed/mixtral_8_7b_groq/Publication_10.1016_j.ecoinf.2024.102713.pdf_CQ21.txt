Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about postprocessing steps involved after model training such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context focuses on the introduction of CASE, its relational schema, data sources, and the creation of a multidimensional spatial cube called Captures for analytical fruition.

However, it can be inferred that CASE might involve some sort of machine learning or statistical models for analyzing the data collected from various sources. In such cases, postprocessing steps like Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, and Confusion matrix can be essential for evaluating and understanding the model performance.

Saliency maps, for instance, can help visualize the importance of input features in the model's decision-making process. Metrics calculation, on the other hand, can provide a quantitative assessment of the model's performance using measures like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A Confusion matrix, further, can offer a more detailed breakdown of the model's performance, particularly in cases of multiclass classification problems.

Given that the context does not provide specific details about the postprocessing steps, it can be assumed that these steps are not part of the CASE system or are not considered relevant to discuss in the given context. Nonetheless, these steps are crucial in many machine learning and data analysis pipelines, and users should consider incorporating them based on their specific requirements and objectives.
