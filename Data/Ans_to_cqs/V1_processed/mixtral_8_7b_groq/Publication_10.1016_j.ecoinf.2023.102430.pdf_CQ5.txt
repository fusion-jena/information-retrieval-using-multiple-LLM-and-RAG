The provided context does not explicitly mention the names of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the algorithms were trained and tested on a dataset of 6570 pictures, which was reduced to 5256 pictures for training and testing. The pictures were of specimens from the Triatominae family, and the assessment of the algorithms focused on identifying the three major genera of this family. Therefore, it can be inferred that the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is a custom dataset of Triatominae specimens.
