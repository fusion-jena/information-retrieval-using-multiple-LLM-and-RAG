The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the implementation of a K-fold cross-validation technique and random under-sampling to address class imbalance during the training phase of machine learning algorithms.

Cross-validation is a powerful technique to prevent overfitting by evaluating the model's performance on unseen data. In this case, a four-fold cross-validation was employed, where the dataset was divided into four mutually exclusive folds through stratified sampling. Each fold was used as the validation set once, while the remaining three folds constituted the training set. This process allowed the model to be trained and tested on different subsets of the data, reducing the likelihood of overfitting.

Random under-sampling (RUS) was applied to the training set to tackle class imbalance. Although this technique does not directly address overfitting, it can indirectly contribute to preventing overfitting by creating a more balanced dataset. By reducing the majority class instances, RUS helps to improve the model's generalization capability, which can lead to better performance on unseen data and, consequently, reduced overfitting.

As for the regularization methods specifically mentioned in the query, such as dropout and L2 regularization, the context does not provide enough information to determine if they were used in the deep learning pipeline. Dropout is a regularization technique used in neural networks to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out a proportion of hidden units during training. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function, which encourages smaller weights and helps to reduce overfitting.

In summary, while the provided context discusses techniques that can indirectly contribute to preventing overfitting, such as cross-validation and random under-sampling, it does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization as regularization methods to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
