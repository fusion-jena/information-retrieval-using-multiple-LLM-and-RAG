The provided context does not include information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other method for hyperparameter tuning. The text focuses on presenting the results of a species distribution model for the gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), including tables summarizing the model, classification tables, and variables in the equation. However, it does not delve into the specifics of the optimization process for the model's hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
