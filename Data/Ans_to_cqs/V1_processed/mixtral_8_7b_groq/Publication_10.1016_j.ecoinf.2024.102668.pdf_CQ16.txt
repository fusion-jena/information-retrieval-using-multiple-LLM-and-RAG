Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the comparison of coherence measures and frequency responses between different acoustic recording devices.

However, in the field of machine learning and training models, a common criterion to determine training completion is when the validation loss plateaus or shows only a negligible decrease after a certain number of epochs. This indicates that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data and further training would not significantly improve its performance.

In the context of the controlled test, they compared 15 AudioMoth recorders against 2 SM4s, recording a white noise signal simultaneously. They obtained 119 recordings from each recorder and applied a specific methodology for comparison within a common frequency range. This process aimed to identify frequency bands where recorders show comparable performance, but it does not provide information on training completion criteria.

In summary, while the provided context does not contain specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, a common approach in machine learning is to consider training complete when the validation loss plateaus.
