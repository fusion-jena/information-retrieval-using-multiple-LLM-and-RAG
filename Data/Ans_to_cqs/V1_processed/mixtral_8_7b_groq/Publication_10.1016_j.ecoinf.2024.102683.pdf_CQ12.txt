The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of CNN for processing the folds of data in the proposed FAA-based approach. Additionally, it is stated that CNN-based methods have better performance in identifying plants, and the proposed approach (SCAM-Herb model) also uses CNN as its foundation. CNNs are a popular choice for computer vision tasks such as image classification and plant identification due to their ability to effectively extract features from images.
