The text provided gives some insight into the deep learning model's development and its benefits but does not explicitly describe the process of deploying the trained model. However, based on common practices in deep learning model deployment, we can infer some possible steps that might have been taken.

Firstly, after training the model, it is common to serialize the model for deployment. Model serialization involves saving the model's architecture, learned parameters, and other relevant information into a file. This file can then be loaded and used for inference without needing to retrain the model. The text mentions a faster model loading time, which could be a result of efficient model serialization.

Secondly, the platform for deployment would depend on the specific requirements of the project. The text mentions that the model is designed for real-time species recognition on basic hardware, which suggests that the model was deployed on a relatively low-resource platform. This could be a mobile device, an edge computing device, or a server with limited computational capabilities.

Thirdly, the model's performance on the target platform would need to be tested. This involves running the model on the platform and measuring its inference time, accuracy, and other relevant metrics. The text mentions a 17.65% increase in FPS (frames per second), which could be a result of this optimization process.

Lastly, the model would need to be integrated into the larger system in which it will be used. This could involve creating an application programming interface (API) for the model, integrating the model into an existing application, or developing a new application specifically for the model.

In conclusion, while the text does not provide explicit details about the process of deploying the trained deep learning model, it is possible to infer some likely steps based on common practices in deep learning model deployment. These steps could include model serialization, platform selection, performance testing, and integration into the larger system.
