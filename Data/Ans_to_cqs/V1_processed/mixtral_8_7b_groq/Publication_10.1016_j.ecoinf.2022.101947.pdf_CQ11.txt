I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context mainly discusses ecological studies related to various animal species, such as Amur tigers, leopards, lowland tapirs, and giant pandas. It also mentions the usage of FIT (Flexible Independent Transects) and machine learning techniques in some of these studies. However, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link for it.
