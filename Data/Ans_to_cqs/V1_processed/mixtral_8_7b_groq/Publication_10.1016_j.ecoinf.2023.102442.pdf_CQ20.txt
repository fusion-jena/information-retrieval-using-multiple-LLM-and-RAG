The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was trained using a cloud-based platform, Google Earth Engine (GEE), which provides access to high performance and rapid planetary-scale processing and analysis of images. GEE allows for access, selection, and processing of satellite images in seconds to minutes, compared to hours it would take using other conventional non-cloud databases. While the specific hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs are not specified, it can be assumed that Google Earth Engine utilizes these types of hardware to enable high performance and rapid processing of large satellite image datasets.
