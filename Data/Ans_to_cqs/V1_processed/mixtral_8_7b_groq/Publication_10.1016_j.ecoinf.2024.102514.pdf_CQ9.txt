Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several studies and sources, but none of them mention or provide a link to a data repository on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.

The studies mainly focus on the methodology, results, and applications of machine learning techniques for predicting water quality and assessing ecological systems. While they provide insights into the use of data splitting, cross-validation, and predictive models, they do not mention the data repository.

Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to determine the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It is recommended to contact the authors of the relevant studies for more information.
