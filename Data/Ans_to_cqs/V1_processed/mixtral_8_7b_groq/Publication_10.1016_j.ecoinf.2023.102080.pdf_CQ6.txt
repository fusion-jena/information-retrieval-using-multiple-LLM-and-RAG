The provided context discusses a two-step "embedded" covariate selection procedure for species distribution models (SDMs), which is implemented in the covsel R package. This procedure combines a collinearity-filtering algorithm with model-specific regularization techniques to select an accurate and parsimonious set of covariates from a high-dimensional candidate space. However, the context does not provide information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

In general, preprocessing data is an essential step before training any machine learning model, including deep learning models. Preprocessing can include various steps, such as:

1. Data cleaning: This step involves identifying and handling missing or invalid data points. Missing data can be handled by imputation methods, such as mean imputation, median imputation, or using machine learning algorithms to predict missing values. Invalid data points can be handled by removing them or transforming them to valid values.
2. Data normalization: This step involves scaling the data to a similar range to avoid bias towards features with larger ranges of values. Normalization can be achieved by various methods, such as min-max scaling, z-score scaling, or decimal scaling.
3. Data transformation: This step involves converting the data to a different format that may be more suitable for the machine learning algorithm. For example, categorical variables can be encoded as numerical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
4. Data reduction: This step involves reducing the dimensionality of the data to avoid the curse of dimensionality and improve computational efficiency. Data reduction can be achieved by various methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), or t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE).

The specific preprocessing steps required for a deep learning model may depend on the type of data and the specific deep learning algorithm used. For example, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) may require image normalization and augmentation, while recurrent neural networks (RNNs) may require sequence padding and truncation.

Therefore, it is essential to carefully preprocess the data before training a deep learning model to ensure that the model can learn effectively from the data.
