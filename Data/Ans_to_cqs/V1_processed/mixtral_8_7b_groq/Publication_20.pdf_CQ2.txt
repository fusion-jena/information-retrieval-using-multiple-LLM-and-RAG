Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline utilizes image data format for training and testing the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. Specifically, the raw training dataset consists of 20 fish species, and from this, four different datasets were built to assess the influence of the dataset building on classification results. The first training dataset T1 contained raw fish thumbnails (T0) and their respective mirror images. This means that the fish images were flipped along the vertical axis to create mirror images, effectively doubling the number of thumbnails per fish individual and creating a more balanced dataset in terms of left-oriented and right-oriented individuals. This format of using image data, particularly fish thumbnails, was used throughout the study to train and test the CNN model. No other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV were mentioned in the provided context.
