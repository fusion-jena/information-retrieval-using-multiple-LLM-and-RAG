The provided context does not contain information about the deployment of a trained deep learning model. The text focuses on the use of the random forest model in R software to examine the drivers of invasive species richness and abundance. It discusses data sources, results, and data analysis methods, but it does not mention any steps related to deep learning model deployment such as model serialization or platform selection. Hence, I don't have enough information to provide an accurate answer to this query.
