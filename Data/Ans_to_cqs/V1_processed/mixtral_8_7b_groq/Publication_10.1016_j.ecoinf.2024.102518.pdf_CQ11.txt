The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context consists of several research papers and reports related to species distribution modeling, ecological niche models, and conservation of savannah elephants. However, none of these sources mention a deep learning pipeline or provide a link to a data repository for such a pipeline.

Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query.
