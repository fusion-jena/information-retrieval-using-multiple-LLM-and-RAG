The text provided discusses the use of various data formats in the context of image processing and classification, specifically for pre-processing of aerial imagery. However, it does not directly mention the data formats used in a "deep learning pipeline" that includes audio, video, or CSV files.

Based on the information provided, the data formats used in the image processing and classification pipeline are:

1. Raster images: The text mentions the use of 2009 NAIP imagery, which consists of four-band (R, G, B, and IR) raster images. Additionally, historical imagery is also used, although the number of bands is not specified.
2. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index): NDVI is a vegetation index derived from remote sensing data, calculated using the formula (NIR - RED) / (NIR + RED), where NIR and RED represent the reflectance values in the near-infrared and red bands, respectively. NDVI is used as a band for image segmentation and classification.
3. GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix) texture measures: For historical imagery, six GLCM texture measures are used. GLCM is a statistical method for analyzing texture in an image by calculating how often different combinations of pixel values occur in an image.

As for audio, video, or CSV files, there is no explicit information in the text about their use in the described pipeline. However, it is possible that these data formats could be used in other stages of a deep learning pipeline, depending on the specific problem and data available. For instance, audio or video files might be used as input for tasks related to speech recognition, audio event detection, or video analysis. CSV files could be used for tabular data related to the images, such as metadata, annotations, or labels for supervised learning.
