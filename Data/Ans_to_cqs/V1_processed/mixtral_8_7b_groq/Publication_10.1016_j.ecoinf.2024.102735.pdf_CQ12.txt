The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Random Forest (RF) models, which are a type of ensemble learning model that uses decision trees as its base estimator. While Random Forest models are not typically classified as deep learning models, they do share some similarities with deep learning models, such as their ability to learn complex patterns in data through the use of multiple layers (in this case, decision trees).

The context also mentions the use of high-frequency datasets to train the RF model, which allows the model to learn more patterns in the water quality datasets and improve chlorophyll-a predictions. The use of deeper trees in the continuous high-frequency data also suggests that the model is learning intrinsic water quality patterns.

However, the context does not mention the use of other deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to definitively say what type of deep learning model is used in the pipeline.
