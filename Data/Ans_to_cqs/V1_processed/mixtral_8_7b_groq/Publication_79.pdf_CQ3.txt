Deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been widely used in image analysis tasks, including those related to remote sensing and vegetation classification. These models learn features from input datasets and present increasing complexity through the layers of the network, often outperforming traditional machine learning algorithms.

In the context of deep learning for image segmentation and object detection, various data annotation techniques are employed to prepare the training data. These techniques include:

1. **Bounding box annotation**: This method involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in an image. The bounding boxes provide the spatial location of the objects and are used to train models for object detection tasks.

2. **Semantic segmentation**: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image according to the object class it belongs to. Semantic segmentation provides a pixel-wise classification of the image and is used to train models for image segmentation tasks.

3. **Instance segmentation**: Instance segmentation is an extension of semantic segmentation, where each object instance is individually segmented and labeled. This method provides a more detailed annotation, allowing for the identification and counting of individual objects in an image.

4. **Hierarchical classification**: In some cases, a hierarchical classification approach is used, where classes are organized into a tree-like structure. This method can be useful when dealing with complex classifications, such as the hierarchical classification of Brazilian Savanna physiognomies based on deep learning techniques.

In the context of the provided pieces of information, several works have employed these annotation techniques for various applications. For instance, Neves et al. (2020) used semantic segmentation for the classification of Brazilian savanna vegetation using high spatial resolution satellite data and a U-net architecture. Similarly, Torres et al. (2020) employed semantic segmentation using DeepLabv3+ variants for the detection of endangered tree species in Brazilian savanna.

In summary, the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and hierarchical classification. These techniques are used to prepare the training data for various image analysis tasks, such as object detection and image segmentation.
