Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific criterion used to determine when the training of the TPEBO-LSTM model is complete. However, it does mention that the model undergoes a training process comprising 10,000 iterations and systematically records the chosen hyperparameter combinations, associated training times, and loss values during each iteration.

One possible implication could be that the training is completed after a fixed number of iterations, in this case, 10,000. However, this is not a common practice in machine learning model training as it does not account for the validation loss plateau or early stopping, which are common strategies to prevent overfitting and ensure proper training.

Early stopping is a technique where training is halted if the validation loss does not improve after a certain number of epochs. This number is a hyperparameter that can be set by the user. The context does mention that the TPEBO-LSTM model integrates the input dataset, hyperparameter search range, optimization objective function, and algorithm predefined into the model, which could potentially include early stopping based on validation loss plateau.

However, without explicit information, it is not possible to definitively answer the query. It would be beneficial to have more information about the specific training procedure and early stopping criteria used in the TPEBO-LSTM model.
