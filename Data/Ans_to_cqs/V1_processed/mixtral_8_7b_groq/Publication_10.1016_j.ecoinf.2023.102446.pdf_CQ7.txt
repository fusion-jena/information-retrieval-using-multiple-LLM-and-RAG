Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for training a deep learning model (e.g., train, test, validation). The text focuses on describing the data collection, processing, and methodology used in a specific study, but it does not mention the data splitting approach.

The study used flux tower data for various variables, such as Respiration (RE), Net Solar Radiation (NSR), Air Temperature (TA), Wind Speed (WS), Relative Humidity (RH), and Precipitation (P). The data was collected over a period of two years, from December 2014 to November 2016, with a half-hour temporal resolution. The network computation considered lagged information (Ï„ = 1 to 12, i.e., 6 h). However, the context does not provide information about the data splitting criteria.

In some deep learning projects, data is typically split into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is employed to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is utilized to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Since the provided context does not mention the data splitting criteria, it is not possible to provide a specific answer based on the given information. If you need more details about the data splitting approach used in this study, you may need to consult the original research paper or contact the authors directly.
