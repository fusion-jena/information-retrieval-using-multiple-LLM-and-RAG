The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer in the fire risk map pipeline. However, it is stated that various modeling techniques including artificial neural networks, deep learning, and logistic regression are utilized. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can be a part of deep learning, and they are composed of interconnected layers of nodes or "neurons". These neurons process information using weights and biases, and the weights are adjusted during training to minimize the error.

In the study by Nguyen et al. (2018), they employed a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLP), which is a type of feedforward ANN. The MLP consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node in a layer is connected to all nodes in the next layer, and there are no connections within a layer or backwards. The MLP is a versatile model and can learn complex relationships between inputs and outputs.

On the other hand, in the study by Iban and Sekertekin (2022), they used seven machine learning techniques, but deep learning is not explicitly mentioned. They employed correlation analysis to determine the relationship between forest fire ignition points and variables, and found that elevation had the highest correlation with fire risk, while NDVI exhibited a low correlation.

Therefore, based on the provided context, a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, which is a type of ANN, is used in one of the studies. However, there is no clear evidence of using CNN, RNN, or Transformer in the pipeline.
