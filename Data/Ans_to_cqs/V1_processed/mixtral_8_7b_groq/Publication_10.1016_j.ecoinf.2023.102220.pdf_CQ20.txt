Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context mentions that the implementation of the machine learning methods, including the deep learning model, was carried out in Python using the TensorFlow and Scikit-learn libraries. However, it does not specify whether GPUs, TPUs, or any other hardware accelerators were used during the training process.

TensorFlow, one of the libraries used, is a machine learning framework that supports both CPU and GPU computations. It can be configured to run on GPUs to accelerate the training process, especially for deep learning models that require a significant amount of computational power. However, without explicit information in the context, it is impossible to determine if GPUs or any other hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model in this case.


The provided context does not contain information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. While TensorFlow supports GPU and CPU computations, no details are given regarding the configuration used in this study.
