Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. The text mentions the use of a larger FFT window size and cow-specific parameters in the model, but it does not specify the process or method used to determine these settings. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
