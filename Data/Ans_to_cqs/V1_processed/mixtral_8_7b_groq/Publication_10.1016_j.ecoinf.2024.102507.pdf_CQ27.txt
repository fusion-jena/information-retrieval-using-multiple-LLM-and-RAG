The provided context does not give specific details about the steps taken to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, it does provide information about the training process and some of the techniques used during that process.

The training data preparation involved preparing eight categories of ground truth images and extracting training samples. The model was built using Keras and TensorFlow, and the deep learning parameters were automatically adjusted during training. The training used both CPU and GPU resources. After training, the feature weight and optimal solution were obtained, and the correct rate was calculated through model evaluation.

One of the optimal simulation results was achieved through the utilization of data augmentation and flattened convolution kernels. The VGG19 network architecture was used, and a residual unit involving a short-circuit mechanism was added to overcome the issue of gradient disappearance and accuracy reduction in deep networks.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give specific information about the deployment of the trained model, it does indicate that data augmentation and the use of a customized VGG19 network architecture were important parts of the overall process.
