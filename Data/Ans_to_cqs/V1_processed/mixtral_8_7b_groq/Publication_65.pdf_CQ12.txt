The deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This is inferred from the context that mentions the use of TensorFlow, a Python framework primarily used for implementing and analyzing CNNs. Additionally, the specific models mentioned, such as FCN, U-Net, SegNet, and DeepLabv3+, are all CNN-based architectures designed for semantic segmentation tasks. These models are built using convolution, max-pooling, and deconvolution layers, which are fundamental components of CNNs. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline described in the provided context relies on CNN-based models.
