The provided context discusses the performance evaluation of a deep learning model for classifying thermal stratification in a reservoir. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific evaluation metrics used, such as accuracy, precision, or recall.

However, based on the context, we can infer that the model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

1. Testing Accuracy: The context states that the optimal model has a testing accuracy of 96.0%.
2. AUC (Area Under the Curve): The context also mentions that the optimal model has an AUC of 0.99. AUC is a metric used for evaluating binary classification models, and it measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve), which is a plot of the true positive rate against the false positive rate.
3. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Although MAE is not a classification metric, it is mentioned in the context as a metric used during the cross-validation process. It is a regression metric that measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction (i.e., it does not distinguish between overestimates and underestimates).

It is important to note that the context does not mention any other classification metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score. Nonetheless, the mentioned metrics provide a solid understanding of the model's performance in classifying thermal stratification.
