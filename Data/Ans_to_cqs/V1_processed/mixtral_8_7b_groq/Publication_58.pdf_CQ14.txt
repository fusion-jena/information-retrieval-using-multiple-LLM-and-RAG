Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the models, including the Deep Learning architectures and XGBoost, were optimized. The text does not mention any specific techniques such as grid search, random search, or others, that were used for hyperparameter tuning.

However, it is mentioned that the models were "fit" on the training set, and then run on the test set to obtain a complete mapping of land cover (LC) and land use (LU). Confusion matrices were extracted from these results, and four quality metrics were used for evaluation: Overall Accuracy (OA), Producer Accuracy (PA), User Accuracy (UA), and the F1-score.

It is also mentioned that learning techniques had difficulty distinguishing mines and bare soil classes, which suggests that some form of hyperparameter optimization was attempted, as this is a known challenge in remote sensing image classification.

Therefore, while the specific method of hyperparameter optimization is not mentioned in the provided context, it is likely that some form of optimization was performed to improve the models' performance.
