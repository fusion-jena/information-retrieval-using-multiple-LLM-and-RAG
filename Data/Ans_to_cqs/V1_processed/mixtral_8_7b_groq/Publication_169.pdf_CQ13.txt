The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are the default values of the Adam gradient descent algorithm in the Keras library. The specific values of these hyperparameters are not provided in the given context. However, the model uses the Adam optimization algorithm, which is a popular choice for training deep learning models due to its adaptive learning rate and ability to handle large datasets.

The Adam algorithm has several hyperparameters, including the learning rate, beta1, beta2, and epsilon. The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration of the optimization algorithm. Beta1 and beta2 are exponential decay rates for the moving averages of the gradient and squared gradient, respectively. Epsilon is a small constant added to the denominator to prevent division by zero.

In the given context, the authors mentioned that they optimized the model parameters using the Adam algorithm with all parameters set to default values. Therefore, we can assume that they used the default hyperparameters for the Adam algorithm in Keras. The default values for the Adam algorithm in Keras are learning rate = 0.001, beta1 = 0.9, beta2 = 0.999, and epsilon = 1e-8.

It is worth noting that the choice of hyperparameters can significantly affect the performance of the deep learning model. Therefore, it is essential to tune the hyperparameters to achieve the best performance. However, the authors did not mention any hyperparameter tuning in the given context. Instead, they used the default values of the Adam algorithm in Keras to optimize the model parameters.

In summary, the deep learning model used in the study is implemented with the CNN-LSTM architecture and optimized using the Adam algorithm with default hyperparameters. The hyperparameters used in the Adam algorithm are learning rate = 0.001, beta1 = 0.9, beta2 = 0.999, and epsilon = 1e-8.
