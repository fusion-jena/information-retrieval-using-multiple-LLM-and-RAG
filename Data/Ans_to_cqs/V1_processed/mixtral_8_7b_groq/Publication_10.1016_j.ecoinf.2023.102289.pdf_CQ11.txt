I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided context does not include information about the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of LaDeco, a landscape decoder developed using MXNet and GluonCV, and the ADE20K dataset. However, it does not mention where the code, models, or data for this pipeline are stored or shared. For more information on this, you may need to consult the original sources or contact the authors directly.
