Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the use of the HYSPLIT trajectory model for assessing changes in local and regional sources of dust contributing to an increase in dust loading over the Urmia Lake. It also explains a drought monitoring method using the EWT-DSE multiscale method in the Urmia Lake basin. However, neither of these discussions mention any specific techniques for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search, random search, or others.

Another part of the context introduces an empirical scaling function and a polynomial function Î²(x) for drought analysis, but again, there is no information about hyperparameter optimization for these models.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information on how the hyperparameters of the models are optimized.
