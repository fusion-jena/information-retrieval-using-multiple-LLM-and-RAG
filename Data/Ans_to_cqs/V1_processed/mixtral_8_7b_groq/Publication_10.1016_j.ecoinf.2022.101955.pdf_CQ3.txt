The provided context discusses various machine learning (ML) algorithms used in land use and land cover (LULC) classification, but it does not explicitly mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. However, I can provide some general information about common data annotation techniques in deep learning, particularly for computer vision tasks.

In deep learning pipelines, data annotation is the process of manually labeling or annotating data so that the model can learn to recognize and classify objects or regions of interest. Here are some common data annotation techniques:

1. Image classification: This is the simplest form of annotation, where an image is assigned to a single class or category. For example, annotating an image as 'dog', 'cat', or 'car'.

2. Bounding box annotation: In this technique, a bounding box is drawn around an object of interest in an image. This helps the model learn to recognize and locate objects within an image. For example, bounding box annotation can be used for detecting cars, pedestrians, or bicycles in a street scene.

3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class or category. This helps the model learn to distinguish between different regions or objects within an image. For example, semantic segmentation can be used for segmenting buildings, roads, or trees in a satellite image.

4. Instance segmentation: This is a more advanced form of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and labeled separately. This helps the model learn to distinguish between individual objects of the same class. For example, instance segmentation can be used for counting the number of cars in a parking lot.

5. Keypoint annotation: In this technique, specific points or keypoints are annotated on an object of interest. This helps the model learn to recognize and locate key features of an object. For example, keypoint annotation can be used for facial recognition or pose estimation.

The provided context mainly focuses on machine learning algorithms used in LULC classification, such as kNN, SVM, ANN, and RF. While these algorithms can be used in deep learning pipelines, the specific data annotation techniques used would depend on the task and the type of data being used.
