I don't know the answer to the user's query. The provided context includes information about various studies and datasets related to groundwater, climate interactions, and drought characteristics. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link in the context. A data repository link would be necessary to access the deep learning pipeline, but it has not been provided. Therefore, I am unable to answer this query without additional information.
