Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the specific deep learning model used, its architecture, or its hyperparameters such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context focuses on the evaluation of the effectiveness of models in correcting sampling bias for species distribution modeling, without delving into the specifics of the models' configurations.

The sources mentioned in the context include a study on the niche expansion of Crofton weed following invasion in China (Xian et al., 2023), a geographical similarity-based sampling method for spatial prediction of forest fires (Xu, Li, Liu, & Wang, 2023a), land-use change modeling with cellular automata (Xu, Zhu, & Liu, 2023b), and a paper discussing the representativeness and spatial bias of volunteered geographic information (Zhang & Zhu, 2018). However, none of these sources provide information on the hyperparameters of a deep learning model.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information about the hyperparameters of the deep learning model used in the study.
