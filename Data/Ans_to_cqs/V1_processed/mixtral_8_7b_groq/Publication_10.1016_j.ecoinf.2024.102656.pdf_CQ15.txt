Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. The text focuses on the application of ecological informatics and conservation area (CA) networks for protecting ungulates' habitats, such as wild goat, Urial, and Jebeer gazelle. It discusses the calculation of core habitats' area, percentage of protected core habitats, length of roads intersecting core habitats, connectivity prediction, and the proportion of core habitats and corridors within CAs. However, it does not mention any specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query based on the given context.
