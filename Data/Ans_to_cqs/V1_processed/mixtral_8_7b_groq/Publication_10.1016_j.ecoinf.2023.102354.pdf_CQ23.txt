The text provided does not give specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in the study. However, it does mention that the study used GLDAS observations from 2002 to 2017 to obtain SMS data, and GLDAS-derived SMS was used with GRACE-derived TWS to quantify GWS variations across the region. This suggests that the model may have been trained on data from multiple years, which could help improve its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

In addition, the study considered multiple hydrological components and climate indices/teleconnections, including TWS, SMS, SPEI (3,6 and 12), ENSO, NAO, AMO, PDO, and IOD. This diverse set of inputs may have helped the model learn a wider range of relationships and patterns, which could also improve its ability to generalize.

However, without more information about the specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the model, it is difficult to provide a more definitive answer to this query. It is possible that the study used techniques such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, and stratified splitting to help ensure that the model would perform well on new data, but the text provided does not explicitly confirm this.
