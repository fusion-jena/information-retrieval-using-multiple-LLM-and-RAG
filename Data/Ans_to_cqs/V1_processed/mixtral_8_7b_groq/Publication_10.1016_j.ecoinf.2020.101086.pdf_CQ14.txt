Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text does not mention any specific methods such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization techniques.

However, it is mentioned that the correction methods were parameterized using knowledge from the literature and experts in the ecology of the An. darlingi species. It is also mentioned that one hundred replicates were generated for each set of presence sites and for each value of k. This suggests that some form of cross-validation or re-sampling may have been used to evaluate the performance of the models, but the specific optimization method is not mentioned.

Furthermore, the text compares the performance of different correction methods using metrics such as ΔDenv, ΔDgeo, and ΔAUC. It is possible that these metrics were used to guide the selection of hyperparameters, but the specific optimization method is not mentioned.

Therefore, while the text provides some information about the parameterization of the correction methods, it does not provide enough information to answer the query about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
