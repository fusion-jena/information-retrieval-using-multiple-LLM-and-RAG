The deep learning pipeline in the study referred to in the provided context uses data stored in NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) files. NetCDF is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-structured data. It is a popular format in scientific computing for storing and sharing multidimensional data arrays, such as those used in satellite data.

The NetCDF files in this study contain satellite image data from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors. These sensors measure solar radiation reflected by the Earth in various spectral bands. The OLCI sensor has a spatial resolution of 300 m and measures reflected radiation in 21 spectral bands. The MODIS sensor provides data in 44 different standard data products, classified into Atmosphere, Land, Cryosphere, and Ocean products.

The satellite image data in the NetCDF files include vital biogeophysical parameters such as reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), and Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations. These parameters are obtained from the processing of the satellite images and are used in the deep learning pipeline to monitor and analyze the Earth's surface and atmosphere.

Therefore, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline in this study is NetCDF, which contains satellite image data in various spectral bands and biogeophysical parameters. The data is not explicitly mentioned as being in image, audio, video, or CSV format.
