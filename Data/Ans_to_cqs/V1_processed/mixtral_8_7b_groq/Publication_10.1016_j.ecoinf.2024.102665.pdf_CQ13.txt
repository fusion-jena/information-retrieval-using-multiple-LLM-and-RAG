Based on the provided context, there is not enough information to determine the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model developed by Do and Tran (2023). Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned from the data but are set prior to training, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, and number of layers or units in a neural network.

In the context provided, the authors mention using a deep learning model in combination with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming. However, they do not provide details on the specific hyperparameters used in their deep learning model.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query. It is possible that the authors did not include this information in their paper or that it was not relevant to the focus of their study. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the choice of hyperparameters can significantly impact the performance of a deep learning model, and it is common practice to tune these hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
