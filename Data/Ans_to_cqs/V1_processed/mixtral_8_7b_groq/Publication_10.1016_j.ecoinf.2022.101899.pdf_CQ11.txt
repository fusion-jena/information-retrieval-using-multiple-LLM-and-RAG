Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about a specific deep learning pipeline or a data repository link associated with it. The first two sources, Charizanos and Demirhan (2023), are related to ecological informatics but do not mention any deep learning pipeline or data repository. Halgamuge et al. (2020) focus on utilizing deep learning for wildfire event predictions in Australia, but they do not specify the data repository link for their deep learning pipeline. Dowdy (2020) discusses a seasonal prediction system for wildfire event prediction, but again, there is no information about the data repository link for their pipeline.

The context does mention the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) datasets for extracting NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data. However, this information does not directly provide a data repository link for a deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the provided context does not include the necessary information to answer the query about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
