Based on the provided context, there is no specific deep learning model mentioned or described in the given text. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact purpose of the deep learning model in this case (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection).

However, the context does provide some information about the overall goal of the study, which may help to infer a possible purpose for a deep learning model. The study focuses on feature-based and shape-match classifications of animal population time series. Specifically, the authors use Gompertz population models for the feature extractions of population time series, and they apply dynamic time warping and hierarchical clustering for the classification of these time series.

Given this information, one possible purpose for a deep learning model in this context could be for improving the accuracy or efficiency of the feature extraction or classification tasks. For example, a deep learning model could be used to learn more complex or subtle features from the population time series data, which could then be used as inputs to the Gompertz population models or the dynamic time warping and hierarchical clustering algorithms. Alternatively, a deep learning model could be used to directly classify the population time series, potentially by learning more abstract or high-level representations of the data that capture the underlying patterns or trends.

Overall, while the provided context does not specify the exact purpose of a deep learning model, it is possible that such a model could be used to enhance the feature extraction or classification tasks in this study. However, further information would be needed to confirm this hypothesis and to determine the specific details of the deep learning model and its intended purpose.
