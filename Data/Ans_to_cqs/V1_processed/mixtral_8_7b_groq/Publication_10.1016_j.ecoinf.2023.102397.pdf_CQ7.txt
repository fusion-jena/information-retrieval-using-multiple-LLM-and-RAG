Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, I can provide some insights based on the common practices in machine learning and the information available in the context.

In machine learning, it's common to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

In the provided context, there are several sets of data, such as T15\_S2, T15\_S3, T25\_S2, T25\_S3, T50\_S2, T50\_S3, T100\_S2, T100\_S3, T150\_S2, T150\_S3, T200\_S2, T200\_S3, Test\_S2, Test\_S3, and Target set. However, it's not clear how these sets are used in the deep learning model training process.

Moreover, the context describes the process of training a random forest model using the best replicate and threshold on the test set and evaluating its performance. However, it does not mention any validation set or how the model's hyperparameters are tuned.

Therefore, while there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it can be inferred that the data is split into training and testing sets, and possibly a validation set, based on common practices in machine learning. However, the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific criteria used for the data split.
