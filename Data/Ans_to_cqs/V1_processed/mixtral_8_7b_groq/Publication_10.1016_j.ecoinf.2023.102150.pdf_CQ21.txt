Based on the provided context, there is no information about specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or metrics calculation after model training. However, there is some information about model retraining and manual classification.

After model training, the researcher can evaluate the model performance and decide whether to improve it by selecting new training images and retraining the model. This process is called model retraining. When selecting new training images, the researcher can use the model output from the original model to find images that meet certain criteria, such as images of a certain species. However, all training images should be reviewed manually instead of relying on model outputs only to avoid misclassified training images.

Once new training images are selected and the model is retrained, the researcher may engage in manual classification. This involves classifying some images from previous years to the training data set and retraining the neural network.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or metrics calculation, it does discuss model retraining and manual classification as steps that may be taken after initial model training.
