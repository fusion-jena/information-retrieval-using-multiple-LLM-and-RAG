Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, I can provide some information that might be relevant to the context of the data analysis discussed in the text.

The context discusses two visual surveys conducted in different years, 2010 and 2011, where researchers collected data on marine mammal sightings and underwater vocalizations. The data analysis process for this research involved several steps, including data collection, data cleaning, data analysis, and reporting.

In the context of deep learning model deployment, the following steps might have been taken based on common practices:

1. Model Training: The researchers might have trained a deep learning model on a labeled dataset of marine mammal vocalizations, using a machine learning platform such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
2. Model Evaluation: After training, the researchers would have evaluated the model's performance on a separate validation dataset to ensure that it was accurately classifying the different song variants or patterns.
3. Model Serialization: Once the model was trained and evaluated, the researchers might have serialized the model by saving its weights, architecture, and other relevant information to a file. This allows the model to be easily loaded and deployed on a different platform.
4. Platform Selection: The researchers might have selected a platform for deploying the model, such as a cloud-based server or an edge device like a Raspberry Pi. The choice of platform would depend on the specific requirements of the application, such as latency, throughput, and cost.
5. Model Deployment: Finally, the researchers would have deployed the model on the selected platform, allowing it to make predictions on new data in real-time.

It's important to note that this answer is based on general practices for deep learning model deployment and is not specifically mentioned in the provided context.
