Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. However, the context does provide information about the data sources and methodology used in a study related to land use and land cover (LU/LC) in Israel.

The study used archaeological survey data from the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) and remotely sensed data from spaceborne Vegetation and Environment Moni-toring on a New Micro Satellite (VENÎ¼S), airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for LU/LC analysis. Additional ancillary data was required for establishing research control, georeferencing, and masking disturbed areas.

However, the context does not mention any details about the deep learning model used in the study, such as the type of model, the training data, or the process followed to deploy the trained model. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query based on the provided context.

It is important to note that deploying a deep learning model involves several steps, including model serialization, platform selection, and model deployment. Model serialization involves saving the trained model in a format that can be loaded and used for making predictions. Platform selection involves choosing the hardware and software platform where the model will be deployed. Model deployment involves loading the serialized model onto the selected platform and configuring it for making predictions.

Without more information about the specific deep learning model used in the study, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to the query. Therefore, the answer to the query is:


The provided context does not contain information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
