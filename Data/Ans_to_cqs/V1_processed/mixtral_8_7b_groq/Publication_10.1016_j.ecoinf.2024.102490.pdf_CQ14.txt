The provided pieces of context do not contain specific information on how the hyperparameters of a model are optimized in the studies mentioned. Hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in machine learning model development, and various methods such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and more recently, evolutionary algorithms, are used to find the optimal set of hyperparameters.

Grid search involves creating a grid of hyperparameter values and training the model with each combination, selecting the best set of hyperparameters based on a performance metric. Random search, on the other hand, involves randomly selecting hyperparameter values from a defined range and training the model with each combination. Random search has been shown to perform as well as grid search while being more efficient.

Bayesian optimization is a more sophisticated method that uses a probabilistic model to guide the search for optimal hyperparameters. It has been shown to perform better than grid search and random search in some cases. Evolutionary algorithms are a class of optimization algorithms inspired by biological evolution, such as genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization. These algorithms have been used in recent years for hyperparameter optimization and have shown promising results.

In the context of ecological niche modeling and species distribution modeling, hyperparameter optimization is crucial for obtaining accurate predictions. The Cobos et al. (2019) study analyzed heuristic methods for variable selection in ecological niche modeling and species distribution modeling, but it did not mention hyperparameter optimization. Similarly, the Colombo and Joly (2010) study on the performance of predictive distribution models in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest did not mention hyperparameter optimization.

In conclusion, the provided pieces of context do not contain specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. Grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms are some of the commonly used methods for hyperparameter optimization. Hyperparameter optimization is crucial for obtaining accurate predictions in ecological niche modeling and species distribution modeling.
