Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models. However, it is mentioned that data augmentation techniques such as rotation, noise, and flip were used to augment the dataset by six times. This was done to make the CNN classification more robust and to help it generalize better. Therefore, it can be inferred that data augmentation was one of the preprocessing steps. Additionally, it can be assumed that other common preprocessing steps such as normalization or scaling may have been applied, but this information is not provided in the context.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by creating modified versions of the images in the dataset. This can help improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. In this case, the authors used rotation, noise, and flip to augment the dataset by six times. Rotation involves rotating the image by a certain angle, noise involves adding random noise to the image, and flip involves flipping the image horizontally or vertically.

Normalization and scaling are other common preprocessing steps that are often used in deep learning. Normalization involves scaling the pixel values of the image to a range between 0 and 1. This can help improve the training speed and the final performance of the model. Scaling involves resizing the images to a consistent size, which can also help improve the training speed and performance of the model.

In summary, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that data augmentation was one of the preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models. Other common preprocessing steps such as normalization or scaling may have also been applied, but this information is not provided in the context.
