The type of deep learning models used in the pipeline, as described in the given context, are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM).

In the first approach, pre-trained deep neural networks such as EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3 are used, all of which are CNNs. These models are used for image-based tasks and have been pre-trained on the ImageNet database.

In the third approach, six combination models of 3-layer sequence neural networks are developed using LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM. These models are used to predict the traceability of bivalves using PCA-NCA-selected bivalve features as inputs.

Therefore, both CNNs and RNNs are used in the pipeline, depending on the specific task and requirements. CNNs are used for image-based tasks, while RNNs are used for sequence-based tasks.
