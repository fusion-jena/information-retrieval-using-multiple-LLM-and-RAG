The provided context does not specifically mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does mention Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Standard Deviation, which are commonly used to evaluate regression models, but not specifically deep learning models.

In general, for deep learning models, the following metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance:

1. Accuracy: It is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. It is a common metric for classification problems.
2. Precision: It is the ratio of true positive predictions (relevant items that are correctly identified) to the total predicted positives (all items that are identified as relevant).
3. Recall: It is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives (all relevant items).
4. F1-score: It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It tries to find the balance between precision and recall.
5. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): It is the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
6. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): It is the square root of the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.
7. Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (MSLE): It is the mean of the squared differences between the logarithm of predicted and actual values.
8. Explained Variance Score: It measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that is predictable from the input features.
9. Coefficient of Determination (R²): It measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

The choice of evaluation metric depends on the problem at hand, the data available, and the business objective. For example, for a binary classification problem, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are commonly used, while for a regression problem, MAE, RMSE, MSLE, Explained Variance Score, and R² are commonly used.
