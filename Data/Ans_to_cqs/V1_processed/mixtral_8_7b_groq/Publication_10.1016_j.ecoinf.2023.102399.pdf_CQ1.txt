The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the raw data for the fish biomass estimation system was obtained using underwater stereo cameras.

The system uses a fully automated method to estimate fish biomass based on a deep neural network. The input to the system is an image of fish, which is obtained using underwater stereo cameras. The cameras capture the length and height of the fish body in world coordinates. The distance between the camera and the fish body, as well as the focal length and sensor size of the camera, are also used as inputs.

The use of underwater stereo cameras for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline is not surprising, as cameras are commonly used for collecting image data in computer vision tasks. Stereo cameras, which consist of two or more cameras arranged in a specific configuration, can provide depth information about the objects in the image. This is useful for estimating the size and position of the fish in the image, which are important factors for estimating fish biomass.

It is possible that the raw data used in this study was collected through a dedicated survey or experiment, where the underwater stereo cameras were deployed in a fish farm or other aquatic environment. Alternatively, the raw data may have been obtained from a public dataset or repository. However, the context does not provide enough information to determine this with certainty.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that underwater stereo cameras were used to capture images of fish for the fish biomass estimation system. The raw data may have been collected through a dedicated survey or experiment, or it may have been obtained from a public dataset.
