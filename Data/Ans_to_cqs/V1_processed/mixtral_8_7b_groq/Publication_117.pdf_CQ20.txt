The text provided does not give explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and libraries such as TensorFlow, which suggests the use of GPUs as they are commonly used for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel computations. Additionally, the authors mention the use of pretrained weights from the COCO dataset provided by Redmon & Farhadi (2018), which implies the use of a powerful computational infrastructure for training the model. It is also mentioned that the greatest challenge for implementing these algorithms for bespoke applications is obtaining sufficiently large training datasets, which suggests the use of distributed computing systems for training the model.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of GPUs or other hardware resources, it implies the use of powerful computational infrastructure for training the deep learning model, which is likely to include GPUs for parallel computation.
