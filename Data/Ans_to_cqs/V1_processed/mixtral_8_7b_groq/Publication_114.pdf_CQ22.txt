The performance of the deep learning models used for tree species classification is evaluated using several metrics. These include overall accuracy (OA), user's accuracy (UA), producer's accuracy (PA), and F1-Score. The overall accuracy (OA) is the percentage of correctly classified samples out of the total number of samples. User's accuracy (UA) measures the proportion of correctly classified samples for each tree type out of all the samples that are actually of that tree type. Producer's accuracy (PA) measures the proportion of correctly classified samples for each tree type out of all the samples that were predicted to be of that tree type. The F1-Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, where precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives, and recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance in terms of both overall classification and specific tree type classification.
