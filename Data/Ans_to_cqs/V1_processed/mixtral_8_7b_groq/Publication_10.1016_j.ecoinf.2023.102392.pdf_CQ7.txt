Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it is common practice in machine learning to split the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and make decisions during the model building process, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

In the context of Table 7, which presents the land use/land cover classification accuracy using XGBoost, it can be inferred that the dataset has been split at some point to assess the model's performance. However, the specific criteria or method used for splitting the data are not mentioned.

Furthermore, in the study by Pham et al. (2023), they used the ACO-NFS model to estimate the extent of forest fire in the Bo Trach district, Quang Binh province. Although the data splitting criteria are not specified, they might have used a similar approach of splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

In summary, while the provided context does not offer explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it is common practice to split the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets. The specific criteria or method used for splitting the data in these studies are not mentioned.
