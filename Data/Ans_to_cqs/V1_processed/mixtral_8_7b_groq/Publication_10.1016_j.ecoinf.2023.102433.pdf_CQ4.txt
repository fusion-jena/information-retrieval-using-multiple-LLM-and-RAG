I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not include information about the data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context focuses on the methods and data handling of the NasaWebServiceAPIProvider class, which is used for accessing and processing satellite data.

Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are typically applied to enrich the training dataset in computer vision tasks. These techniques create modified versions of the original images, increasing the diversity of the training set and helping the model generalize better. However, the context provided here is about data management, not data augmentation in deep learning.

If you have any other questions related to the provided context or data management, I would be happy to help.
