The provided context discusses the use of Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN) to improve object detection in deep learning models, particularly for small objects. However, it does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I will answer the query based on general knowledge of data preprocessing techniques in deep learning.

 In deep learning, data bias can be addressed during preprocessing using various techniques, including stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

1. Stratified splitting: Stratified sampling ensures that the train and test datasets have a similar distribution of labels. In other words, the fraction of samples for each label remains the same in both the train and test datasets. This technique is useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets where some classes have significantly more or fewer samples than others.

2. Oversampling: Oversampling is a technique used to increase the number of samples from the minority class. This can be done by randomly duplicating samples from the minority class or using techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate synthetic samples. Oversampling helps in reducing the bias towards the majority class and improves the model's performance on the minority class.

3. Undersampling: Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the number of samples from the majority class. This can be done by randomly removing samples from the majority class. However, this technique may result in loss of information and should be used carefully.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting diverse data is crucial in reducing data bias. Diverse data includes data from different sources, domains, and distributions. Collecting diverse data ensures that the model is exposed to a wide variety of samples, reducing the bias towards specific classes or features.

In summary, data bias can be addressed during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline using techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These techniques help in reducing the bias towards specific classes or features and improve the model's performance on imbalanced datasets.
