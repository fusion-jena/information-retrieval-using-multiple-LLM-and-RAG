Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the models was evaluated by comparing the classification success rates of the training, validation, and test sets. This was done for both the full species discrimination model and the simpler sex discrimination model. The full species discrimination model had near perfect classification success, misclassifying only 1 out of 532 tracks. The simple sex discrimination model, based on a single variable, had a species classification success of over 99%, misclassifying 4 out of 532 tracks. The text mentions that there was some slight increase in misclassification for the training and validation sets, but a modest improvement in the test set for the simple sex discrimination model. Therefore, it can be inferred that the performance of the models was monitored by comparing the classification success rates of the training, validation, and test sets.
