The performance of the deep learning model for semantic segmentation used to identify substrate types was evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall.

The overall accuracy of the model was reported to be 92%, indicating that the model correctly classified 92% of the pixels in the test dataset.

Precision, which measures the proportion of true positive predictions (i.e., pixels correctly classified as belonging to a particular class) out of all positive predictions, was calculated for each class. The precision for the vegetation class was 0.90, for the bare class was 0.96, and for the 'other' class was 0.50. These values indicate that the model is highly precise in identifying vegetation and bare substrate pixels, while it is less precise in identifying other class pixels.

Recall, which measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances in the ground truth data, was also calculated for each class. The recall of the model reached 0.97 for vegetation, 0.87 for bare substrate, and 0.53 for the 'other' class. These values indicate that the model has a high recall for vegetation and bare substrate classes, while it has a lower recall for the 'other' class.

These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses in identifying different substrate types. Overall, the model performs well in identifying vegetation and bare substrate pixels, while it has room for improvement in identifying other class pixels.
