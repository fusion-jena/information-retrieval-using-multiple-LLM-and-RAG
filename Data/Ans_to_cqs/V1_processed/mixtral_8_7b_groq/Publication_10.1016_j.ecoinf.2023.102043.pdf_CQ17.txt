The provided context does not give information about the specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline for goat vocalization detection. However, it does mention the use of the YAMNet model, which is a pre-trained model based on the MobileV1 convolution architecture. This model is pre-trained on a large dataset, AudioSet-YouTube, consisting of 521 classes.

Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used techniques to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and less prone to overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that discourages large weights, which can also help to reduce overfitting.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of these regularization techniques, it is possible that they were used during the training of the YAMNet model. Additionally, the authors mention updating the algorithm on a regular basis with new data, which can also help to reduce overfitting by providing the model with more examples to learn from.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline for goat vocalization detection, it is possible that common techniques like dropout and L2 regularization were used during the training of the YAMNet model. The authors also mention updating the algorithm with new data as a way to improve performance and reduce overfitting.
