The deep learning pipeline can utilize various data formats, including images, audio, video, and CSV files, among others. The provided context highlights the use of image datasets in several studies.

For instance, Deng et al. (2009) introduced ImageNet, a large-scale hierarchical image database containing over 14 million high-resolution images across nearly 22,000 categories. This dataset has been widely used for training deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image recognition tasks. He et al. (2015) and He et al. (2016) used ImageNet for training their deep residual learning models, surpassing human-level performance on ImageNet classification.

In addition to static images, video data can also be used in deep learning pipelines. Felleman and Van Essen (1991) studied distributed hierarchical processing in the primate cerebral cortex using neurophysiological data from visual cortical areas, which could be represented as time-series data or video data.

Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, audio and CSV files can also be used in deep learning pipelines. For example, audio data can be used for speech recognition, natural language processing, and music information retrieval tasks. CSV files, which typically contain tabular data, can be used for regression and classification tasks, particularly in the fields of finance, healthcare, and ecology. Christin et al. (2019) discussed applications for deep learning in ecology, which may involve using CSV files containing ecological data.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and CSV files. The provided context primarily focuses on the use of image datasets, but other data formats, such as audio, video, and CSV files, can also be used for training deep learning models.
