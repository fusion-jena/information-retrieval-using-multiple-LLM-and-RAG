The provided context does not specifically mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss a study that uses WT-HMM (Wavelet Transform-Hidden Markov Model) for the detection of North Atlantic Right Whale Up-calls, and it emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate dataset sizes for effective model training.

Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize to new data. Some common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, and scaling. Flipping involves horizontally or vertically flipping the image, rotating involves rotating the image by a certain angle, and scaling involves changing the size of the image. These techniques can help the model learn invariances to certain transformations and prevent overfitting.

In the study by Ibrahim et al. (2018), they used WT-HMM to classify North Atlantic Right Whale Up-calls using varying dataset sizes over 10 runs. They found that the WT-HMM performed superiorly in the 8 to 20-h dataset size range for both months, suggesting the most suitable range for achieving high accuracy. This finding resonates with studies emphasizing the importance of selecting appropriate sample sizes for effective model training.

Therefore, while the provided context does not specifically mention data augmentation techniques, it is still crucial to select an appropriate dataset size for effective model training. Data augmentation techniques can be used to further improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.
