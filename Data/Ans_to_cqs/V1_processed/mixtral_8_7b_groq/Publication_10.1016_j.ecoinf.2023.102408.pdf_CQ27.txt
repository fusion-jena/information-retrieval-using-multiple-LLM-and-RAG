The text provided does not explicitly mention the steps taken to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does discuss the training process of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data for predicting Above Ground Biomass (AGB). 

The ANN model was trained using a stratified sampling method, where 70% of the samples were allocated to the training dataset and the remaining 30% to the validation dataset. The model's performance was evaluated using three error statistics: R2, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). 

The ANN model consists of three layers: input, hidden, and output. The number of units in the hidden layer and the regularization parameter to avoid overfitting were passed as arrays of 1-20 and 0.025-1, respectively. The optimum combination of parameters for the best model fit was based on accuracy. 

However, the text does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other steps taken to deploy the trained model. Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed answer to this query based on the given context.
