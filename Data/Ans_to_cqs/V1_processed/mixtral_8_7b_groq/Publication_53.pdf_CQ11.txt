I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions the use of Python, fastai, and R for developing the deep learning model and conducting statistical analyses, but it does not specify any data repository or code sharing platform used for the project. For more information on the data repository or access to the deep learning pipeline, I would recommend contacting the authors or checking the related publications or project websites.
