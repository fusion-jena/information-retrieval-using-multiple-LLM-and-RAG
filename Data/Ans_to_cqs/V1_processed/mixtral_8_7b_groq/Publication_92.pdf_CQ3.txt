Based on the provided context, the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for coral reef fish detection and recognition in underwater videos are not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that some form of image-level annotation was used during the creation of the training database.

In the data preprocessing stage, the authors worked with biology experts to label many videos and cropped frames of the videos to create a training database composed of 13,000 fish thumbnails (Section 3.1). Each thumbnail contains only one labeled-fish. This suggests that some form of bounding box annotation was used to label the fish within the frames.

Additionally, the authors added a class for the background, which is constituted with random thumbnails of the background and specific background thumbnails taken around the fish thumbnails (Section 3.1). This indicates that some form of background annotation was also performed.

However, the context does not mention any use of instance segmentation or other advanced annotation techniques. It is possible that the authors used a simpler annotation approach due to the challenges posed by the highly textured natural background.

In summary, while the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that some form of bounding box annotation and background annotation were used during the creation of the training database.
