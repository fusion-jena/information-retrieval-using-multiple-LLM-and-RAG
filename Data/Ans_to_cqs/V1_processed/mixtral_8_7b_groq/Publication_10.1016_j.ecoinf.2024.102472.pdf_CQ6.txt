The provided context discusses the training of a Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) for estimating carbon stocks, but it does not explicitly mention specific data preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, based on common practices in training deep learning models, we can infer some possible preprocessing steps.

Before training a deep learning model, data preprocessing is crucial to improve model performance and convergence. Some common preprocessing techniques include:

1. Data cleaning: Removing or correcting erroneous, inconsistent, or missing data points. This step ensures that the model receives high-quality input data.

2. Data scaling: Adjusting the range of input features to a similar scale, often between 0 and 1. Scaling helps the model converge faster and perform better, as it avoids features with larger value ranges dominating the learning process.

3. Data normalization: Transforming data distribution to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Normalization is particularly useful when dealing with features that have different units or distributions.

In the context provided, the authors mention the importance of selecting optimal predictor variables and adjusting node size. These steps can be considered part of the feature engineering process, which is closely related to data preprocessing. Feature engineering involves selecting relevant features, creating new features, and transforming existing features to better capture underlying patterns and improve model performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention specific data preprocessing techniques, it is reasonable to assume that data preprocessing steps like data cleaning, scaling, and normalization were applied before training the MLPNN. Additionally, feature engineering, which includes predictor variable selection and node size adjustment, was also an essential part of the process.
