The pieces of context provided do not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention the use of hyperspectral imagery, Landsat data, and water quality parameters in the context of training machine learning models for water quality assessment.

Hyperspectral imagery is a remote sensing technology that captures detailed information about the reflectance of light across a wide range of wavelengths (Hong et al., 2022). This technology can be used to collect data on water quality parameters such as chlorophyll-a, total suspended solids, and Secchi disk depth (Hong et al., 2022; Jargal et al., 2023).

Landsat data is a type of satellite imagery that provides multispectral data with a spatial resolution of 30 meters (Irons et al., 2012). This data can be used to derive various water quality parameters, such as turbidity and chlorophyll-a concentration (Hwang et al., 2003).

Water quality parameters can also be collected through in-situ measurements using sensors and surveys. For example, Hwang et al. (2003) collected water samples from Korean reservoirs to measure water quality parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient concentrations.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for water quality assessment may include hyperspectral imagery, Landsat data, in-situ measurements using sensors, and surveys. However, the specific methods used may vary depending on the application and availability of data.
