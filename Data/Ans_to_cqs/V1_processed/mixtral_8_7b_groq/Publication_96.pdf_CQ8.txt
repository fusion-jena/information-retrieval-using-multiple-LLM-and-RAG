The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text describes the methodology and results of a study that developed a semi-automatic method for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome in Brazil using Deep Learning techniques available on Google Cloud computing and Landsat 8 imagery. However, it does not mention where the code for the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
