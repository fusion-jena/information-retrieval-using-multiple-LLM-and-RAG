The provided context does not discuss specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of data from sensors in the context of event-stream processing and edge computing.

In the context of edge computing, it is mentioned that processing power is used close to the sensor to stream data to the network. This suggests that the raw data is collected using sensors. Additionally, it is mentioned that reducing the amount of data at the edge of the cluster, where data streams are transformed to event streams, could also happen at the sensor given sufficient processing power. This implies that sensors play a crucial role in collecting raw data for deep learning pipelines that involve edge computing and event-stream processing.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of public datasets in the context of deep learning, specifically in the paper "Deep Learning with Theano, Torch, Caffe, Tensorflow, and deeplearning4j: Which One Is the Best in Speed and Accuracy?" by Kovalev et al. (2016). However, the context does not provide details on the specific public datasets used.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of surveys for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines, it does mention the use of sensors for collecting data in the context of edge computing and event-stream processing. Additionally, the context suggests the use of public datasets in deep learning, although it does not provide specific details.
