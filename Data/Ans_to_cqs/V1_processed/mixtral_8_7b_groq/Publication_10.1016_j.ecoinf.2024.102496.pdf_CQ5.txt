The provided context does not include information about deep learning pipelines or datasets commonly used in deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context focuses on environmental protection, green infrastructure, water management, and geographic datasets.

The sources mention several datasets and tools related to environmental studies and water management:

1. Introduction to a Natural Treasure: This document from the US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) provides an introduction to a river and lagoon system, discussing its ecological and economic importance. However, it does not mention any datasets.
2. Overcoming Barriers to Green Infrastructure: This USEPA resource discusses the challenges and solutions for implementing green infrastructure. It does not mention any datasets directly but refers to the Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) in the context of water rights.
3. Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD): This dataset from the US Geological Survey (USGS) provides hydrological boundaries for watersheds. It can be used for water management and environmental studies.
4. Examining environmental injustice in Florida: This study by Vaz and Wasserman (2015) examines environmental injustice in Florida but does not mention any specific datasets.
5. Assessing the environmental justice consequences of flood risk: This study by Montgomery and Chakraborty (2015) investigates the environmental justice implications of flood risk in Miami, Florida. It does not mention any specific datasets.
6. Venkataramanan et al. (2015): This study by Venkataramanan et al. (2015) evaluates the environmental consequences of flood risk in Miami, Florida. It does not mention any specific datasets.

Based on the provided context, there is no information about datasets used in deep learning pipelines.
