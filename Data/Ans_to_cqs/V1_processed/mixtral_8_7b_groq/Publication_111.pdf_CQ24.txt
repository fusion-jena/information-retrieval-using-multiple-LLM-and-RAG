The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models, specifically Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), for predicting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH) in marine data. However, it does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value.

In general, deep learning models, like other machine learning algorithms, can be affected by randomness during various stages of the pipeline, such as data preprocessing, model initialization, and evaluation. To address this, practitioners may employ strategies such as setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results, especially during model training.

In the context of the GRU model used for SST and SWH prediction, the randomness could come from the initialization of the model's weights and biases, as well as the shuffling of the input dataset during training. While the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, it is still a common practice to set a fixed seed value in such scenarios to ensure reproducibility of the results.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is still a crucial aspect of deep learning model development. Strategies such as setting a fixed random seed value can help ensure reproducibility and reliability of the model training process.
