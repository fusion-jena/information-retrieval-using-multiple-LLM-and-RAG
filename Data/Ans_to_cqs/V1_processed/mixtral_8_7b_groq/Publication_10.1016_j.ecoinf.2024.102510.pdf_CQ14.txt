In the study, the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a hybrid approach, referred to as the Hybrid Hyperparameter Optimization Scheme (HHOS). This method combines manual and random search techniques sequentially to optimize model performance.

In the initial stage, the HHOS employs a manual search strategy. This approach involves identifying optimal hyperparameter values and narrowing down the search space. The manual search is carried out by selecting frequently used hyperparameter configurations that have proven effective in related studies. This step aims to reduce the search space by focusing on hyperparameter configurations that are likely to yield good results based on prior knowledge and experience.

Following the manual search, the HHOS utilizes a random search method. In this phase, the algorithm iteratively samples various combinations of hyperparameter values identified in the manual search. The models are then trained with each set of hyperparameters, and the configuration yielding the highest accuracy is identified. The random search approach helps explore the hyperparameter space more broadly, increasing the chances of finding optimal hyperparameters.

While the HHOS method effectively combines manual and random searches, it does have some limitations. The manual search relies on domain expertise, and its effectiveness depends heavily on the knowledge and insights provided by experts. In some cases, experts may not be able to fully explore the vast hyperparameter space, leading to suboptimal results. Additionally, the random search approach may require a large number of iterations to achieve satisfactory results, increasing computational time and complexity.

The HHOS algorithm used in this study contributes to the field by effectively utilizing transfer learning as a feature extractor and finetuner to train multiple classifiers. The study also highlights the benefits of the HHOS method, such as adaptability to diverse problem domains and enhanced chances of finding optimal hyperparameters. However, it acknowledges the limitations of the approach, including the risk of missing optimal configurations, time and resource requirements depending on iterations, and the need for effective coordination of both methods.

In summary, the hyperparameters of the model in this study are optimized using a hybrid approach that combines manual and random search techniques. This method aims to leverage the strengths of both strategies while mitigating their individual limitations.
