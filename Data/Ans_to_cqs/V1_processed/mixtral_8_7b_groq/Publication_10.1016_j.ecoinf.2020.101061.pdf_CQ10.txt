The provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text mentions the previous work of Weinstein et al. (2019), but it does not provide a link to the code repository. Additionally, it discusses various techniques and studies related to deep learning and remote sensing, but it does not provide any link to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
