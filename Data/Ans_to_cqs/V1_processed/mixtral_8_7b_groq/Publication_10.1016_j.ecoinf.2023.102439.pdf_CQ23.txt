Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, the text does provide information about how the data was partitioned and the statistical metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.

The data was divided into two sets: one for training, consisting of data from 2005 to 2015 with 264 data points, and another for testing and validation, comprising data from 2016 to 2018 with 72 data points. This distribution resulted in a 60% to 40% split between training and validation/testing data.

To assess the model's performance, several statistical metrics were employed, including Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). These metrics help measure the deviation between the predicted EVI (Estimated Vegetation Index) values and the actual observed values, providing insights into the accuracy and predictive capability of the model.

While these measures do not directly address the generalizability of the model, they do provide a foundation for evaluating its performance on unseen data. However, without information on how the data was collected, processed, or pre-handled, it is difficult to determine if a diverse dataset was used or if any other measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.

In summary, the context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Still, it does provide information on data partitioning and performance evaluation metrics, which can indirectly contribute to assessing the model's generalizability.
