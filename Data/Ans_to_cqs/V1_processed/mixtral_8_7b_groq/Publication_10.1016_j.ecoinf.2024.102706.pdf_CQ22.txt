The provided context does not include information about the performance evaluation of a deep learning model. The models evaluated in the study are linear regression, Elastic Net, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine. These are all machine learning models, and no deep learning models are mentioned.

The performance of these machine learning models is evaluated using the R-squared (R2) metric, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Relative Root Mean Square Error (rRMSE). The R2 metric measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. RMSE is the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors), and rRMSE is the RMSE expressed as a percentage of the observed variable's standard deviation.

Additionally, the context provides information about the interquartile range and the minimum and maximum canopy cover for observed and predicted values. However, these are descriptive statistics and not performance evaluation metrics.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the performance evaluation metrics of a deep learning model.
