The provided context does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the study uses visual spectrogram representations of foreground species recordings to extract features for training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 

In the context, there is no explicit mention of techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. These techniques are often used in computer vision tasks for object detection and semantic segmentation, respectively. 

However, the context does mention the use of Librosa library for data pre-processing, which is commonly used for audio processing tasks, including feature extraction from audio files. This suggests that the data annotation techniques used in this study might be specific to audio data rather than visual data.

In summary, while the provided context does not give explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it suggests that the techniques used might be specific to audio data processing.
