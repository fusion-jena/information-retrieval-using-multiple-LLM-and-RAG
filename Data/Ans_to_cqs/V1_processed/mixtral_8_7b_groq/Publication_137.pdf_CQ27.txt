Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific steps taken to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer some possible steps based on common practices in deep learning model deployment.



The process of deploying the trained deep learning model likely involved several steps. First, the model training was conducted using a deep neural network, where the learning decay rate was set to 0.7 to gradually decrease the learning rate as training progressed. The voxel size and batch size were fixed, and the regularization strength was adjusted to obtain the best results. This training process resulted in a classifier for prediction.

Once the training was complete, the model was likely serialized, which involves saving the model's architecture, weights, and other relevant information into a file format that can be easily loaded and used for making predictions. Common serialization formats include HDF5, JSON, and Protocol Buffers.

After serialization, the platform for deployment was selected. Depending on the intended use case, the platform could range from a local machine to a cloud-based infrastructure. The context does not provide information on the specific platform used.

To use the model for making predictions, the serialized model file would be loaded into the chosen deployment platform. The input point cloud test set would then be segmented, and the final segmentation results would be obtained. These results would include point cloud geometric partition graphs, SPGs, and segmentation results.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly provide information on the deployment process, it is possible to infer that the trained deep learning model underwent serialization and was deployed on a selected platform for generating segmentation results from point cloud test sets.
