The research study "Intertwined impacts of urbanization and land cover change on urban climate and agriculture in Aurangabad city (MS), India using google earth engine platform" utilized the Google Earth Engine platform to collect and analyze data. The Google Earth Engine platform is a powerful tool for processing and analyzing large Earth observation datasets (J. Clean. Prod. 422, 138541).

In the study "Estimating biomass of savanna grasslands as a proxy of carbon stock using multispectral remote sensing", Chapungu, Nhamo, and Gatti (2020) used multispectral remote sensing data to estimate biomass of savanna grasslands. Remote sensing is the acquisition of information about the Earth's surface using electromagnetic radiation, which can be collected by sensors on satellites or aircraft.

Chen et al. (2005) used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data in their study "Spatial and temporal variation of phenological growing season and climate change impacts in temperate eastern China". NDVI is a measure of vegetation health and is calculated from remote sensing data. The NDVI data used in the study were generated from AVHRR sensors by the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Studies (GIMMS).

In the study "Assessment of terrestrial ecosystem sensitivity to climate change in arid, semi-arid, sub-humid, and humid regions using EVI, LAI, and SIF products", Chen et al. (2024) used several remote sensing products, including the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Solar-Induced Fluorescence (SIF) products. These products provide information about vegetation health, leaf area, and photosynthesis, respectively.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the research studies utilized remote sensing data and products collected by sensors on satellites or aircraft to collect raw data. These data are then processed and analyzed using various methods and tools, including the Google Earth Engine platform and statistical analysis techniques.
