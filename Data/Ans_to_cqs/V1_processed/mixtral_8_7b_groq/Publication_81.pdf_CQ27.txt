Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer that the model was likely serialized and then integrated into a software application or tool for further use.

In the context of reference number 40, the authors mention using Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) for classifying fish species based on DNA barcode sequences. They propose a three-stage process for this classification: (1) preprocessing the original data from DNA barcode sequences, (2) using EN-SAE to learn deep features and obtain outgroup scores for each fish, and (3) using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to select a threshold based on the outgroup scores and classify fish from different families.

Assuming that the authors followed standard deep learning practices, they likely serialized the trained EN-SAE model after it was trained and evaluated. Model serialization involves saving the model's architecture, weights, and other relevant information to a file, allowing it to be loaded and used in a different software environment.

Once the model was serialized, the authors could integrate it into a software application or tool for further use. This could involve using a programming language such as Python or R to load the serialized model and apply it to new DNA barcode sequences for classification.

As for platform selection, the context does not provide enough information to determine which platform was used to deploy the model. However, given that the authors used Python for their analysis (as evidenced by the use of libraries such as NumPy and scikit-learn), it is possible that they deployed the model on a Python-based platform such as a Jupyter notebook or a web application using a framework such as Flask or Django.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, we can infer that the model was likely serialized and integrated into a software application or tool for further use. The platform used for deployment is not specified in the context.
