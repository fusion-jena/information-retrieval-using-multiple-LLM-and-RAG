The provided context does not give specific details about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that a diverse, long-term passive acoustic dataset was used in the study. This suggests that diverse data collection may have been employed to reduce data bias.

In the context, the authors discuss the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for automated detection of humpback whale songs. They mention that they used a training library of 8 k and 12 k to demonstrate higher accuracy for the one built using a smaller training dataset. This could potentially indicate the use of undersampling or stratified splitting to address data bias. However, the context does not explicitly confirm this.

The authors also mention that they used transfer learning, which involves using a pre-trained model as a starting point for training a new model on a different dataset. This technique can help reduce data bias by leveraging the knowledge gained from a larger, more diverse dataset to improve the performance of a model trained on a smaller, potentially biased dataset.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, it does suggest that diverse data collection and transfer learning may have been employed. Additionally, the use of a smaller training dataset and potential undersampling or stratified splitting are also possible techniques that may have been used to reduce data bias.
