The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses the application of machine learning models in water quality prediction, which typically involves numerical and statistical data.

In the context, several machine learning models are mentioned, such as SVM (Support Vector Machines), RF (Random Forest), XGB (Extreme Gradient Boosting), ANN (Artificial Neural Networks), and ensemble models. These models are commonly used with tabular data, typically stored in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format or similar formats like Excel or text files.

The context also mentions the Lazy Predict library, which offers 40 ML models. While the library supports various models, it does not specify the data formats it works with. Generally, Python libraries like Lazy Predict can handle different data formats, including CSV, JSON, and others, as long as the data is properly preprocessed and structured for the chosen model.

In summary, based on the provided context, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline for water quality prediction are likely to be tabular data formats, such as CSV. However, the context does not explicitly mention the data formats, so it's possible that other data formats could be used depending on the specific application and requirements of the deep learning pipeline.
