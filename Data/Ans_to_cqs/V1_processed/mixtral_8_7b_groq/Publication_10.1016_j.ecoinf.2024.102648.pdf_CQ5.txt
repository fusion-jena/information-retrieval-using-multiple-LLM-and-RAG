The provided context does not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for predicting Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD) in upland cotton. However, it does mention that image analysis with machine learning, deep learning, and model combination techniques have been used to identify, monitor, and estimate plant disease severity under field conditions.

In general, the datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines for computer vision tasks include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of which is a 28x28 grayscale image associated with a label between 0 and 9. CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are datasets of natural images, which contain 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of which is a 32x32 color image associated with a label from 10 and 100 classes, respectively. ImageNet is a large-scale dataset of natural images, which contains over 14 million images associated with 21,841 classes.

Therefore, while the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for predicting CLCuD in upland cotton are not mentioned, it is likely that a similar dataset of cotton leaf images with corresponding disease severity labels was used.
