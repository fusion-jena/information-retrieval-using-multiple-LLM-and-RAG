Based on the provided context, there are no specific details about post-processing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix. However, there is information about the calculation of certain metrics after model training.

The YOLOv5n model, which is used for the real-time detection of free-swimming orthogonal fish bodies, has been trained and evaluated. After training, several metrics have been calculated to assess the model's performance. These metrics include Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Relative Error (MRE), and R-squared (R2). 

RMSE is a standard way to measure the error of a model in predicting quantitative data. In this case, it is used to measure the difference between the actual and predicted body weight of the fish. MRE, on the other hand, is the average of the relative errors. It provides a percentage representation of the error, making it easier to understand the model's accuracy. R2 is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. It indicates the goodness of fit of the model.

Additionally, the standard deviation of the estimated weight has been provided. This could be considered as a measure of the spread of the estimated weights, giving an idea about the consistency of the model's predictions.

Therefore, while there is no explicit mention of saliency maps or confusion matrix, the context does provide information about the calculation of RMSE, MRE, and R2, as well as the standard deviation of the estimated weight.
