The paper titled "Land Use Suitability Evaluation of Poyang Lake Based on Deep Learning" published in Remote Sensing in 2020 describes several measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.

Firstly, the authors used a diverse dataset for training and testing the model. The input data consists of 40-dimensional data, and the distribution of the training data is normalized using batch normalization due to the large time span and land area. The normalization process involves calculating the mean and variance of each channel in the current batch and then normalizing the input using these values. This helps to reduce internal covariate shift and improve the generalizability of the model.

Secondly, the authors used the 10-fold cross-validation method to divide the training and validation set into ten parts. In this method, nine parts are used as a training set, and one part is used for validation. This process is repeated ten times, and the mean value of the ten results is used to estimate the accuracy of the model. Cross-validation helps to reduce overfitting and improves the generalizability of the model.

Thirdly, the authors addressed the issue of imbalanced categorical data in the training process. Since there are different numbers of samples of the five types of land use suitability samples in the training data, a relatively large weight is generated for the categories that have fewer samples, and a small weight is generated for the categories that have more samples. This helps to improve the performance of the model for the categories that have small sample sizes.

Lastly, the authors used a testing set to evaluate the generalization ability of the final model. The testing set consists of data from a certain year, and it cannot be used as a basis for algorithm-related selection such as parameter tuning and selection of features.

Therefore, the authors have taken several measures to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, including using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, addressing imbalanced categorical data, and using a testing set.
