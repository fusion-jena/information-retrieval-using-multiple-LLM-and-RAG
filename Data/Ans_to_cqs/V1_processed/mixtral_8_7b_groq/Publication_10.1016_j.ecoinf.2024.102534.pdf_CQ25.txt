Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating that a deep learning model was used in this study. Instead, an ensemble model incorporating Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) components was used to predict current and future suitable areas of orchids under land cover and climate change. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query regarding the purpose of a deep learning model in this context.
