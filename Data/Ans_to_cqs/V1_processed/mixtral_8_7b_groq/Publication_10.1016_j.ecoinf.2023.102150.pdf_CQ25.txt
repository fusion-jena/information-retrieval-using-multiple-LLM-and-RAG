The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is animal detection and classification in camera trap images. This is evident from the use of deep neural networks, which have been successful in image recognition tasks and animal detection and classification (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Norouzzadeh et al., 2018; Tabak et al., 2019; Willi et al., 2019; Zualkernan et al., 2022). The model is specifically trained to separate empty images from those containing an animal, identify species, count individuals, and categorize animal behavior (Norouzzadeh et al., 2018).

The deep learning model is implemented in R using the keras package, an interface to TensorFlow (Abadi et al., 2015; Chollet et al., 2017). The ResNet50 architecture is used with an adam optimizer (He et al., 2016; Kingma and Ba, 2014). The model is trained from scratch for 55 epochs.

The use of R for implementing the deep learning model is significant as it is a programming language widely used by ecologists (Lai et al., 2019). This lowers the threshold for ecologists to implement automatic image classification in their workflows.

In summary, the deep learning model is designed for animal detection and classification in camera trap images, specifically to separate empty images from those containing an animal, identify species, count individuals, and categorize animal behavior. The implementation in R makes it accessible to ecologists for use in their research.
