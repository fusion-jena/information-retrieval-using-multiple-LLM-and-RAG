The provided context discusses the use of deep learning techniques for image enhancement, specifically underwater image enhancement, but it does not directly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge of deep learning practices, I can provide a suitable answer.


In deep learning pipelines, regularization methods are essential to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model learns the training data too well, to the point where it performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization techniques help maintain the model's generalization capability. Common regularization methods include dropout, L1 regularization, and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, preventing the model from relying too heavily on specific neurons. This leads to a more robust and generalized model.

L1 and L2 regularization, also known as Lasso and Ridge regression, respectively, work by adding a penalty term to the loss function. L1 regularization adds the absolute value of the weights as a penalty, encouraging sparse weight values. L2 regularization adds the square of the weights as a penalty, promoting smaller weight values. These methods help prevent overfitting by discouraging large weight values and reducing the complexity of the model.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these regularization techniques, they are widely used in deep learning applications, including image enhancement tasks, to maintain model generalization and prevent overfitting.
