Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. The text describes the methods used for image processing and classification of aerial imagery, but it does not specify the use of any standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

In the described process, the 2009 NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program) imagery and historical imagery were used. For the 2009 NAIP imagery, a per-pixel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) layer was calculated and used in segmentation, along with the red, green, and blue (RGB) bands and the near-infrared (NIR) band. For historical imagery, image brightness and six GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix) texture measures were used.

The text also mentions the use of eCognition rule sets for image processing, but it does not provide enough information to identify the specific datasets used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not known.
