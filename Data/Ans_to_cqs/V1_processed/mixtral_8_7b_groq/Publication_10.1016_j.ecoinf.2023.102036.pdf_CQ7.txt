The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, as described in the provided context, involves a training set and a validation set. However, there is no explicit mention of a separate test set.

During the model training process, the data is divided into iterations, with each iteration consisting of 3000 training steps. In each of these steps, a batch of 100 images is used, where each batch contains a pair of similar and a pair of dissimilar photos. This means that the model is trained on 25 images at a time, and each image is used in four different comparisons (similar and dissimilar to the other three images in the batch).

The performance of the model is then evaluated every 300 iterations, using a validation set. This allows the team to monitor the model's progress and make adjustments to the training parameters as needed.

It's worth noting that there is no explicit mention of a separate test set. A test set is typically used to evaluate the final performance of the model, after training and validation are complete. The absence of a test set in the described process could be a limitation, as it may not provide a completely unbiased estimate of the model's performance on new, unseen data.

In summary, the data is split for deep learning model training in the provided context using a training set and a validation set, with the model's performance evaluated on the validation set every 300 iterations. However, there is no explicit mention of a separate test set, which could be a limitation.
