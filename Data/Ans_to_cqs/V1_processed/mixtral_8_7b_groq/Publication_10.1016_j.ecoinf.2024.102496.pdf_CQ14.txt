Based on the provided context, there is no information about the optimization of hyperparameters for a model, such as grid search or random search. The text focuses on describing a tool that provides an overview of various Best Management Practices (BMPs) for reducing pollutant loads in water bodies.

The tool includes features such as zooming in and out, searching for a location, accessing pollutant loads and environmental justice metrics before and after BMP implementation, and selecting different basemaps. The tool highlights locations with higher pollutant loads and less favorable social vulnerability index conditions, allowing users to access comprehensive information about corresponding census tract and watershed attributes.

However, the text does not mention any details about the optimization of hyperparameters for a model. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
