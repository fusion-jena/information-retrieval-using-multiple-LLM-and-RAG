Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, the text does provide details about how the model's performance is evaluated in general.

The model's performance is evaluated by comparing the Q values of different drivers at various spatial scales. The 90% quartiles of the Q values for all drivers are compared at grid scales of 1 km*1 km, 2 km*2 km, 3 km*3 km, 4 km*4 km, 5 km*5 km, and 6 km*6 km. The optimal sampling grid is then selected based on the criterion that the 90% quartile is the largest. This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated by comparing the explanatory power of each driver at different spatial scales and selecting the scale that provides the best explanation.

Furthermore, the kNDVI trends are categorized into four types based on the slope and significance of the trends. This categorization helps in understanding the vegetation improvement or degradation trend, which is another way of evaluating the model's performance.

However, the text does not mention any strategy to monitor the model's performance during the training phase. Therefore, it can be said that there is no information available in the provided context about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
