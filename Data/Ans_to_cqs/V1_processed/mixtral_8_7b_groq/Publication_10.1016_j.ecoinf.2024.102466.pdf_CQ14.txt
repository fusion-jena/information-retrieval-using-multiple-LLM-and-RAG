Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. The text focuses on the evaluation of the Cascade RCNN model and other models for wild bird recognition, as well as the impact of factors like noise and environmental clutter on the algorithm's performance. It also mentions the use of different pixel size ranges (APs, APm, APl) for the metric area in the dataset. However, it does not provide information on the specific hyperparameter optimization techniques used. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional context.
