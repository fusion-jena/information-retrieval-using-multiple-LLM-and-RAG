The provided context does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that an annotation tool was used to save annotations as XML files in PASCAL VOC format. The PASCAL VOC format supports several types of annotations, including bounding boxes, which specify the location and extent of objects in an image.

It is likely that bounding box annotations were used in this study, as they are a common and widely-used annotation technique for object detection tasks. Bounding box annotations involve drawing a rectangle around an object in an image, with the coordinates of the rectangle indicating the location and size of the object. This type of annotation is relatively quick and easy to create, making it a practical choice for large-scale annotation efforts.

The context also mentions that the study evaluated the transferability and generalization capacity of both classification and object detection CNNs when applied to social media images. Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within an image, and it typically requires bounding box annotations. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that bounding box annotations were used in this study for the object detection component of the deep learning pipeline.

The context does not mention any other types of annotations, such as instance segmentation, which involves creating a mask around each instance of an object in an image. Instance segmentation can provide more precise object boundaries than bounding box annotations, but it is generally more time-consuming and labor-intensive to create.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that bounding box annotations were used for object detection tasks.
