Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipelines are not mentioned. The context focuses on various applications of deep learning techniques in the field of ecology, such as streamflow forecasting, water resources management, air quality prediction, and biological early warning systems. However, it does not specify the datasets used in these studies.

In general, deep learning models can be trained on various types of datasets, depending on the specific task and application. Some popular datasets used in deep learning research include:

1. MNIST: A dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for image classification tasks.
2. CIFAR: A collection of image datasets, used for object recognition and image classification tasks.
3. ImageNet: A large-scale dataset of images, used for various visual recognition tasks.
4. UCI Machine Learning Repository: A collection of datasets for machine learning tasks, including regression, classification, and clustering.
5. Kaggle: A platform for predictive modelling and analytics competitions, which provides a wide range of datasets for various applications.

These datasets are widely used in deep learning research, but they may not be directly applicable to the ecological studies mentioned in the context. In ecological studies, researchers often use domain-specific datasets, such as time-series data on water quality, air pollution, or animal behavior. These datasets are typically collected through field observations, experiments, or sensor networks, and they may require preprocessing and cleaning before being used in deep learning models.
