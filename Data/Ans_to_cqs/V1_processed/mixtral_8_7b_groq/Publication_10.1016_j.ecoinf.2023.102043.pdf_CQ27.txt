The text provided does not give specific details about the process of deploying the trained deep learning model after training. However, it does mention that the model used is YAMNet, which is a pre-trained model from the TensorFlow library. TensorFlow provides tools and methods for model serialization, which involves saving the model's architecture, learned weights, and other parameters to a file. This file can then be used for deployment on various platforms.

The text also mentions that the audio data is processed in a specific way to be compatible with YAMNet. This includes converting the audio to a monophonic channel, resampling it at 16 kHz, extracting the spectrogram using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) magnitudes with 25 ms windows overlapped by 15 ms, and calculating the Mel spectrogram by mapping to 64 bins within the range of 125â€“7500 Hz. This processed data is then used as input to the YAMNet model.

As for the platform selection, the text does not provide information on where or how the model is deployed. It could be deployed on a local machine, in the cloud, or on an edge device, depending on the specific requirements of the application. Therefore, while we can infer some steps based on the provided context, the specifics of the model deployment process are not covered in the text.
