Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the optimization of hyperparameters for a model, such as through methods like grid search or random search. The context focuses on topics related to soil information, irrigation, and visualization tools, but it does not mention any model training or hyperparameter optimization processes.

There are some references to models and techniques, such as mixed integer programming for automated metro map generation (Oke and Siddiqui, 2015; Xu et al., 2022; Nollenburg and Wolff, 2011) and pedometric techniques for use in soil survey (McBratney, Odeh, Bishop, Dunbar, and Shatar, 2000). However, these references do not discuss hyperparameter optimization methods.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information about the optimization of hyperparameters for a model.
