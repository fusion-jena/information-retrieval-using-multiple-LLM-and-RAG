The text does not provide specific details about the methods used for data collection in the study. However, it mentions that the data used in the deep learning pipeline for a customized convolutional neural network (CNN) and transfer learning approach consisted of images. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data collection methods likely involved some form of image capture or creation.

The images were created using a two-second window size and 90 dpi (dots per inch) resolution. The smallest dataset consisted of 3900 images. However, the text does not provide information on where these images were obtained or how they were created.

In general, there are several methods that can be used for collecting image data, including:

1. Surveys: Surveys can be conducted to collect images from participants. For example, a survey could ask participants to take pictures of a specific object or scene.
2. Sensors: Sensors can be used to automatically capture images in a specific environment. For example, a camera sensor could be set up to take pictures of animals in a wildlife reserve.
3. Public datasets: Publicly available datasets can be used to obtain image data. These datasets are often created by researchers or organizations and made available for other researchers to use.

Without more information from the text, it is not possible to determine which of these methods was used in the study. However, it is clear that image data was used in the deep learning pipeline for the customized CNN and transfer learning approach.
