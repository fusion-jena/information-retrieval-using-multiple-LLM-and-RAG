The provided context does not directly discuss data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. However, it does mention the use of deep learning models for image classification and detection. Common data annotation techniques used for these tasks include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a rectangle around the object of interest in an image. The coordinates of the rectangle are then used as labels during training. This method is useful for object detection tasks where the goal is to locate the object within the image.

2. Instance segmentation: In this technique, each pixel in the image is labeled according to the object it belongs to. This results in a segmented mask for each instance of an object in the image. Instance segmentation is more precise than bounding box annotation as it provides exact pixel-level information about the object.

3. Semantic segmentation: This technique is similar to instance segmentation but does not differentiate between instances of the same class. Instead, all pixels belonging to the same class are given the same label. Semantic segmentation is useful for tasks where class-level information is sufficient.

4. Classification annotation: This technique involves labeling an image with the class of object it contains. This method is used when the goal is to classify an image into one of several categories.

The context mentions the use of a hybrid network combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViT) for image classification and detection. In such a pipeline, data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation can be used to train the CNN component for local feature extraction. The ViT component can then be trained on the same data using global context information.

For example, in the Cascade CNN-ViT model mentioned in the context, bounding box annotation can be used to train the Inception-V3 and ResNet-50 components for local feature extraction. The ViT component can then be trained on the same data using global context information to improve the performance of the classification network.
