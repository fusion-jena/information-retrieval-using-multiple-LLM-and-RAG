Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context mainly discusses the application of random forest models, a type of machine learning method, for estimating evapotranspiration.

However, it is important to note that optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for optimizing model parameters. These techniques are used to minimize the loss function during training, enabling the model to learn from the data effectively.

In the context, the authors mention using Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter optimization in the random forest method. Bayesian Optimization is a sequential model-based optimization method used for finding the global minimum of a black-box function. It is commonly used for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention any specific optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines, it is important to note that techniques such as SGD and Adam are commonly used for optimizing deep learning models. Additionally, the context mentions the use of Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning in the random forest method.
