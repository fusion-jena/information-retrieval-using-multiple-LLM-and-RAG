The type of deep learning models used in the pipeline mentioned in the context are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This is evident from the description of the study, where it is mentioned that six popular deep learning models were adopted, and these models included InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50, Xception, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, and GoogleNet. All these models are variants of CNNs, which are widely used in computer vision tasks for image classification, object detection, and segmentation. The study also mentions the use of transfer learning, where networks are first trained on a larger dataset like ImageNet and then fine-tuned on a target task with a small dataset. This is a common approach in deep learning for addressing the limitation of small datasets in specific tasks, as mentioned in the context. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning models used in the pipeline are CNNs.
