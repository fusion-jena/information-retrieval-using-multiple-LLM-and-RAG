The data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context is image data. The images are drawn from a three-month span across three environments, with multi-temporal data incorporated to triple the image pool for each transect. These images are then preprocessed and organized into 18 folders, one for each of the 450 m transects. The preprocessing includes automatic data augmentation in fast.ai and normalization using the ImageNet statistics, which involves resizing the images to 224 Ã— 224 pixels. The normalized image data is then used to train and test deep learning models using the ResNet-34 architecture inside the fast.ai framework. Therefore, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image data.
