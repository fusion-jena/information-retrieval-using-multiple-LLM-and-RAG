I don't have enough information to provide a detailed answer to this query. The provided context includes details about the authors' contributions, data availability, and references, but it does not include any details about the deployment of a deep learning model.

However, I can provide some general information about the process that is typically followed to deploy a trained deep learning model.

First, the model is typically saved or serialized, which involves converting the model's architecture and weights into a format that can be easily loaded and used later. This can be done using various model serialization libraries, such as TensorFlow's `tf.saved_model` or PyTorch's `torch.save`.

Next, a platform is selected for deploying the model. This could be a local machine, a cloud-based platform, or an edge device. The choice of platform depends on various factors, such as the model's size, the required latency, and the available resources.

Once the platform is selected, the model is loaded and integrated into the desired application. This may involve optimizing the model for the target platform, such as by quantizing the model's weights or using techniques like model pruning or distillation.

Finally, the model is deployed and monitored to ensure that it is performing as expected. This may involve setting up logging and monitoring systems to track the model's performance and identify any issues that may arise.

Again, I want to emphasize that the provided context does not include any specific details about the deployment of a deep learning model. Therefore, this answer is based on general best practices and may not reflect the actual process that was followed in this case.
