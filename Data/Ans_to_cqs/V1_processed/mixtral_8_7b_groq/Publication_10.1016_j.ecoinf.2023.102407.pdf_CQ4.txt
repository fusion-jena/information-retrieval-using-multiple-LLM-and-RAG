Based on the provided context, the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for training species distribution models (SDMs) are not explicitly mentioned. The text only states that "data augmentation" is used to improve the accuracy of the initial teacher model, which is then used to improve the accuracy of the student model.

However, common data augmentation techniques for image data in deep learning include flipping, rotating, and scaling. Flipping involves creating new images by horizontally or vertically flipping the original image. Rotating involves creating new images by rotating the original image by a certain angle. Scaling involves creating new images by changing the size of the original image.

In the context of SDMs, data augmentation could involve creating new data points by applying transformations to the existing observation data. For example, if the observation data consists of geographical coordinates and species labels, data augmentation could involve creating new data points by shifting or jittering the coordinates within a certain range.

The specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for SDMs may depend on the characteristics of the observation data and the specific requirements of the SDMs. The text mentions that the teacher model is initially trained using only deep learning with a small amount of observation data, and that the data augmentation is performed by retraining the teacher model using augmented data and generating pseudo-labels for unlabeled data.

Additionally, the text mentions that the study area is divided into training, validation, and test sets for MaxEnt and the hyperparameters are set up as in Bean et al. (2012). However, the specific details of the data splitting and hyperparameter tuning are not provided in the context.

Therefore, while the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for SDMs are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, common data augmentation techniques for image data in deep learning include flipping, rotating, and scaling. In the context of SDMs, data augmentation could involve creating new data points by applying transformations to the existing observation data.
