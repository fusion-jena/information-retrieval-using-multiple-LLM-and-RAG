Data augmentation techniques are used to increase the diversity of training data in deep learning pipelines. These techniques create new training examples by applying transformations to the existing data. According to the context provided, the following data augmentation techniques have been applied in deep learning pipelines:

1. Flipping: Flipping is a technique where the image is horizontally or vertically flipped to create a new training example. In the context [1], the model was tested with and without image data augmentation, including several flips for each training image.
2. Rotation: Rotation is a technique where the image is rotated by a certain angle to create a new training example. In the context [1], the augmented data that has been used while training provided a little deeper understanding of the objects to the model and improved the segmentation.
3. Scaling: Scaling is a technique where the image is scaled up or down to create a new training example. However, the provided context does not explicitly mention scaling as a data augmentation technique.

These techniques help to increase the size of the training dataset, reduce overfitting, and improve the generalization of the model. Additionally, data augmentation techniques can also help to make the model more robust to variations in the input data.

Other data augmentation techniques that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Translation: Translation is a technique where the image is translated horizontally or vertically to create a new training example.
2. Cropping: Cropping is a technique where a portion of the image is removed to create a new training example.
3. Color jittering: Color jittering is a technique where the brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue of the image are randomly adjusted to create a new training example.
4. Affine transformations: Affine transformations are a set of transformations that include scaling, rotation, translation, and shearing.

These data augmentation techniques can be applied to various types of deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformers. The choice of data augmentation techniques depends on the specific problem and the type of data available.
