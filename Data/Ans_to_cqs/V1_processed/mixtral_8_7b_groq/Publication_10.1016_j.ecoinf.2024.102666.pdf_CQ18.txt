The provided context does not give specific details about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention some techniques and considerations taken into account when developing and selecting atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms for processing remote sensing data.

One of the mentioned techniques is the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) for atmospheric correction. The efficacy of these algorithms varies across different aquatic environments, and the choice of the algorithm depends on the specific application and scenario. For instance, the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) model, originally developed for land pixels, has proven effective in AC for aquatic environments using Sentinel-2 and SPOT-6 imagery. The FLAASH algorithm mitigates the spatial proximity effect by employing an internal pixel averaging technique, which is essential for attaining high-quality AC.

Moreover, the context highlights the importance of accurate aerosol type understanding for L2gen to obtain high-quality remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) retrieval. The complex aerosols of certain regions, such as the Panama Lake (PL), make this practice less efficient. Therefore, it can be inferred that monitoring the model performance during training may involve evaluating the accuracy of aerosol type classification and its impact on Rrs retrieval.

Furthermore, the context discusses the use of indices to provide a quantitative evaluation of the accuracy of AC algorithms. These indices facilitate the comparison and selection of the most effective algorithms for various applications and scenarios. Hence, monitoring the model performance during training may also involve calculating these indices and comparing the algorithm's performance against other models or benchmarks.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, it does suggest that monitoring the accuracy of aerosol type classification, evaluating the impact of aerosol types on Rrs retrieval, and calculating indices for quantitative evaluation of AC algorithms may be part of the strategy. However, further information is required to provide a more specific answer.
