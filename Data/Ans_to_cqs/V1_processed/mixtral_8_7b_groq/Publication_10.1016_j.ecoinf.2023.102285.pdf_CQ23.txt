The text provided does not give a detailed explanation of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was evaluated using independent datasets in three different phases. In Phase III, the model was tested on a dataset consisting of 57 images with ISMMMOs (man-made underwater objects) and 5000 images with no ISMMMOs. This phase was used to observe if the methodology worked as desired for other independent datasets. After obtaining satisfactory results, the model was further validated by field experts using another independent dataset in Phase IV. This suggests that cross-validation with independent datasets was used to ensure the model's generalizability. However, there is no explicit mention of other measures such as diverse dataset creation or stratified splitting.
