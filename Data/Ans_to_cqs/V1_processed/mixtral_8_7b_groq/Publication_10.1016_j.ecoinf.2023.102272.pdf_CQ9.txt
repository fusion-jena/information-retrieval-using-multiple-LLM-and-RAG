Based on the given context, there is no information provided about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study "Forecasting the abundance of disease vectors with deep learning" by Ceia-Hasse et al. (year not specified). The context includes detailed information about the model selection procedure, the parameters tested, and the performance evaluation, but it does not mention where the data used in the study can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.

However, I would like to point out that the paper "Deep learning and process understanding for data-driven earth system science" by Reichstein et al. (2019) mentions the use of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry's Data Infrastructure (MPI-BGC DIA) for data storage and management. Although this study is not directly related to the query, it suggests that the authors of the deep learning pipeline for mosquito abundance forecasting might have used a similar data infrastructure.

Another possibility is that the data repository is not publicly available due to privacy or ethical concerns, as the study involves the forecasting of disease vectors.

In summary, I cannot provide an answer to the query about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study "Forecasting the abundance of disease vectors with deep learning" by Ceia-Hasse et al. (year not specified). However, I suggest checking the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry's Data Infrastructure (MPI-BGC DIA) or contacting the authors for more information.
