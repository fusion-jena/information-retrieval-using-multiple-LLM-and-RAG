The provided context does not contain information about deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context focuses on the comparison of different methods for intensity prediction and relabelling in ecological informatics, using measures such as sumNIMSE and meanRSS. The methods compared include knn, LoopT, LoopA, LoopE, CoinF, and various mixture models. The context discusses the impact of lasso regularization and bias correction on the performance of these methods, but it does not mention optimization techniques used in deep learning.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query about optimization techniques in deep learning pipelines.
