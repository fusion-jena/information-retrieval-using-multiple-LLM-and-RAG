The provided context does not give specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that the authors used the YOLOv6 model, but it does not specify whether techniques such as dropout, L2 regularization, or others were employed. Furthermore, it mentions that different sets of hyper-parameters were tested, but it does not detail what those hyper-parameters were or if they included regularization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the given context.
