Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the mentioned NasaWebServiceAPIProvider class or the associated methods. The context focuses on the methods and parameters of the NasaWebServiceAPIProvider class, which is a part of the nasawebservice package for accessing NASA's remote sensing data.

However, in the broader context of machine learning and deep learning, training is often considered complete when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly. This means that the model's performance on the validation set has stabilized, and continuing the training process may not improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

In the context of Seide and Amit (2016) discussing CNTK, Microsoft's open-source deep-learning toolkit, they do not explicitly mention the criteria for determining when training is complete. Nonetheless, it can be inferred that similar criteria, such as validation loss plateauing, are used in CNTK and other deep learning frameworks.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the NasaWebServiceAPIProvider class, it is common in machine learning and deep learning to consider training complete when the validation loss plateaus or shows minimal improvement.
