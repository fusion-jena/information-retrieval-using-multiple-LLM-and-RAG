The text provided does not give a comprehensive list of all the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of top-1 classification accuracy as one of the metrics.

Top-1 classification accuracy is a commonly used metric in machine learning, particularly in image classification tasks. It measures the percentage of times that the model's top prediction matches the true label. In other words, it calculates the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions made.

While top-1 accuracy is a useful metric, it does not provide a complete picture of the model's performance. For instance, it does not take into account cases where the true label is among the model's top predictions but not the very first one. To address this limitation, other metrics such as top-5 accuracy are also used.

The text does not mention the use of other metrics like precision, recall, or F1 score. Precision measures the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it provides a balanced assessment of both.

In summary, while the text only explicitly mentions the use of top-1 classification accuracy, other metrics such as top-5 accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are also commonly used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models.
