The text provided discusses a study on animal classification using deep learning and transfer learning techniques. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot directly answer the query based on the given context.

However, I can provide some general techniques used to address data bias in machine learning and deep learning:

1. Stratified sampling: During the splitting of data into training, validation, and testing sets, stratified sampling ensures that each set maintains the original proportion of classes. This method is useful when dealing with highly imbalanced classes.

2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances from the minority class to balance the data. This can be done by duplicating instances or using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), which creates new instances based on the feature space similarities between existing instances.

3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances from the majority class to balance the data. This method can lead to loss of information, so it should be used carefully.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the target population can help reduce data bias.

5. Data augmentation: This technique involves artificially increasing the size of the dataset by applying transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping) to the existing images. This can help improve model performance and reduce overfitting.

6. Class weights: In deep learning models, class weights can be assigned to give higher importance to minority classes during training.

Based on the given context, the researchers mention that they used a 60-20-20 train/validate/test regime for splitting the data but did not apply any balancing techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or class weights during the first stage of their research. They plan to pursue these techniques in a second phase.
