Based on the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is the number of iterations. The training was stopped after 6900 iterations. There is no mention of using validation loss plateau or any other validation metric to determine when to stop the training.

Additionally, the training was stopped after a specific number of iterations because it factors 10 every 69 iterations, and the training was stopped after 100 factors of 10 (6900 iterations). This was done as a part of the experimental setup and not based on the performance of the model on the validation set.

It's worth noting that using a fixed number of iterations to determine when training is complete is not a common practice in deep learning. Typically, training is stopped when the validation loss plateaus or starts to degrade, or when the model starts to overfit. This helps to ensure that the model has learned to generalize well to unseen data. However, in this case, the authors might have had a specific reason to stop training after a fixed number of iterations, which is not clear from the provided context.
