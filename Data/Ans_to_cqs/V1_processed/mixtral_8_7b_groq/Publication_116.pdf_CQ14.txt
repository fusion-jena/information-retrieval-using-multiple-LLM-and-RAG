The text provided does not give specific details about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it does mention several papers and approaches related to the model, one of which is a paper by Simonyan and Zisserman (2014) that introduces a very deep convolutional network for large-scale image recognition. This paper could potentially discuss methods for hyperparameter optimization, but the text provided does not include this information.

The authors do mention that they used a pre-trained deep neural network for their plant identification task, and that they fine-tuned the network on their own dataset. Fine-tuning a pre-trained network involves adjusting some of the hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, but it is not clear whether the authors used a systematic approach like grid search or random search to optimize these hyperparameters.

In the context of the experiments described in the text, the authors created two types of datasets: a biased dataset and an unbiased dataset. They used these datasets to train and test their plant identification model, but they did not mention any hyperparameter optimization methods in this context.

In summary, while the text provides some information about the model and the datasets used for training and testing, it does not give specific details about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized.
