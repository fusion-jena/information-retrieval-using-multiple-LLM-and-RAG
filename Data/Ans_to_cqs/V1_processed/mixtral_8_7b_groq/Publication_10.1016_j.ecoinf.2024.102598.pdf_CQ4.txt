I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not include information about the data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various models used for predicting forest fires, such as data mining techniques, simulation models, machine learning models, and ensemble modeling. However, it does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques. Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning to increase the amount of training data and improve model performance. Flipping involves vertically or horizontally flipping images, while rotating involves rotating images by a certain angle. Scaling changes the size of the images. These techniques can help improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.
