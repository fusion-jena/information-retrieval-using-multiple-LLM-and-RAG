In conclusion, while the context provides information on the selection of the deep learning model, the input module, the backbone module, the header network, and the multiscale feature-extraction network, it does not explicitly mention the steps of model serialization and platform selection. Therefore, the answer is based on the available information, and it can be inferred that the Deep SORT model using FENs was deployed for tracking and identifying Procapra przewalskii using UAV MOT and GMC.
