Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the preprocessing steps applied to the images before training the deep learning models. However, it can be inferred that some preprocessing was performed since the input size of the images was set to 256 Ã— 256. Common preprocessing steps for image data include:

1. Normalization: This process involves scaling the pixel values to a smaller range, often between 0 and 1, to improve the model's training efficiency and stability.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling adjusts the pixel values to a specific range. It can also involve resizing the images to a uniform size, as mentioned in the context.

3. Cleaning: This step may include removing noise, correcting for lighting or color imbalances, and eliminating irrelevant objects or parts of the image that do not contribute to the classification task.

While the context does not explicitly mention these preprocessing steps, it is essential to note that preprocessing is a crucial part of working with image data in deep learning. Researchers often perform these steps to ensure the model can learn and generalize effectively from the data.

In summary, although the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps, it is highly likely that some preprocessing, such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning, was performed on the image data before training the deep learning models.
