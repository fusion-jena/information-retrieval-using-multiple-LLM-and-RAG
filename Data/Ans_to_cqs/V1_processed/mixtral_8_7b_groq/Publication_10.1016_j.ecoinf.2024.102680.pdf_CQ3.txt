The provided context discusses the use of deep learning networks for object detection in underwater images and the limitations of the original YOLOv8 network in capturing accurate feature information. However, it does not directly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for object detection include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a bounding box around the object of interest in an image. The bounding box should be tight enough to enclose the object while excluding the background. This technique is commonly used for object detection tasks where the goal is to locate the object within an image.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves segmenting each instance of an object in an image. It is a more fine-grained approach than bounding box annotation, as it provides a pixel-level mask for each object instance. This technique is commonly used for tasks that require identifying and segmenting multiple instances of the same object in an image.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves segmenting an image into regions based on the object class. It is a coarser-grained approach than instance segmentation, as it does not differentiate between multiple instances of the same object class. This technique is commonly used for tasks that require identifying the dominant object class in an image.

The choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the level of detail required for object detection. For underwater object detection, bounding box annotation may be sufficient for locating objects within an image, while instance segmentation may be required for identifying and segmenting multiple instances of the same object.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, common techniques include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. The choice of technique depends on the specific task and the level of detail required for object detection.
