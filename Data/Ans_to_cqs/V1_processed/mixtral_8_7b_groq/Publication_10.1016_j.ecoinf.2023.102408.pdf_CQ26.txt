The provided text discusses the use of a stratified sampling method for evaluating the performance of a machine learning model, but it does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does touch upon some related concepts that are often used in addressing data bias, such as stratified sampling and oversampling/undersampling.

Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures each subset (or "stratum") of the population is proportionally represented in the sample. This technique can help ensure that the training and validation datasets are representative of the entire population, reducing the risk of bias.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to address class imbalance, a common form of data bias. Class imbalance occurs when one class (e.g., positive outcomes) is overrepresented in the dataset relative to another class (e.g., negative outcomes). Oversampling involves creating more instances of the underrepresented class, while undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of the overrepresented class. These techniques can help improve the performance of machine learning models by ensuring that they are exposed to a more balanced set of examples during training.

The text also mentions the use of diverse data collection, which can help reduce bias by ensuring that the dataset includes a wide range of examples. By collecting data from multiple sources or under different conditions, it is more likely that the dataset will capture the natural variability of the population, reducing the risk of bias.

In summary, while the provided text does not explicitly mention the use of techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, it does touch upon related concepts such as stratified sampling and diverse data collection. These techniques can help ensure that the training and validation datasets are representative of the entire population, reducing the risk of bias and improving the performance of machine learning models.
