Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for any of the deep learning pipelines mentioned in the papers. The papers discuss various methods and techniques for applying deep learning to wildlife image analysis, such as the Siamese relation network (Cheng et al., 2021), the deep residual neural network (ResNet-50) (Clune, 2018; Willi et al., 2019), and the region-based convolutional neural network (Sch√ºtz et al., 2021). However, none of the papers mention a specific code repository or provide a link to one.

It is possible that the authors have made the code available on their personal or institutional websites, or on a platform such as GitHub, but the context provided does not include this information. Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query.
