Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix. The context mainly discusses the deployment and usage of acoustic recorders to collect data on a certain species, as well as statistical analyses performed on that data.

However, it is possible to infer some general postprocessing steps that might have been taken based on common practices in machine learning and data analysis.

After training a machine learning model, it is common to evaluate the model's performance using various metrics. These metrics can include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve, among others. These metrics can help assess the model's ability to make correct predictions and identify any potential issues or biases in the model.

Another common postprocessing step is generating a confusion matrix. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predictions made by a classification model. It shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. A confusion matrix can provide insights into how the model is performing and help identify areas where the model may need improvement.

Saliency maps can also be generated as a postprocessing step. A saliency map is a visualization tool that highlights the parts of an input that a model considers most important for making its prediction. Saliency maps can be useful for understanding how a model is making its predictions and identifying any potential issues or biases in the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps taken after model training, it is possible to infer some common postprocessing steps that might have been taken based on general practices in machine learning and data analysis. These steps can include evaluating the model's performance using various metrics, generating a confusion matrix, and creating saliency maps.
