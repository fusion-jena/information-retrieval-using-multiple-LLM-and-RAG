Based on the provided context, there is no information about a code repository for the deep learning pipeline used to predict dissolved oxygen concentration. The sources mention various studies and models used for predicting dissolved oxygen concentration in water, but they do not include any details about the availability of the code repositories.

For instance, Heddam et al. (2022b) used a long-short term memory (LSTM) deep learning model for predicting dissolved oxygen concentration in rivers, but the source does not mention where the code is available. Similarly, Moghadam et al. (2021) applied a deep recurrent neural network model for predicting river dissolved oxygen concentration, but the code repository is not provided.

However, some studies have used machine learning techniques for predicting dissolved oxygen concentration, such as Najah et al. (2014) who compared the performance of ANFIS and MLP-NN dissolved oxygen prediction models. Still, the context does not mention any code repositories for these models.

In conclusion, while there are several studies that have developed models for predicting dissolved oxygen concentration, the provided context does not include any information about the availability of the code repositories for these deep learning pipelines.
