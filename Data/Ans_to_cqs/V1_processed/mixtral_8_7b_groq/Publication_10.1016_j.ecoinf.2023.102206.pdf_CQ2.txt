The provided context includes several examples of data formats used in various research studies, some of which involve deep learning techniques. Here are some of the data formats mentioned:

1. Image: The Brodatz texture dataset, Intel Berkeley dataset, de Montfort university robotics dataset, and robotics laboratory data are examples of image datasets used in deep learning studies. These datasets are likely used for tasks such as image segmentation or object detection.
2. Audio: The proposed work in the context utilizes acoustic data to identify oestrus and non-oestrus sounds of sows. This suggests that audio data is being used in a deep learning pipeline, likely for sound classification or detection.
3. Time-series: The housing dataset, synthetic dataset, and email spam filtering text dataset are examples of time-series datasets used in deep learning studies. These datasets are likely used for tasks such as regression or classification.
4. Multivalued (MV) data: The glutamic acid fermentation process modeling dataset is an example of a multivalued (MV) dataset used in a deep learning study. This dataset is likely used for process modeling or optimization.
5. EEG signals: Several studies mentioned in the context use EEG signals in deep learning pipelines. These signals are likely used for tasks such as driver drowsiness estimation or epileptic electroencephalogram signal recognition.

It's worth noting that while these are specific examples of data formats used in deep learning studies, deep learning techniques can be applied to a wide variety of data formats, including video, text, and other sensor data. The choice of data format depends on the specific problem being addressed and the available data.
