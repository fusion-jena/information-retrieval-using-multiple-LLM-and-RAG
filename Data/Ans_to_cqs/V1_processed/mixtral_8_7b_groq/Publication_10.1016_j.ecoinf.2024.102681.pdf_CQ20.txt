The provided context does not offer explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions the use of a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for predicting drought propagation, but it does not specify whether this model was trained on Central Processing Units (CPUs), Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), or other types of hardware. Therefore, I cannot definitively answer this question without additional context.
