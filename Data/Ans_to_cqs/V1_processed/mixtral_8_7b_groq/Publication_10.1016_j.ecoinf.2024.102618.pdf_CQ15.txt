The context provided does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of different deep learning models, including DenseNet201, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB3, InceptionResNetv2, and ResNet50v2. These models may have been trained using various optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), or others.

SGD is a popular optimization technique for training deep learning models. It updates the model parameters by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter and then adjusting the parameter in the opposite direction of the gradient.

Adam is another optimization technique that has gained popularity in deep learning. It is an extension of SGD that adaptively adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradient information.

Other optimization techniques that may have been used in the deep learning pipeline include RMSprop, Adagrad, and AdaDelta.

In summary, while the context provided does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that one or more of the commonly used optimization techniques, such as SGD, Adam, or others, were used for training the deep learning models.
