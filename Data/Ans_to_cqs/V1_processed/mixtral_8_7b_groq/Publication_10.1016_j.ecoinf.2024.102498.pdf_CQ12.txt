The deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). CNNs are mentioned as being particularly effective for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification. They operate by learning sophisticated features from patches of satellite imagery, enabling them to recognize intricate patterns. On the other hand, RNNs are noted for their ability to learn and adapt to evolving LULC patterns continuously. This adaptability enables the model to capture temporal shifts and variations in land cover patterns. Therefore, both CNNs and RNNs play a significant role in the deep learning-based LULC mapping pipeline.
