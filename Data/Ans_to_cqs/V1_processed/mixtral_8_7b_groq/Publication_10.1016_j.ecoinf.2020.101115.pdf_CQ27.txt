Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. The text mainly discusses data management, high-level process flows for storing and analyzing samples, and the use of controlled vocabularies for data interoperability. However, it does not mention any specifics about model serialization, platform selection, or model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.
