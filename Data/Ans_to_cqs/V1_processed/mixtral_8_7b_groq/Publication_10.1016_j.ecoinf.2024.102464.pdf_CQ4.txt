The provided context does not include information about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss a study that uses machine learning models for species distribution modeling. Therefore, I will answer the query based on common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning, not specifically in the context of this study.

Data augmentation techniques are essential for improving the performance and robustness of deep learning models, especially when dealing with limited data. Common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotation, scaling, and translation.

1. Flipping: This technique involves horizontally or vertically flipping the images in the dataset. Horizontal flipping is more common, as it helps the model generalize better and prevents overfitting.

2. Rotation: Rotating images at various angles can help the model learn rotational invariance and improve its ability to recognize objects at different orientations.

3. Scaling: Scaling or zooming images can help the model learn to recognize objects at different scales. This is particularly useful for object detection tasks where objects may appear at various sizes within an image.

4. Translation: Translation involves shifting the image horizontally or vertically. This helps the model learn spatial invariance and improve its ability to recognize objects in different positions within an image.

These techniques can be applied individually or in combination to create a more diverse dataset for training deep learning models. It is important to note that the choice of data augmentation techniques depends on the specific task and dataset at hand.

In summary, common data augmentation techniques in deep learning include flipping, rotation, scaling, and translation. These techniques help improve model performance and robustness by increasing the diversity of the training dataset. However, the provided context does not contain specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the study.
