The text provided does not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of data sub-sampling and the Visual Genome QA dataset, which could indirectly relate to handling randomness.

 In the context of the study, data sub-sampling is used to randomly select feature maps/channels in each convolution layer of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and reconstruct them back to image pixels. This approach aims to reveal the structures within each patch that stimulated a particular feature map, as well as discover which portions of the training images caused the firing of neurons. This technique can help improve understanding of the transformation of features learned in each layer and the characteristic of each layer in the CNN.

 The Visual Genome QA dataset, which contains 1.7 million questions/answer pairs, is not directly related to handling randomness. However, it could be used in conjunction with deep learning techniques to improve model performance by providing additional data for training.

 In general, deep learning pipelines may employ strategies such as using a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results, particularly in the context of data preprocessing, model initialization, and weight initialization. These strategies can help ensure that the randomness introduced in the pipeline, such as through data shuffling or stochastic gradient descent, does not significantly impact the model's performance or the ability to replicate results.

 Therefore, while the provided text does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention techniques that could be used in conjunction with such strategies, such as data sub-sampling and the use of additional datasets for training. Additionally, deep learning pipelines may employ strategies such as using a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.
