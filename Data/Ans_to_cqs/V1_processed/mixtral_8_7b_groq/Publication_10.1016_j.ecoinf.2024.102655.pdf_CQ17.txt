The provided context does not directly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout and L2 regularization. However, it does discuss the problem of overfitting and over-training in machine learning models, particularly in the context of water quality prediction.

To prevent overfitting, researchers have developed various regularization techniques that can be applied during the training of deep learning models. Dropout is one such technique, where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent over-reliance on specific neurons and thus reduces overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2014). L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is another common method that discourages large weights in the model by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which in turn helps to reduce overfitting (Goodfellow et al., 2016).

The context highlights the challenges of working with water quality datasets, including the potential for redundant information and the need to select representative and variable scenarios for model training. These considerations are crucial in preventing overfitting and ensuring the development of robust predictive models.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention dropout and L2 regularization, it does discuss the importance of preventing overfitting in machine learning models, particularly in the context of water quality prediction. Dropout and L2 regularization are two commonly used regularization techniques in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting.
