Based on the provided context, the deep learning models being used are a "PConv network" and a "Classification network."

The PConv network is used for image completion, specifically for completing holes in images. This is evident from the context that mentions "generated holes" and "freezing the batch normalization layer in the encoder part as the network used pre-trained weights with a small batch size of 1" which suggests that the network is being used to fill in missing parts of images.

On the other hand, the Classification network is used for plant species identification. This is clear from the context that mentions "To train our classification model, we adapted the vgg16 network pre-trained on ImageNet dataset" and "Pretrained classification models such as VGG16 have demonstrated to perform well on various plant species identification tasks."

Therefore, the PConv network is being used for image completion and the Classification network is being used for image classification. It's important to note that the context does not provide information about any other deep learning models such as segmentation or detection.
