Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the use of MS (multispectral) point cloud data and synthetic data for training a deep learning (DL) model to predict wildfire response of forest species. It also explains how the trained model is used for fuel model retrieval. However, it does not provide information on the strategies employed to tackle data bias during the preprocessing phase.

Data bias can be addressed using techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified sampling ensures that the subsets of the data used for training and testing are representative of the classes in the original dataset. Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances from underrepresented classes, while undersampling reduces the number of instances from overrepresented classes. Diverse data collection focuses on gathering data that covers a wide range of variability to ensure that the model is exposed to different patterns and scenarios during training.

Since the context does not mention any of these techniques, it is possible that the authors did not explicitly address data bias during preprocessing. However, they do mention the use of Mean IoU (MIoU) as an evaluation metric, which takes into account the individual values for each class within the dataset, enhancing the reliability of the classification results for imbalanced data. This suggests that the authors might have considered class imbalance as a form of data bias and addressed it during the evaluation phase rather than the preprocessing phase. Nonetheless, the specific techniques used to tackle data bias remain unknown based on the provided context.
