Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the described deep learning pipeline. The focus of the text is on the architecture of an autoencoder, specifically designed for soundscape data, and its components.

The pipeline consists of an encoder, a bottleneck, and a decoder. The encoder applies a pre-processing block containing a convolution with a wide receptive field (5 × 5 kernel) and signal coarsening along the time axis (2 × 1 kernel). Coarsening follows the changes suggested in He et al. (2018) and replicates later versions of BirdNet’s down-sampling strategy. The decoder up-samples latent features back to the original dimensions using transposed convolutions.

While data augmentation techniques can improve model performance and generalization, the context does not discuss their implementation in this specific deep learning pipeline.
