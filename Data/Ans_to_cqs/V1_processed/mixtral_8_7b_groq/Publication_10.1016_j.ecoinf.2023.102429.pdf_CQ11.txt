Based on the provided context, there is no direct information given about a data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context mainly focuses on the use of Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) for estimating total nitrogen (TN) in soil samples, using various spectral bands.

The methods mentioned in the context include Continuum Removal (CR), Random Forest (RF), Continuous Wavelet Transformation (CWT), LASSO, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Successive Projections Algorithm (SPA), and Weight Average Partial Least-Squares Regression (WAPLSR). However, none of these methods are specifically identified as a deep learning pipeline, and there is no mention of any data repository link associated with these methods.

Therefore, I cannot provide a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the given context.
