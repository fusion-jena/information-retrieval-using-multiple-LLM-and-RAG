The provided context does not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does describe a study that used a holdback trial partitioning test to determine the optimal number of footprint trails required for algorithm training and testing sets in estimating the population of captive Amur tigers. This study involved iterating the analysis multiple times with randomly selected trails, examining how the predicted outcome compared with the known test set size. This process inherently involves randomness, as the trails selected for each iteration are randomly chosen.

In the context of machine learning and deep learning, randomness can be introduced in various ways, such as:

1. Initialization of weights: Deep learning models typically initialize weights randomly, which can impact the model's learning process.
2. Data shuffling: Before training, data is often shuffled randomly to ensure that the model does not learn patterns specific to a particular order of the data.
3. Dropout: During training, dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out neurons from the network to prevent overfitting.
4. Batch sampling: When training a deep learning model, data is usually divided into batches, and the samples within each batch are selected randomly.

Strategies to handle randomness include:

1. Fixed random seed: By setting a fixed random seed value, the randomness can be controlled, ensuring reproducibility of the results.
2. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a machine learning model by partitioning the data into a training set and a validation set multiple times, with different random partitions each time.
3. Ensemble methods: Ensemble methods, such as bagging and boosting, use multiple models trained on different subsets of the data to improve the overall performance and reduce the impact of randomness.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, it does involve randomness in the data selection process. Strategies for handling randomness in deep learning include setting a fixed random seed value, cross-validation, and ensemble methods.
