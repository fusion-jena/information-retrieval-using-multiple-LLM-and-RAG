Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, there are some implicit indications of techniques that could contribute to the model's generalizability.

First, the study evaluates multiple object detection models, including Faster R-CNN, YOLOv5s, and a Proposed Method. Comparing different models can help identify a more generalizable model, as each model may have unique strengths and weaknesses.

Second, the Proposed Method seems to have undergone extensive tuning, as reported in Table 9. The method shows significantly lower errors in most measures compared to Faster R-CNN and YOLOv5s, suggesting that the proposed model might be better at capturing the underlying patterns in the data. Moreover, the Proposed Method uses Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) and an effective decoder module (DeepLabv3+) to improve the model's performance in capturing multi-scale information and refining segmentation boundaries. These techniques could potentially enhance the model's generalizability.

Third, the study mentions the use of a threshold during training for 3000 iterations and saving the best-performing model based on the validation loss. This process might implicitly indicate the use of some form of cross-validation or validation-based model selection, which can help improve the model's generalizability.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, there are indications of techniques that could contribute to the model's generalizability, such as model comparison, extensive model tuning, and potentially cross-validation or validation-based model selection. However, without more information, it is difficult to definitively answer this query.
