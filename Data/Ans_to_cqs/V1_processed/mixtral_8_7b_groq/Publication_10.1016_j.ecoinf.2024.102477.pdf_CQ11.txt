Unfortunately, the provided article does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in their study on air pollution and carbon monoxide in Taiwan. The article by Kavitha et al., 2023, mentions using a filter-based ensemble feature selection and deep learning model for intrusion detection in cloud computing, but there is no information about the data repository link. Similarly, the article by Kumar and Jain, 2010, uses ARIMA forecasting of ambient air pollutants, but there is no information about the data repository link.

 It is important to note that not all research articles provide a data repository link, and it may depend on the journal's policies or the researchers' decisions. Therefore, it is always a good practice to contact the authors directly if the information is not provided in the article.

 Additionally, the other articles in the context do not mention any deep learning pipeline or data repository link related to air pollution or carbon monoxide.

 Therefore, I am unable to provide a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study on air pollution and carbon monoxide in Taiwan.
