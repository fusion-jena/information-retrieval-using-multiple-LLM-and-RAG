Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline of the YWnet network. The context includes the abstract and some parts of the article "YWnet: A convolutional block attention-based fusion deep learning method for complex underwater small target detection" published in the Ecological Informatics journal. However, it does not mention any code repository where the implementation of the deep learning pipeline is available, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
