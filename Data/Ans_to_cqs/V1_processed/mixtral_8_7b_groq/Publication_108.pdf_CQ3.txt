The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of image segmentation or pixel-wise labeling was used, as the study involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on high-resolution orthophotos divided into labeled tiles. The network is used for land cover classification, distinguishing between areas greater than 0.5 ha, which suggests that each pixel in the tiles was assigned a class label. Therefore, it is likely that a per-pixel annotation method was used, although the exact technique (e.g., semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, or other forms of pixel-level annotation) remains undisclosed in the given context.
