Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline for land use and land cover (LULC) classification using remote sensing data primarily involves image data formats.

The studies mentioned in the context use satellite imagery data for training their deep learning models. For instance, M. Ganjirad and H. Bagheri (2024) use high-resolution remote sensing images based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for their deep learning fusion network. Similarly, Zhu et al. (2020) use Sentinel-2 Level-1C images for their So2Sat LCZ42 dataset. Zhu et al. (2021) use time series MODIS NDVI data for mapping abandoned farmland in China.

Moreover, Zhang et al. (2017) use RapidEye data, a high-resolution satellite imaging system, for their image classification study. They integrate spectral and textual features in a random forest classifier. While the context does not explicitly mention the data formats, it can be inferred that they use image data formats.

Therefore, it can be concluded that image data formats are primarily used in the deep learning pipeline for LULC classification in remote sensing applications. However, the context does not provide information on the use of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV in the deep learning pipeline for LULC classification.
