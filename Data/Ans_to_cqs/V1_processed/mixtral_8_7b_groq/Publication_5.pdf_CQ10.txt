I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline for species richness estimation. The context includes several research papers and reports related to the use of deep learning and other machine learning techniques for remote sensing and ecological data analysis. However, there is no information on the specific code repository or implementation details of the deep learning pipeline used in the studies. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to the deep learning pipeline's code repository.
