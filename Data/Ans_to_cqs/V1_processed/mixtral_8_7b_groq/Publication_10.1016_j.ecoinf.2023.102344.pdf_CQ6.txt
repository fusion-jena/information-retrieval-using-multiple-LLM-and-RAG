Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models in Approach 2. However, it can be inferred that the raw bivalve images were used as inputs to the pre-trained networks without any manual feature extraction. This suggests that some level of preprocessing was done, as it is common practice to perform certain preprocessing steps before training deep learning models.

Common preprocessing steps for image data include:

1. Normalization: This involves scaling the pixel intensity values to a range between 0 and 1. This helps to ensure that all input images have similar scales, which can improve the training process.
2. Resizing: This involves resizing the images to a consistent size. This is important because deep learning models typically require fixed-size inputs.
3. Data augmentation: This involves creating modified versions of the original images by applying random transformations such as rotation, flipping, and cropping. This can help to increase the size of the training dataset and reduce overfitting.

It is possible that some or all of these preprocessing steps were applied to the raw bivalve images before they were used as inputs to the pre-trained networks in Approach 2. However, the context does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state the preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models in Approach 2, it can be inferred that some level of preprocessing was done. Common preprocessing steps for image data include normalization, resizing, and data augmentation.
