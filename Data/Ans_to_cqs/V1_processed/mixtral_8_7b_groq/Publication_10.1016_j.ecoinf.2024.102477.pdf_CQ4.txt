The provided context does not specifically mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss two deep learning models, SLSTM and SGRU, which are used for time-series prediction.

Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size of the training dataset and improve model performance by generating new samples through transformations of the existing data. Some of the most common data augmentation techniques for image data include flipping, rotation, and scaling.

Flipping involves creating a mirrored image of the original data by flipping it horizontally or vertically. This technique can help the model generalize better and improve its performance on unseen data.

Rotation involves rotating the image by a certain angle, which can help the model learn rotation invariant features.

Scaling involves changing the size of the image, which can help the model learn to recognize objects at different scales.

However, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for time-series prediction using SLSTM or SGRU models. It is possible that different data augmentation techniques are used for time-series data, or that data augmentation is not necessary or applicable for these models.

Therefore, we cannot provide a specific answer to the query based on the given context. It is recommended to refer to the relevant literature or consult with a deep learning expert for more information on data augmentation techniques in the deep learning pipeline for time-series prediction.
