The provided context does not include specific information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention several deep learning methods and machine learning models that are used for time-series prediction and other tasks.

To answer the query, I will provide a general overview of some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning.

Data annotation is the process of labeling or marking up data so that it can be used to train machine learning models. In the context of computer vision, data annotation techniques include:

1. **Bounding box annotation:** This involves drawing a box around an object in an image to identify its location and size. Bounding box annotation is commonly used for object detection tasks, where the goal is to identify and locate objects within an image.
2. **Instance segmentation:** This is a more detailed form of annotation where each pixel in an image is labeled with the class of the object it belongs to. Instance segmentation is used for tasks such as semantic segmentation, where the goal is to classify every pixel in an image, or object segmentation, where the goal is to identify and segment individual objects within an image.
3. **Semantic segmentation:** This is a type of image segmentation where pixels are grouped into regions based on their shared characteristics or semantic meaning. Semantic segmentation is used for tasks such as scene understanding, where the goal is to identify and classify objects within an image.
4. **Keypoint annotation:** This involves identifying and labeling key points or landmarks on an object within an image. Keypoint annotation is commonly used for tasks such as facial recognition or pose estimation.

These are just a few examples of data annotation techniques used in deep learning. The specific technique used will depend on the task at hand and the type of data being used. Proper data annotation is crucial for training accurate and effective machine learning models, as it provides the model with the necessary information to learn from the data.
