Based on the information provided, there is no explicit description of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer some steps that might have been taken based on common practices in deep learning.

First, the model would likely have been saved or serialized after training. This is a common step in deep learning where the trained model is saved to disk so that it can be loaded and used later without having to retrain the model. The notebooks used to define and train the models are available in the supplementary materials, but the specific method used to save the models is not mentioned.

Next, the platform for deployment would have been selected. This could range from a local machine to a cloud-based platform. The high performance cluster (SI/HPC) mentioned in the acknowledgements might have been used for deployment, but this is not explicitly stated.

After these steps, the model would have been loaded and integrated into an application or service. Again, the specifics of this step are not provided in the context.

It's also worth noting that the deep learning models are CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) designed for image classification tasks. The models are trained on image data and output class labels for the input images.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit details on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it is likely that the model was serialized after training, and then loaded and integrated into an application or service on a local or cloud-based platform.
