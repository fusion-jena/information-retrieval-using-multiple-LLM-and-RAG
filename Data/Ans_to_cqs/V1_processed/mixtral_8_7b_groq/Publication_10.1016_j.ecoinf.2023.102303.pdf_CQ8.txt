Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the collection and labeling of the FishInTurbidWater dataset, as well as the development of two novel deep learning models using semi-supervised contrastive learning and weak supervision. However, it does not specify where the code for these models is hosted. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
