The deep learning pipeline in the study employes the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a momentum value of Î¼ = 0.9 for training the model. The use of the momentum term in the SGD optimizer helps to accelerate learning in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations, leading to smoother convergence.

The authors trained models on the training sets and monitored the training process on the validation set. The training process was halted when the loss value of the model on the validation set ceased to decrease further. The model's performance was then evaluated on the test set.

The study utilized the PyTorch 1.7.1 platform for the deep learning environment and conducted the experiments on a Dell PowerEdge C4130 rack server with two Tesla K80 GPUs and 256 GB of memory.

It is important to note that the study does not mention the use of any other optimization techniques such as Adam, Adagrad, or RMSProp. However, the authors do use transfer learning, which is a technique for initializing a deep learning model with pre-trained weights from another model. In this study, the authors used a pre-trained model on the ImageNet-1 k dataset as one of the source models for transfer learning.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in this study uses the SGD optimizer with a momentum value of 0.9 for training the model, and transfer learning for initializing the model with pre-trained weights.
