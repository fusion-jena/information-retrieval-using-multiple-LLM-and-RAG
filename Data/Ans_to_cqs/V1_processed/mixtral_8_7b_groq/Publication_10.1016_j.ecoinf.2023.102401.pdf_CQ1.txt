The initial stage in a deep learning pipeline involves the collection of raw data, which is then processed and utilized for training models. In the context provided, the specific example refers to the development of a system for underwater target detection. However, the text does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in this particular pipeline.

Generally, in the field of underwater target detection, data collection can be carried out using various methods such as:

1. Surveys: Marine surveys can be conducted using research vessels equipped with specialized instruments for data collection. These surveys can include methods like side-scan sonar, multibeam echosounder, and sub-bottom profiler surveys to gather data about the underwater environment.
2. Sensors: Specialized sensors and waterproof cameras can be used to collect data in different parts of the water column. These sensors can be attached to underwater vehicles, buoys, or autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for data collection.
3. Public datasets: Researchers and organizations may also use publicly available datasets for underwater target detection. These datasets can be useful for training and testing deep learning models, and they can save time and resources associated with collecting and labeling data.

In the context provided, the specific steps for preparing data involve selecting appropriate water downloading gear and sensors for data collection, followed by pre-processing of the acquired data, such as denoising, image enhancement, and correction. The dataset is then labeled and separated into training and test images for model development.

Therefore, while the text does not explicitly mention the methods used for data collection, it can be inferred that sensors and specialized gear are used for data collection in this deep learning pipeline for underwater target detection.
