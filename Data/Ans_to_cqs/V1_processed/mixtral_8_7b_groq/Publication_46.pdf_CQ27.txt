The text provided does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was developed and tested, and that it outperformed the traditional BIOCLIM model in predicting the species distribution.

The CNN model is a type of deep learning-based model that follows a grid pattern and learns and adapts to the spatial hierarchies of features from lower to higher levels. It is composed of three layers: convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers. Feature extraction is conducted using the first two layers, and mapping the extracted features to the output is conducted by the third layer.

The input parameters for both models were acquired from recent satellite missions, including MODIS, Sentinel-2, Sentinel-5p, SRTM, and ECOSTRESS. The performance of the models was evaluated using the Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metrics.

The text also mentions that the methodology of the convolution and full connected layer is provided in the Supplementary Materials, but it does not give information about the model deployment process.

Therefore, I don't know the specifics of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
