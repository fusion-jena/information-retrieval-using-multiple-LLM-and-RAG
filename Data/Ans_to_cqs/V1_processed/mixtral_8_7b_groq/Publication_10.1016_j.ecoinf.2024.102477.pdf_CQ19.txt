Based on the provided context, specific deep learning frameworks used for building the models are not mentioned. However, it is mentioned that long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) models were used for time-series prediction in the domain of air pollution analysis. Both LSTM and GRU are types of recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

RNNs are a type of neural network that use backpropagation techniques and short-term memory to enhance their time-series prediction performance. LSTM and GRU are popular choices for sequence modeling and have been used in various applications such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and time-series forecasting.

To build and implement LSTM and GRU models, deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch can be used. TensorFlow is an open-source platform for machine learning and artificial intelligence developed by Google Brain Team. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications. PyTorch, on the other hand, is an open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. It is primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention which deep learning frameworks were used to build the LSTM and GRU models, it can be inferred that TensorFlow, PyTorch, or other similar deep learning frameworks could have been used for implementation.
