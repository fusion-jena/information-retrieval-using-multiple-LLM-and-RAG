The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It does not mention any specific methods such as grid search or random search. However, it does discuss the hyperparameter λ2 and its optimal values for different regions and species.

The study evaluates the performance of the model with different λ2 values for six regions (AWT, CAN, NSW, NZ, SA, and SWI) and observes that the optimal λ2 value varies for different regions. The model performs best with a λ2 value of 0.5 for the AWT region, and the performances of the remaining regions closely approach the best mean AUC achievable.

Furthermore, the study notes that different species within the same region may have different optimal values for the hyperparameter λ2. Consequently, setting distinct λ2 values per species could improve model performance. The study suggests that higher values of λ2 could be set for known generalist species, especially if there is a strong sampling bias.

Therefore, while the text does not provide explicit information about the optimization method used for the hyperparameters, it does suggest that the λ2 hyperparameter is optimized by setting its value based on the region and species being modeled.
