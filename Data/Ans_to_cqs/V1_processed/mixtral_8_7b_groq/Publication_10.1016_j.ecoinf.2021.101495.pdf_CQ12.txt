The deep learning models used in the pipeline are a convolutional neural network (CNN) for segmentation and a residual neural network (ResNet) for classification.

For the segmentation task, the specific type of CNN used is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that a CNN is used because the segmentation is performed on individual fishes, and CNNs are commonly used for image segmentation tasks due to their ability to extract spatial features from images.

For the classification task, the specific type of deep learning model used is a ResNet50V2 model, which is a type of residual neural network (ResNet). ResNets are a type of CNN that introduce "skip connections" or "shortcut connections" that allow the model to skip some of its layers. This helps to alleviate the problem of vanishing gradients, which is a common issue in deep neural networks. The specific implementation of ResNet used in this case is ResNet50V2, which is a variant of ResNet50 with some modifications to the original architecture.

Therefore, the deep learning models used in the pipeline are a CNN for segmentation and a ResNet for classification.
