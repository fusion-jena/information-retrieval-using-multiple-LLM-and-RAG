The text provided discusses the process of obtaining and filtering environmental data for use in ecological studies, specifically using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. However, it does not directly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline.

Based on general knowledge of remote sensing and data acquisition, it can be inferred that in the context of environmental data and ecological processes, raw data is likely collected through various sensors, such as satellites or airborne instruments. These sensors capture measurements of different variables, such as land surface temperature, vegetation indices, or elevation, which are then processed and organized into large datasets.

Additionally, public datasets, like those available in the GEE online repository, can serve as a valuable source of raw data for deep learning applications. These datasets often contain pre-processed data, which has been cleaned, calibrated, and organized, making it easier to use in machine learning models.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that raw data is typically obtained through sensors or public datasets, which are then filtered and pre-processed for use in ecological studies.
