The text provided gives information about the steps taken to ensure the stability and performance of the deep learning model, which can indirectly imply the measures taken to ensure its generalizability.

Firstly, the dataset was divided into three parts: training, validation, and testing (60%, 20%, and 20%, respectively). This division was performed in a stratified manner, meaning that class proportions were maintained across all the parts. This approach helps to ensure that the model is exposed to a diverse range of data during training, and that its performance is evaluated on unseen data, thereby increasing its ability to generalize.

Secondly, the model's performance was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the model's performance, and by using them, the researchers could ensure that the model was not overfitting to the training data and was able to generalize well.

Thirdly, the learning curves of the models were analyzed to ensure convergence and to determine the optimal number of epochs. This step is crucial to prevent overfitting and to ensure that the model can learn the underlying patterns in the data, which in turn improves its ability to generalize.

Lastly, different network models were compared, and the ResNet50 model was selected as it performed the best for four out of five categories. This model was then applied to classify the case study area, and the results corresponded to the actual situation.

In conclusion, although the text does not explicitly mention cross-validation, it does provide information about the use of a diverse dataset, stratified splitting, performance evaluation, learning curve analysis, and model comparison. These steps collectively contribute to ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model.
