Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

In the context of the ESK model for fish classification, the authors mentioned that they used three families with a large number of species and obvious interspecific variation for verification. However, they did not specify how the data was split for training, validation, and testing.

Therefore, while the criteria used to split the data for the ESK model are not explicitly stated in the provided context, it is reasonable to assume that they followed standard practices in machine learning and deep learning by splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets.
