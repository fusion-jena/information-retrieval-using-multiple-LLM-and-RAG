Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the specific platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model. The context includes two research papers by S.K. Sain et al., published in the journal Ecological Informatics in 2024, which discuss the use of machine learning models for predicting Cassava Lethal Necrosis Disease (CLCuD). The papers present the results of three machine learning algorithms: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Bootstrap Forest, and Boosted Tree.

The authors provide a table (Table 3) that lists the variables or regressors used in the models and their corresponding importance scores. However, there is no mention of the platform used for deploying the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer to this query.
