The provided context does not specifically mention the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of Random Forest (RF) models in the context of mapping seagrass habitats. RF is a machine learning method that combines decision trees and bootstrapping, but it is not a deep learning method.

In deep learning, optimization techniques are used to adjust the weights and biases of the model during training to minimize the loss function. Some common optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.

SGD is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the weights and biases in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. Adam is an extension of SGD that adaptively adjusts the learning rate based on the historical gradient information. RMSprop is another optimization algorithm that also adaptively adjusts the learning rate based on the historical gradient information, but it uses a different approach to calculate the adaptive learning rate.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot answer the query regarding the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide a general overview of some common optimization techniques used in deep learning.
