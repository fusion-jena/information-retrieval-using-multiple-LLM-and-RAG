Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. Hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization are commonly used to find the best set of hyperparameters for a model. However, the text does not mention any of these techniques being used.

The context does provide information about the different models that were tested, including ResNet-18, ResNet-50, VGG-11-bn, VGG-16-bn, MobileNet-V3, RepVGG-A0, and RepVGG-A1. It also mentions that the models were tested using a five-fold SE Protocol with an OR method. However, these details do not provide information about how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized.

It is possible that the hyperparameters of the models were optimized prior to the testing phase and the optimized hyperparameters were used during the testing phase. However, without explicit information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
