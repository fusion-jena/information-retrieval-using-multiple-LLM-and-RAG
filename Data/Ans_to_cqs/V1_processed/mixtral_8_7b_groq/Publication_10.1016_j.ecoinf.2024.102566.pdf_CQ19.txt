Based on the provided context, there is no information suggesting that a deep learning model was constructed using specific frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The study by EcologicalInformatics81(2024)10256613 focuses on estimating forest biomass using a method that integrates forest inventory data with remote sensing imagery, but it does not mention the use of deep learning models or any related frameworks.

The study primarily references works related to forest biomass estimation, phytocoenological characteristics, and community classification of Abies fargesii forests. It provides data on the total biomass of needleleaf, broadleaf, and mixed forests from the 4th to 9th forest inventory periods in Xiaolong Forest. However, it does not contain information about deep learning model development or the use of TensorFlow, PyTorch, or other similar frameworks.

Therefore, the answer to the query is:


The provided context does not offer information on the frameworks used to build a deep learning model for forest biomass estimation.
