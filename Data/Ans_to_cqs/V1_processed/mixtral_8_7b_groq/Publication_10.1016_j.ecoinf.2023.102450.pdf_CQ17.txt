The provided context discusses the training of a Siamese network for animal tracking using few-shot learning, as well as several pieces of information about wild animal recognition and deep learning. However, it does not directly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.

Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models, especially deep learning models, by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Common regularization methods include L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping.

L1 and L2 regularization add a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the absolute or squared magnitude of the model's weights, respectively. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, reducing the risk of overfitting.

Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the model's activations to zero during training. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron, reducing the risk of overfitting.

Early stopping is a regularization technique that stops training when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving. This prevents the model from continuing to learn from noisy or outlier data, reducing the risk of overfitting.

Without more information from the context, it is not possible to determine which specific regularization methods were used in the training of the Siamese network for animal tracking. However, it is mentioned that the network was trained using few-shot learning, which is a type of transfer learning that can help prevent overfitting by leveraging knowledge from a related task. Additionally, the network's classification branch includes a refinement module that suppresses false-positive detections and filters background interference, which could also help prevent overfitting.
