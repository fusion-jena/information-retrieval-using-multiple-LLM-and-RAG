The provided context does not contain specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some variables and datasets used in a study related to species distribution modeling, such as BIOCLIM variables and the Maxent model. These variables are likely derived from datasets that have already been collected and processed.

In general, raw data for deep learning can come from various sources, including but not limited to:

1. Surveys: Human-conducted surveys can provide labeled data for supervised learning tasks. For example, surveys can be used to collect data on people's opinions, preferences, or behaviors.
2. Sensors: Sensors can provide continuous data streams that can be used for various tasks, such as image recognition, speech recognition, or anomaly detection. Examples of sensors include cameras, microphones, temperature sensors, and pressure sensors.
3. Public datasets: There are many public datasets available that can be used for deep learning tasks. These datasets cover a wide range of domains, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics. Examples of public datasets include ImageNet, COCO, and the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

In the context of species distribution modeling, raw data might come from various sources such as field observations, remote sensing data, or weather stations. These data are then used to derive the BIOCLIM variables, which describe various aspects of the climate at a given location.

It's worth noting that the preprocessing of raw data is an essential step in the deep learning pipeline. Preprocessing can include data cleaning, normalization, augmentation, and splitting into training, validation, and test sets. The provided context mentions the use of scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library for Python, which includes various tools for data preprocessing.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not contain specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it does provide some insight into the types of data used in species distribution modeling. Raw data for deep learning can come from various sources, such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Preprocessing of raw data is an essential step in the deep learning pipeline, and tools such as scikit-learn can be used for this purpose.
