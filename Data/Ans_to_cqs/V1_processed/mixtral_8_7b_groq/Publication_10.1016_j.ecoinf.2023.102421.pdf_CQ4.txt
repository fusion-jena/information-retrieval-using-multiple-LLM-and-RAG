The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The study focuses on using a tabulated dataset with 39 features, including on-field Aboveground Biomass (AGB) and independent features, to train and validate machine learning models. Specifically, it uses XGBoost and LightGBM models, which are tree-based methods and do not typically involve data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Instead, the study optimizes hyperparameters of these models using Bayesian optimizers and TDO (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator for Optimization) with RMSE as the objective function. Therefore, based on the given context, no data augmentation techniques were applied in this study.
