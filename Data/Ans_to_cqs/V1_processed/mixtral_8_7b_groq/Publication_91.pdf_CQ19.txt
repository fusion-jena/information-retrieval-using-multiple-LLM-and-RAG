Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the model. The text describes the dataset, data preprocessing steps, and training parameters for a deep learning model used for pollen species identification. However, it does not mention any specific deep learning libraries or frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
