The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, where it mentions the use of models pre-trained on ImageNet, a large-scale image recognition dataset. Specifically, the base models used are MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3-Large, and MobileNetV3-Small, all of which are CNN architectures designed for mobile and embedded vision applications. Furthermore, the feature extraction process involves using the output of the last layer, also known as the bottleneck layer, before the flatten operation. This bottleneck layer typically contains high-level, generic features learned by the convolutional layers, which are then used for the new task of plant and tree species recognition. The use of CNNs for feature extraction and classification is a common approach in computer vision tasks, including image recognition and classification.
