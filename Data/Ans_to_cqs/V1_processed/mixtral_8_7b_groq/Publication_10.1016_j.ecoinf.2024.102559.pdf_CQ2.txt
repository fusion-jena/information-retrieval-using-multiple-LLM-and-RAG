The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of aerial images from the 2020 National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) archive, which are likely in a raster image format such as GeoTIFF. The open-source Scikit-image library is used for image processing, further supporting the assumption of raster image data format. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline primarily uses raster image data format.
