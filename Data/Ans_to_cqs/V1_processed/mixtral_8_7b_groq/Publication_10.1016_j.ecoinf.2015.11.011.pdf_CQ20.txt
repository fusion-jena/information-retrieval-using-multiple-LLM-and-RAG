The provided context does not contain information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The text discusses the use of eCognition for image segmentation and classification, as well as the application of machine learning techniques to improve these processes. It also mentions the use of the Mixed GAM Computation Vehicle (MGCV) for modeling, but it does not specify the hardware used for these computations.

In general, deep learning models can be trained on various types of hardware, including CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. GPUs are particularly well-suited for deep learning due to their ability to perform many calculations simultaneously, which can significantly speed up the training process. TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) are specialized hardware developed by Google for machine learning applications, and they can offer even greater performance than GPUs for certain tasks.

Therefore, while the provided context does not specify the hardware used for training deep learning models, it is likely that GPUs or TPUs would be used for this purpose, given their suitability for the computations involved in deep learning.
