Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer some steps that might have been taken based on common practices in deep learning model deployment.

First, after training the model with the mean scaled absolute error as regression loss, using a batch size of 1, an input image resolution of 1536 Ã— 768 pixels, and a learning rate of 10, the model would need to be evaluated and validated. This process would involve testing the model on a separate dataset not used in training to ensure that it generalizes well to new data.

Once the model has been validated, it would be time to serialize it. Model serialization involves saving the model's architecture and weights to disk so that it can be loaded and used later without having to retrain the model. In Python, this can be done using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch, which provide functions to save and load models.

After serialization, the next step would be to select a platform for deploying the model. This could be a local machine, a cloud server, or an edge device, depending on the use case. For example, if the model is intended to be used for real-time image analysis in a remote location, an edge device like a Raspberry Pi or a Jetson Nano might be a suitable platform. On the other hand, if the model is intended for batch processing of large datasets, a cloud server might be a better choice.

Once the platform has been selected, the model would need to be deployed and integrated into the intended application. This could involve writing code to load the model, preprocess input data, run the model on the input data, and postprocess the output. Libraries like TensorFlow Serving or TorchServe can simplify this process by providing tools to deploy and manage models as services.

In summary, while the provided context does not give explicit details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, we can infer that it likely involved model evaluation and validation, serialization, platform selection, and deployment.
