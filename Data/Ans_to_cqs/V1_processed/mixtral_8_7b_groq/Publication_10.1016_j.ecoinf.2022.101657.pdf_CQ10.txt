Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used for species identification in camera trap data. The text discusses the use of a specific neural network architecture, transfer learning, and the mAP50 metric for evaluating the model's performance. It also mentions the desire to train the network for bespoke sets of species and the potential of low-power neural networks in hardware. However, there is no mention of a specific code repository or location where the implementation can be found.
