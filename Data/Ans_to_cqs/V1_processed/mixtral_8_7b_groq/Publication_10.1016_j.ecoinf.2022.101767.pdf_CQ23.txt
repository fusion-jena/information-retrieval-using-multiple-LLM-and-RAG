Based on the provided context, there is no information about the use of a deep learning model, its generalizability, or any measures taken to ensure it such as having a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

However, the context does mention a study that analyzed the number of views of online shared videos containing wild bird species. This study used a wrapper feature selection algorithm working with random forest analysis to determine the importance of selected factors in explaining the number of views in each video. The factors included objects and text in the thumbnail information, number of uploaded videos, length of each video, and number of days since uploading.

Therefore, while there is no information about a deep learning model and its generalizability, there is some context about the use of machine learning techniques, specifically random forest analysis, in analyzing the relationship between the number of views of online shared videos and factors related to the videos.
