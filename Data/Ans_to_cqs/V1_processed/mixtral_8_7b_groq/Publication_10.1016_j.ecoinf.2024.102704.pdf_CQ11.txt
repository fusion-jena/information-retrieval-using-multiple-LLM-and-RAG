Based on the provided context, there is no direct information given about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context mainly focuses on different deep learning models and techniques for optimizing memory access and performance. However, it does mention a few studies and papers that could potentially contain the required information.

The paper by Li et al. (2018) titled "SmartShuttle: Optimizing off-chip memory accesses for deep learning accelerators" discusses optimizing memory access for deep learning accelerators. However, it does not explicitly mention any data repository link.

Similarly, the papers by Li et al. (2022a, 2022b) and Li et al. (2022c) focus on fish passage monitoring and multiple fish tracking using deep learning models. While these studies might use a dataset for fish species, the context does not provide a link to the data repository.

Wang et al. (2019) and Wang et al. (2020) discuss techniques for reducing memory access and optimizing computational efficiency in deep learning models. These studies might use datasets for training and testing their models, but the context does not provide a link to the data repository.

In conclusion, the provided context does not contain the required information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that the studies mentioned in the context have their own data repositories, but the context does not provide any direct links.
