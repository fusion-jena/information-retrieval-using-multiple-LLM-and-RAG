Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The text focuses on the use of Random Forest as the method for building the prediction models, and it mentions the performance evaluation of the models using cross-validation. However, it does not mention the specific data splitting approach for model training and validation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
