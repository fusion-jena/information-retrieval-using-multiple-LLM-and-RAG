Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is classification. This is evident in several parts of the text. First, the model is referred to as a "deep-learning classifier" in the first paragraph. Additionally, the authors evaluate the classification results against a test sample and report error matrices, summary accuracy measures, and class accuracies, including the F1-score which provides class-specific accuracy. Furthermore, the authors compare the deep-learning classifier to a random forest classifier, indicating that both models are used for classification tasks. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model in this study is used for image classification.
