The data for the deep learning model training is split based on a chronological allocation strategy, which is designed to prevent data snooping bias and enhance the generalizability of the model. This strategy involves dividing the dataset into three parts: the training set, the validation set, and the test set.

The training set consists of 70% of the data, and it is used to train the model by adjusting the model parameters based on the error calculated from the model's predictions. The validation set, which contains 10% of the data, is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model and prevent overfitting. Specifically, the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during the training phase, and if the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade, the training process is stopped early.

Finally, the test set, which includes 20% of the data, is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. This set is used to provide an unbiased estimate of the model's generalization error, which is an essential metric for assessing the model's practical utility.

Overall, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training involve a chronological allocation strategy that simulates real-world scenarios and prevents data snooping bias. This strategy ensures that the data in the validation and test sets differ from the training set data, thereby enhancing the generalizability of the model.
