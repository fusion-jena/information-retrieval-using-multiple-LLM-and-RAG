Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text mentions that the authors used their own fork of Cafe, a deep learning framework, and various datasets (color, grayscale, and leaf segmented) for plant disease classification. However, it does not specify where the datasets are hosted or how to access them. Therefore, I cannot provide a data repository link based on the given context.
