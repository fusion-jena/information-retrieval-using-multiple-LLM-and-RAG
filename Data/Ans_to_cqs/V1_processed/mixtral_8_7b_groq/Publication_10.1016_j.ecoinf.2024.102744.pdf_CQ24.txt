The text provided does not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does discuss the use of specific techniques to improve the performance of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for pollen-bearing bee detection.

The CNN architecture described includes several layers that help mitigate overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize. These layers include convolutional layers with a probability of 0.5 for dropout, which randomly sets a fraction of the input units to 0 during training, helping to prevent overfitting. Additionally, the Global Average Pooling layer summarizes features, generating input for the fully connected layer, and facilitates the visualization of regions relied upon by the network for predictions.

The authors also introduce three improvements to the two baseline models, YOLOv5 and Faster RCNN, to handle the challenges of detecting pollen-bearing bees. These improvements include detecting bees from images, where the bee class encompasses both pollen-bearing and non-pollen-bearing bees, and using an overlap sampler to address the imbalance in the number of pollen-bearing bees compared to non-pollen-bearing bees.

While these techniques do not directly address randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they are important strategies for improving the performance and generalizability of CNNs. The use of a random seed value can help ensure reproducibility in the deep learning pipeline by controlling the randomness of initial weights and other sources of randomness in the training process. However, the text provided does not discuss this specific strategy.
