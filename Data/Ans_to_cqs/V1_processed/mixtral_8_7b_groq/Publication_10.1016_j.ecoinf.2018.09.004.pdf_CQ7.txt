The provided context discusses the use of cross-validation and stratified cross-validation for splitting data in the context of machine learning algorithms, but it does not specifically mention deep learning models. In the case of deep learning models, data splitting is typically done into training, validation, and testing sets.

The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and make decisions during the training process, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model performance. The exact criteria used to split the data can vary, but a common approach is to use a random split, where a certain percentage of the data is assigned to each set. For example, 70% of the data might be used for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.

Another approach for data splitting in deep learning is called k-fold cross-validation, which is similar to the cross-validation method mentioned in the context. In k-fold cross-validation, the data is divided into k folds, and the model is trained and validated k times, with each fold serving as the validation set once and the remaining k-1 folds serving as the training set. The performance of the model is then averaged over the k runs to get a more robust estimate of performance.

It is worth noting that the choice of data splitting method can have a significant impact on the performance of the model, and it is important to consider the specific characteristics of the data and the problem at hand when deciding how to split the data. Additionally, the use of stratified sampling, as mentioned in the context, can be beneficial in cases where the data is imbalanced, to ensure that each set has a representative distribution of classes.
