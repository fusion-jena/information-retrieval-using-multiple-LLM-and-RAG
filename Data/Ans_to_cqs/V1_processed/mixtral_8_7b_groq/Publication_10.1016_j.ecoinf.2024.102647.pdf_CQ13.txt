Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on the performance evaluation of machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART), in predicting groundwater salinity hazard maps.

However, the context mentions an "automated deep learning convolutional neural network algorithm" applied for soil salinity distribution mapping in Lake Urmia, Iran. Still, it does not provide details about the hyperparameters used in this deep learning model.

In general, hyperparameters in deep learning models can include learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, activation function, regularization, and dropout rate. The choice of hyperparameters can significantly impact the model's performance.

Therefore, without specific information about the deep learning model used in the study, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer to the query.
