The text provided does not give information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It discusses the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for plant species identification, comparing the scale of plant databases to general major datasets for images, videos, and languages. The text also mentions the V1 strategy used on the Malayakew dataset to analyze the global response of filters in each convolution layer and improve understanding of the transformation of features learned in each layer. However, there is no information about the data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
