The text provided does not give information about a deep learning model. Instead, it describes an ensemble modeling approach using four different models, including one regression-based model and three machine-learning models (MaxEnt, RF, and SVM), to predict the distribution of a study species. To ensure the model's performance, cross-validation was employed by using 70% of the dataset as training data to build the models and the other 30% as testing data to calculate the modelsâ€™ accuracy. The Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) was used as the index to specify the accuracy, with a higher AUC value indicating a more accurate model. However, the text does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the models, such as using a diverse dataset, stratified splitting, or techniques specific to deep learning models.
