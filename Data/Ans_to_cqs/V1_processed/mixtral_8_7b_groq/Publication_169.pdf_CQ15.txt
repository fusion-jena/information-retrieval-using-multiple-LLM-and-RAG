The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline for the experimental setup mentioned in the context is the Adam algorithm. The Adam optimization algorithm is a method used in gradient descent to update the parameters of the model. It is used to optimize the model parameters in the CNN-LSTM model implemented for plant species identification. The Adam algorithm was implemented with all parameters set to their default values. Other optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) were not mentioned in the context provided.
