The generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through several measures, including the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, and stratified splitting.

Firstly, the dataset used for training the model was diverse, consisting of data from 19 different stations collected over three years (2008-2010). This diversity in the dataset helped the model to learn a wide range of patterns and relationships, thereby improving its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Secondly, the dataset was split into three sets: training, validation, and test, using a 60-20-20 splitting strategy. This approach allowed for the model to be trained on a portion of the data, while the validation set was used to tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. The test set was then used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Furthermore, the splitting of the dataset was done using stratified sampling based on the year and location. Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures each stratum (in this case, year and location) is proportionally represented in the sample. This technique helped to ensure that the training, validation, and test sets were representative of the entire dataset, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize.

Lastly, the input variables were standardized, and the output variable was re-labeled and standardized. Standardizing the input variables helped to ensure that the model gave equal importance to all the features, while re-labeling and standardizing the output variable helped to improve the model's performance.

Therefore, the generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through the use of a diverse dataset, a 60-20-20 splitting strategy with stratified sampling, standardization of input variables, and re-labeling and standardization of the output variable.
