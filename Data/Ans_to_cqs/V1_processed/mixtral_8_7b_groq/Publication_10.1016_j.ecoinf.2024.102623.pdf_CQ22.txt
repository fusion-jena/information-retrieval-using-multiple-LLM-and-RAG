The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two metrics: the Area Under the Curve (AUC) and the mean area under the precision-recall gain curve (AUPRG). 

The AUC is a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes. It is calculated as the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which is a plot of the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. In the context provided, the AUC is reported for different loss functions, including Cross-Entropy (CE), Focal CE, Label-Distribution-Aware Margin loss (LDAM), and Distance-based loss (DB loss), among others. The performance is averaged over 10 random seeds.

On the other hand, the AUPRG is a measure of the model's performance in terms of precision and recall. It is calculated as the area under the precision-recall curve, which is a plot of precision (the ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions) against recall (the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives) at various threshold settings. In the context provided, the AUPRG is reported for different combinations of λ1 and λ2 parameters in the Full weighted loss, as well as for the SSDL loss, SLDS loss, and Full loss. The best and second-best mean AUPRG in each column are highlighted in bold and underlined, respectively.

It is worth noting that the model's architecture and training parameters are also provided in the context. The model consists of four layers, each containing 512 neurons and connected with residual connections. Batch normalization and the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function are employed in all layers except the final one, where a sigmoid function is used to enable multi-label classification. The model is trained with a batch size of 256 for 30 epochs using the AdamW optimizer, with a learning rate and weight decay of 0.0001. A learning rate scheduler with exponential decay of 0.95 and dropout are also employed.
