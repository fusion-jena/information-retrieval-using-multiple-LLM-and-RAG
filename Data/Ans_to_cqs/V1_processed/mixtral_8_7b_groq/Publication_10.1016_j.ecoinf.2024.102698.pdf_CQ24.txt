Deep learning models, including those used for generating synthetic data, employ various strategies to handle randomness in the training process. One common method is the use of a random seed value.

A random seed value is a starting point for the random number generator in a model. By setting a specific seed value, the sequence of random numbers generated by the model becomes reproducible. This is particularly useful in deep learning for ensuring that the training process can be repeated with the same results, which is important for model validation and comparison.

In the context of the initial coral cover data model, the TVAE model from SDV uses a random seed value to initialize the weights of the neural network. This helps to ensure that the model's training process is reproducible and that any randomness introduced during training is controlled.

Additionally, deep learning models often use techniques such as dropout and batch normalization to further control randomness during training. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of the model's inputs or weights to zero during training, which helps to prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize to new data. Batch normalization scales and shifts the inputs of each layer in the model to have zero mean and unit variance, which helps to improve the stability and convergence of the training process.

Overall, the use of a random seed value and other techniques such as dropout and batch normalization help to control randomness in the deep learning pipeline and improve the reproducibility and stability of the training process.
