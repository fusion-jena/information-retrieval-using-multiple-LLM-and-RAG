The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions that a ResNet-50 deep convolutional neural network was used, which was developed and pre-trained using millions of label images. The training of the ResNet-50 model likely required significant computational resources, but the specific type of hardware (e.g., GPUs, TPUs) used for this training is not mentioned.

The classification model used in the study was a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a cubic polynomial kernel. This model was trained using the ResNet-50 fc1000 activations of the full training dataset. The training of this SVM classifier may have also required computational resources, but again, the specific type of hardware used is not mentioned in the context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model.
