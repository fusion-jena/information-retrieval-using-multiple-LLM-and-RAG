Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating which specific deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used to build the model. However, it is mentioned that a convolutional neural network (CNN) was used for landscape photograph analysis in one of the references (Tuia et al., 2019). CNNs are a type of deep learning model commonly implemented using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Another study mentioned in the context (Guo et al., 2023) constructed 3D landscape indexes based on oblique photogrammetry, but it does not explicitly state that a deep learning model was used.

In summary, while deep learning frameworks are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is possible that TensorFlow or PyTorch were used to implement the convolutional neural network for landscape photograph analysis.
