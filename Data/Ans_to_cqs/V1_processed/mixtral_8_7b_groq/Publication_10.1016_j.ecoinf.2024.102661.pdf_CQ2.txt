The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that one of the data formats used is likely to be CSV (Comma-Separated Values) or a similar tabular format, as the TPEBO-LSTM model is used for forecasting ACE (Agricultural Carbon Emissions) based on historical data for 31 provinces in mainland China, covering four main agricultural activities. This data would typically be organized in a structured, tabular format, such as a CSV file, with each row representing a data point and each column representing a feature.

Moreover, the context does not indicate the use of image, audio, or video data formats in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the given information, it can be concluded that the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are likely to include CSV or a similar tabular format.
