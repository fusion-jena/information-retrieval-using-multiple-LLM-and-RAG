In the context provided, there is no specific mention of the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for wetland mapping in Alberta, Canada. However, based on common practices in remote sensing and deep learning, data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are likely used to increase the amount of training data and improve the model's ability to generalize.

Flipping involves creating new training samples by horizontally or vertically flipping the original images. This technique can help the model learn invariance to the direction of features in the image, which can be useful in remote sensing where the orientation of features on the ground may vary.

Rotating involves creating new training samples by rotating the original images by a certain angle. This technique can help the model learn invariance to the orientation of features in the image and improve its ability to handle images taken from different angles.

Scaling involves creating new training samples by scaling the original images up or down. This technique can help the model learn invariance to the scale of features in the image and improve its ability to handle images taken from different distances.

These techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for remote sensing applications, and it is likely that they were used in the deep learning pipeline for wetland mapping in Alberta, Canada. However, the specific data augmentation techniques used in this study are not mentioned in the provided context.
