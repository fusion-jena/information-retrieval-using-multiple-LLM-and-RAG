The provided context discusses the use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for predicting water quality parameters using hyperspectral data. However, it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

Nevertheless, based on general knowledge and practices in machine learning, there are several techniques that can be used to address data bias during preprocessing, including stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique used to ensure that the training, validation, and testing datasets are representative of the overall dataset. This is particularly important in cases where the dataset is imbalanced, and certain classes are overrepresented or underrepresented. By stratifying the dataset, we can ensure that each subset contains a similar proportion of samples from each class.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to address class imbalance in the dataset. Oversampling involves creating additional samples from the underrepresented classes, while undersampling involves reducing the number of samples from the overrepresented classes. Both techniques can help to improve the performance of the machine learning algorithm by ensuring that each class is represented fairly in the training data.

Diverse data collection is a technique used to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population being studied. This involves collecting data from a wide range of sources, including different geographical locations, times of day, and weather conditions. By collecting diverse data, we can ensure that the machine learning algorithm is robust and can generalize well to new, unseen data.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, they are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning pipelines to address data bias and improve model performance. It is likely that these techniques could be applied to the preprocessing of hyperspectral data for water quality prediction.
