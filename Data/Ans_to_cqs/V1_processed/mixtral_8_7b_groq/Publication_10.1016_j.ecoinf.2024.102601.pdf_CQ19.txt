The provided context does not contain information about the use of deep learning models in the study. The focus of the text is on the optimization of a random forest (RF) algorithm for wildfire mapping using the scikit-learn library. The study employs RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization, but there is no mention of deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this question without additional context.
