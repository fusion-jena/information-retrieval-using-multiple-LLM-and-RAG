Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, there are some implicit indications that suggest the researchers might have employed some of these techniques.

Firstly, the model was developed to make day-ahead predictions of three pollutants, which implies that the dataset likely contains a variety of conditions and patterns that the model can learn from, contributing to its generalizability.

Secondly, the evaluation metric selected for the model was Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), which are common choices for regression problems. These metrics can help assess the model's performance on unseen data, indirectly addressing generalizability.

Thirdly, the context shows a plot of the model's training and validation losses against the number of epochs. This suggests that the researchers might have used a validation dataset to monitor the model's performance during training, which could indicate the use of techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, the context does not explicitly confirm this.

Lastly, the model's predictions for NO2 pollutant readings, as shown in Figure 13, are not too far off the actual readings. This could imply that the model has learned to generalize well to new data, but this is an indirect observation and not a direct confirmation of the use of techniques to enhance generalizability.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly state the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, there are some implicit indications that suggest the researchers might have used techniques like a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, without more information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
