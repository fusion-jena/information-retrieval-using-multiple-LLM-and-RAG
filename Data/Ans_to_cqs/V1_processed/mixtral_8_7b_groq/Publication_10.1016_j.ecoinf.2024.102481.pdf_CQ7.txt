The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does discuss the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques, specifically Random Forests (RF), to classify maturity in Chilean hake.

In ML, data splitting is a common practice used to evaluate the performance of a model and prevent overfitting. The data is typically divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's parameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

In the context provided, the authors used RF analysis to classify maturity in Chilean hake using histological staging as the gold-standard. They mentioned the importance of considering factors influencing the reproductive process and the need for analytical tools beyond the simple description of gonadal development. However, they did not mention any specific data splitting criteria used in their study.

Therefore, while the text discusses the use of ML techniques for classifying maturity in Chilean hake, it does not provide information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
