The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and left-right mirroring to reduce overfitting and improve the algorithm's capacity to match individuals based on pelt patterns.

In addition, the context mentions the use of a comprehensive graph matching software within the Wild Me software suite for cleaning data at a standard suitable for deep learning algorithms. This software is used for exhaustive rounds of ID decisions, where two images are placed side by side, and the observer determines whether the images are the same individual or different individuals.

While these techniques are important for the overall performance of the deep learning pipeline, they do not directly answer the query about the optimization techniques used. Optimization techniques are methods used to update the parameters of a model during training to minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance.

Some common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop. Without further information, it is unclear which of these techniques or others were used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context.

Therefore, while the context provides valuable information about the data augmentation and data cleaning techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it does not explicitly answer the query about the optimization techniques used.
