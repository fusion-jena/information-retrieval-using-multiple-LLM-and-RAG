Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for air pollution analysis and carbon monoxide prediction in Taiwan are not mentioned. However, it is mentioned that deep learning methods are used to create models directly from large volumes of complex data. Commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, CIFAR for image classification, and ImageNet for large-scale object recognition. These datasets are often used for benchmarking and comparing the performance of different deep learning models. Nonetheless, the context provided here focuses on the application of deep learning for air pollution analysis and carbon monoxide prediction, and it does not specify the datasets used in the pipeline.
