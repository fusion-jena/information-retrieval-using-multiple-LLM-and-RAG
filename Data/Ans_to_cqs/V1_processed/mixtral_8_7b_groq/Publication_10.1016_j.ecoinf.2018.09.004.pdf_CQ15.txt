The provided context does not include information about optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. The context focuses on machine learning algorithms, specifically the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, decision tree classifier, and feature selection techniques.

The k-nearest neighbors algorithm is a non-parametric lazy learning algorithm that does not make assumptions about the underlying data distribution or use training data points for generalization. It stores instances of training data and classifies a query point based on a simple majority vote of the nearest neighbors.

The decision tree classifier is a simple and widely used classification technique that poses a series of questions about the attributes of the test record to determine the class label.

Feature selection techniques are used to choose features by recursively considering fewer and fewer arrangements of features. The estimator is trained on the underlying arrangement of features, and the significance of each feature is acquired through some property. Less critical features are then pruned from the current arrangement of features. This method is recursively repeated until the desired number of features to choose is reached.

The context also discusses the use of macro-averaging and micro-averaging when computing the total F-measure. Macro-averaging takes the average of all individual class F-measures, treating small and large classes equally, while micro-averaging aggregates the TP/TN/FP/FN counts from all classes and computes a total measure biased towards large classes.

The experiments conducted in the study involved using subsets of the best features from the top 50% down to the top 5% with a step of 5%, and the effectiveness maximized at using the top 10% of features. The best F-measure score was achieved by Random Forest with 39.7%, a 2.6% improvement compared to the all-features experiment.

Therefore, based on the provided context, optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as SGD or Adam, are not discussed.
