The code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study is not explicitly provided in the context. However, it is mentioned that the code and methods were based on the BirdNET-Analyzer repository located at <https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer>. It is possible that the specific code and modifications used in this study are stored in a different or private repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
