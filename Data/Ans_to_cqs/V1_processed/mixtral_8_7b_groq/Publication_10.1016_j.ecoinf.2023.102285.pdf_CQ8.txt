The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The sources mentioned in the context are research papers, theses, and books that discuss various methods and techniques for detecting and classifying man-made objects in different environments, including underwater and marine settings. However, none of these sources provide information about a specific code repository on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

In some of the papers, like Han et al. (2022), the authors propose deep learning models for detecting and classifying marine man-made objects using remote optical imagery. While they explain the architecture and the training process of their proposed model, they do not share the actual implementation code in the paper or provide a link to a code repository.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query, as the required information is not available in the given context.
