The provided pieces of context do not contain information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. There is no mention of any deep learning pipeline or a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context mainly discusses the comparison of different methods for ecological informatics, including "indiv" (individual), "CoinF" (coin flipping), "knn" (k-nearest neighbors), "LoopT" (loop transition), and "CF" (conditional filtering), and their performance in retrieving the initial process with 80% of hidden observations. The methods were tested with and without lasso regularization and bias correction. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested information.
