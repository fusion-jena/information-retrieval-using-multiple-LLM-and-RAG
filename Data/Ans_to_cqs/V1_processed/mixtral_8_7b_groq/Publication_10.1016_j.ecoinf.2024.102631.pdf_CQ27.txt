The context provided does not give detailed information on the specific steps taken to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model's high-performance speed makes it well-suited for real-time applications, implying that deployment has occurred.

From the context, we can infer that the model deployment might have involved model serialization, which is the process of converting the trained model into a format that can be stored and loaded again. This could be in the form of a .h5 file for Keras models or a .pth file for PyTorch models.

However, the specifics about the platform used for deployment are not mentioned in the context. It could be a local machine, a cloud-based platform, or an edge device. The context also does not mention any details about model optimization for deployment, such as model quantization or pruning, which are often used to make models run faster and use less memory.

In summary, while the context indicates that the model has been deployed and is being used in real-time applications, it does not provide specific details about the process of deployment, including model serialization, platform selection, and model optimization.
