Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the assessment of atmospheric correction (AC) models for remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) in plateau lakes (PL) using in situ data.

However, in general, training of machine learning or deep learning models is considered complete when the validation loss reaches a plateau or stops decreasing significantly. This indicates that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data and is unlikely to improve further by continuing the training process. This criterion helps to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model becomes too specialized to the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data.

In the context of the study, the authors use several metrics to evaluate the performance of the AC algorithms, including the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination (R²). These metrics are calculated for each algorithm and band, and the results are presented in a scatterplot (Fig. 3). The scatterplot shows the estimated Rrs (λ) against the in situ Rrs (λ) for each algorithm, allowing for a visual comparison of their performance.

Therefore, while the specific criterion for determining when training is complete is not provided in the context, it is common practice to use a validation loss plateau or a similar criterion to prevent overfitting and ensure the generalizability of the model.
