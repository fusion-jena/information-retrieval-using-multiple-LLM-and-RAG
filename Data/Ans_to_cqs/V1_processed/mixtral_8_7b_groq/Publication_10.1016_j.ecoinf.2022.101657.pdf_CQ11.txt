The provided context does not give a direct answer to the query regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the authors have used a curated subset of 330 videos from the GBIF database for their research. These videos are shot with static cameras and have been manually annotated to indicate whether or not they contain an animal. The training and validation split used for tuning parameters and evaluating the system has also been provided.

It is important to note that camera-related parameters have not been annotated or used in testing the DynAIkonTrap. For these tests, the authors have assumed the focal length for all cameras to be the same as that of the RPi camera module.

Therefore, while the specific data repository link is not provided, the context suggests that the authors have used a subset of videos from the GBIF database for their research.
