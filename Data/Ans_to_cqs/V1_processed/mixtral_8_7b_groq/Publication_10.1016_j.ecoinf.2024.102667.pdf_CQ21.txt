Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, the context does provide information about a study related to land use/cover change and gross soil nitrogen (GSN) changes in China. I will describe some postprocessing steps that could be relevant in a similar study.


In a study analyzing land use/cover change and GSN changes, postprocessing steps after model training could include:

1. **Saliency Maps**: Saliency maps can be used to visualize the importance of input features for the model's predictions. In the context of this study, saliency maps could highlight the most influential land use/cover types or pixels contributing to the GSN changes.

2. **Metrics Calculation**: Various metrics can be calculated to evaluate the performance of the model. These metrics could include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Cohen's kappa coefficient. For a regression problem like predicting GSN changes, metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared could be used.

3. **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix can be created to assess the performance of a classification model. The matrix shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, from which other metrics can be calculated.

4. **Error Analysis**: Analyzing the errors made by the model can provide insights into potential improvements. This could involve comparing the predicted GSN changes with the actual values and identifying any systematic errors or outliers.

5. **Uncertainty Quantification**: Estimating the uncertainty of the model predictions can be important, especially for decision-making purposes. Techniques like bootstrapping or Bayesian methods can be used to quantify the uncertainty.

6. **Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis**: Since the study focuses on spatial data, analyzing the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals can be useful to ensure that the model accounts for the spatial dependence in the data.

Please note that these postprocessing steps are just examples and might not be directly applicable to the study mentioned in the context.
