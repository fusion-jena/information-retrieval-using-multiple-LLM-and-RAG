Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. The PLUS model, which is a significant focus of the context, uses the random forest algorithm for land use development probability calculations and not a deep learning model.

However, it is worth noting that hyperparameters are crucial for deep learning models, such as learning rate, optimizer, batch size, and number of epochs. The learning rate determines the size of the steps in the gradient descent, while the optimizer is the method used to update the weights in the right direction. Batch size refers to the number of training examples used in one iteration, and the number of epochs is the total number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information on the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. Hyperparameters are indeed important for deep learning models, but their values depend on the specific model, dataset, and problem at hand.
