The provided pieces of context do not contain information about the platform used to deploy the deep learning model, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The first piece of context discusses a study comparing unbiased models to corrected models in the context of species distribution models (SDMs), but it does not mention any deep learning models or cloud platforms. The second piece of context is a paper that also discusses SDMs, focusing on the impact of sample size and scarcity of species records. Again, there is no mention of deep learning models or cloud platforms. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot answer the query about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
