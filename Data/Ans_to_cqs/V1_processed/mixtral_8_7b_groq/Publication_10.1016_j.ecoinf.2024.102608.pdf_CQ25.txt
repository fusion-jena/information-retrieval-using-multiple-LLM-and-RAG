Based on the provided context, the specific purpose of the deep learning model in this study is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is being used for regression analysis, as it is being trained and evaluated using metrics such as the coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). These metrics are commonly used for evaluating the performance of regression models, which predict continuous numerical values.

The deep learning model in this study is an artificial neural network (ANN), which is a type of deep learning model that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. ANNs are composed of interconnected layers of nodes or "neurons," and they can learn complex patterns in data by adjusting the weights and biases of these connections.

The ANN in this study is being used to predict three different water quality parameters (chlorophyll-a, Secchi depth, and total suspended solids) using remote sensing data from Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI sensors. The ANN is being trained and evaluated using a training and test set approach, and its hyperparameters are being tuned using randomized grid search methods to strike a balance between model complexity and the dataset.

In summary, while the specific purpose of the deep learning model in this study is not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the model is being used for regression analysis to predict continuous numerical values of water quality parameters using remote sensing data.
