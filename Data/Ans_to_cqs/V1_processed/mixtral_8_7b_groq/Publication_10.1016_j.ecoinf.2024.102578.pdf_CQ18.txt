Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, the context does provide information about the performance metrics used to evaluate the model's performance on the test data.

The "caret" R package was used to calculate the performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics were calculated for the image quality model, as shown in Table 5, and for the false positive model, as shown in Table 7.

For the image quality model, the precision and recall were calculated for each location (Finnmark and Yamal) and for each class (Bad and Good). The F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, was also calculated. The highest F1 score for the image quality model was 0.987, indicating a high level of accuracy in classifying images as either "Bad" or "Good."

For the false positive model, the precision, recall, and F1 score were calculated for each location and for each class. The "No animal" class, which combines the Empty, Bait, Bait_yamal, and Rock model classes, had the highest F1 score of 0.985 in Finnmark, indicating a high level of accuracy in identifying images without animals.

While the context does not provide information on the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training, it does show that various performance metrics were calculated to evaluate the model's performance on the test data. These metrics can be used to monitor the model's performance during training by comparing the performance on a validation set to the performance on the training set. If the performance on the validation set is significantly worse than the performance on the training set, it may indicate overfitting, and the model may need to be adjusted.

Therefore, while the context does not provide direct information on the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training, it is possible that performance metrics were used to monitor the model's performance during training.
