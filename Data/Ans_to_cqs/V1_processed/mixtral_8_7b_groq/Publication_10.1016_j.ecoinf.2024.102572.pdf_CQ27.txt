Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. The text mainly discusses the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Python's Direct Application Programming Interface (API) to process data related to forest fires.

However, it can be inferred that the researchers likely used a local environment or a cloud-based platform to train their deep learning model, as GEE and the Python API are primarily used for data retrieval and preprocessing. Once the model was trained, they might have serialized it (saved the model's architecture and learned parameters) using a format compatible with their chosen deployment platform.

For deployment, they could have used various options, such as:

1. A local server or workstation: In this case, they would have deployed the model by loading the serialized model and using it to make predictions on new data.
2. A cloud-based platform: They could have deployed the model on cloud platforms like Google Cloud, AWS, or Microsoft Azure. These platforms offer services that simplify the process of deploying and scaling machine learning models.

In summary, while the provided context does not offer specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the researchers used a separate platform or local environment for training and deploying their model after serializing it.
