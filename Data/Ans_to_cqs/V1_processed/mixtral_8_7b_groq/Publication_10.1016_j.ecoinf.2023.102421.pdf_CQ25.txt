Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, the context does mention that the training dataset has 39 features and is used for training machine learning models such as XGBoost and LightGBM. These models are typically used for regression and classification tasks.

The context also mentions that the training dataset is divided into two parts, with 80% used for training/validation and the remaining 20% kept as unseen data for testing. This is a common practice in machine learning to evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data.

Furthermore, the context mentions that the performance of XGBoost-TDO and LightGBM-TDO appears to be the same. This suggests that both models have similar predictive capabilities, which could be indicative of a classification or regression task.

However, the context does not mention any specific deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are typically used for tasks such as image segmentation, object detection, or time series forecasting.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific purpose of the deep learning model. It could be used for a regression or classification task, but further information is needed to make a definitive conclusion.
