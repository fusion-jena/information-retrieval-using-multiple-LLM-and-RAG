Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the methodology for constructing a deep learning model for classifying sound sources in audio data, but it does not mention where the data or model are stored. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
