The context does not provide explicit information on the model serialization or platform selection for the deployed deep learning model. However, it does mention that the implementation of the classification methods, including the deep learning model, was carried out in Python using the libraries TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. This implies that the deep learning model was likely serialized using one of the serialization techniques supported by TensorFlow, such as the TensorFlow SavedModel or the Checkpoint formats, to save the model's architecture, learned weights, and biases for later use.

As for the platform selection, the text does not provide specific details about where the model was deployed. TensorFlow models can be deployed on various platforms, including local machines, cloud services, and edge devices, depending on the use case and the required resources. Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer regarding the platform used for deploying the deep learning model in this case.
