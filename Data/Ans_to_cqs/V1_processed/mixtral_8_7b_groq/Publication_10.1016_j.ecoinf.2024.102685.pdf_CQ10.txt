Based on the provided context, there is no information available about a deep learning pipeline or any code repository link related to it. The context discusses the use of Random Forest (RF) models for mapping seagrass habitats using multispectral images. However, it does not mention any deep learning techniques or code repositories. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a deep learning pipeline.
