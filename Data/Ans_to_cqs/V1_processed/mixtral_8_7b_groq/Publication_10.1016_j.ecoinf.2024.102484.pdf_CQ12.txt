The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the study by Huang et al., 2019. The study focuses on monitoring ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen by the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning. However, it does not specify the type of deep learning model employed in their pipeline.

The study could have used various deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, or other architectures depending on the specific requirements of their research. CNNs are commonly used for image analysis tasks, RNNs for sequential data, and Transformers for handling long-range dependencies in data.

Without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer regarding the type of deep learning model used in this study.
