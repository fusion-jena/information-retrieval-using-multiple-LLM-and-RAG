The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for land use and land cover (LULC) classification from satellite images are not mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that several benchmark datasets were used for comparisons of methods to classify LULC from satellite images.

It is also mentioned that deep learning techniques were used for the LU detection task and outperformed XGBoost, with DenseNet and DeepLab being the best performing "single-pixel" and "semantic labeling" architectures, respectively. The architectures were trained with stochastic gradient descent using a similar protocol, and neural networks were found not to perform well when trained with unbalanced data sets.

In addition, several methods were tried to control the number of pixels per class for "semantic labeling," but negligible differences in performance were found. The median frequency balancing method was used for all reported experiments.

Therefore, while the specific datasets used are not mentioned, it can be inferred that they are likely benchmark datasets for satellite image classification and that they were preprocessed to have balanced data sets for training the deep learning models.
