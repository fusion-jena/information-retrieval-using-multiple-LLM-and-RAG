Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of machine learning models, including their implementation for water quality prediction.

In the context of machine learning model training for water quality, it is noted that analyzing historical trends in water quality is necessary to find the most variable and representative scenarios. This suggests that some form of data selection or preprocessing may have been done to create a diverse and representative dataset for training the models.

Additionally, the context mentions the issue of overtraining when working with larger datasets. While it does not explicitly state that cross-validation was used, the mention of this issue implies that some form of model validation or regularization technique may have been employed to prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

However, without more specific information, it is not possible to definitively say which measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.

 The provided context does not contain explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it suggests that some form of data selection, preprocessing, and model validation or regularization technique may have been used.
