In the deep learning pipeline, the methods used for collecting raw data can vary depending on the specific application or study. However, in the context of the study about wild bird detection in camera traps, the authors used camera traps as the data collection method. Camera traps are sensors that capture images or videos when triggered by motion or heat. They are commonly used in ecological studies for monitoring wildlife populations.

In this study, the authors used camera traps to collect a dataset of images of 15 wild bird species in Chinaâ€™s Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park. The dataset, named NTLNP dataset, contains 9717 images and was used to evaluate the performance of eight deep learning algorithms for bird object detection.

The use of camera traps as a data collection method in this study has several advantages. First, camera traps can operate unattended for long periods, allowing for the collection of large amounts of data over time and wide areas. Second, camera traps can capture images of wildlife in their natural habitats, providing valuable information about their behavior and ecology. Third, the use of camera traps reduces the need for manual data collection, which can be time-consuming and costly.

Other studies have also used camera traps as a data collection method in deep learning pipelines. For example, the SNAPSHOT USA 2019 study used camera traps to collect a dataset of images representing 20 species of mammals in the United States. The NACTI dataset, used in a study by Norouzzadeh et al., 2021, contains camera trap images of 520 species of wildlife in North and South America. The Europe Birds dataset, used in a study by Chalmers et al., 2023, contains camera trap images of 20,000 bird species in Europe.

In addition to camera traps, other methods for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines include surveys, public datasets, and other types of sensors. The choice of data collection method depends on the specific application or study and the availability of data.

In summary, the study about wild bird detection in camera traps used camera traps as the data collection method. Camera traps are sensors that capture images or videos when triggered by motion or heat and are commonly used in ecological studies for monitoring wildlife populations. Other studies have also used camera traps as a data collection method in deep learning pipelines, as well as surveys, public datasets, and other types of sensors.
