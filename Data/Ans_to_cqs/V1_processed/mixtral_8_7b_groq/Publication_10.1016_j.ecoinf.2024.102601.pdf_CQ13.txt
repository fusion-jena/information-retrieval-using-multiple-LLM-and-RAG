Based on the provided context, the question asks about the hyperparameters in a deep learning model, but the context discusses the optimization of a Random Forest (RF) algorithm using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV from the scikit-learn library. There is no mention of any deep learning models or their hyperparameters in the context.

Therefore, I cannot provide the hyperparameters for the deep learning model as they are not mentioned in the given context. However, I can list some common hyperparameters for deep learning models:

1. Learning rate: It determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function.
2. Optimizer: It updates the weights and biases based on the gradient of the loss function. Common optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), RMSprop, and Adam.
3. Number of layers and number of neurons per layer: These define the architecture of the deep learning model.
4. Activation functions: They introduce non-linearity in the model, such as ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh.
5. Regularization techniques and hyperparameters: L1, L2, or dropout regularization can help prevent overfitting.


The provided context does not contain information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. However, some common hyperparameters for deep learning models include learning rate, optimizer, number of layers and neurons, activation functions, and regularization techniques.
