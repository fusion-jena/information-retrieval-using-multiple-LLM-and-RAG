The provided context does not directly discuss data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. However, it does contain information about various methods and indices used in remote sensing and geospatial analysis, which can involve data annotation.

In the context of remote sensing and geospatial analysis, data annotation techniques may include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a bounding box around an object of interest in an image. It is used to identify and locate objects within an image, which can help train deep learning models for object detection tasks.
2. Pixel-level annotation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image according to the class or object it belongs to. It is used for semantic segmentation tasks, where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image.
3. Instance segmentation: This technique combines object detection and semantic segmentation. It involves identifying and segmenting individual instances of objects within an image.

In the provided context, the Linear Time Segmentation (LTS) method is mentioned, which is a technique used for time-series analysis of remote sensing data. The LTS method involves segmenting a time series into multiple segments, each with a different slope or trend. This method can be used to analyze changes in vegetation or land cover over time.

Additionally, various remote sensing indices are mentioned in the context, such as NBR (Normalized Burn Ratio), NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index). These indices are used to analyze vegetation health, moisture, and biomass. Annotation techniques may be used to label pixels or regions of interest in remote sensing images to calculate these indices.

Overall, while the provided context does not directly discuss data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, it does provide information about remote sensing and geospatial analysis methods that may involve data annotation.
