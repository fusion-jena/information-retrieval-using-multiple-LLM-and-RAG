Based on the provided context, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used in the pipeline for bat acoustic signal detection. The network is called CNNFAST, and it consists of two convolution layers, each followed by a max pooling layer, and ending with a fully connected layer. The input to the network is a spectrogram, and the output is a probability vector indicating the presence of a search-phase bat call at every instance of time in the spectrogram. The network is designed to be computationally efficient and faster than real-time, making it suitable for processing large quantities of data generated in passive acoustic monitoring.
