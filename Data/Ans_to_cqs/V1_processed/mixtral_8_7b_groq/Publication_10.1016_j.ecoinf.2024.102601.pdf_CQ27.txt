Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, it can be inferred that the model was trained using Random Forest algorithm, and hyperparameters were optimized using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV from the scikit-learn library.

The training dataset was created using the dNBR (delta Normalized Burn Ratio) model and S2 (Sentinel-2) imagery in a systematic three-step process. The study focused on optimizing data structures for WSM (Wildfire Spread Modeling) using ML (Machine Learning) classification, specifically selecting the 12 most relevant predictors from S2 imagery.

The evaluation of the model's performance was carried out using two primary metrics: OA (Overall Accuracy) and Cohen's Kappa statistic. These metrics are crucial for understanding the model's effectiveness, particularly in the context of wildfire mapping where precision is critical.

However, the context does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, such as converting the model into a format that can be executed on a target platform, selecting a platform for deployment (e.g., cloud-based, on-premises), or integrating the model with other systems or applications. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query based on the given context.
