The provided context does not contain information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on data mining, Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), and data processing techniques.

Data mining is the process of discovering knowledge from databases by identifying patterns or relationships within a dataset. KDD is a broader process that includes data mining and other actions required to reach the final result. The KDD sequence consists of several steps, such as identifying the aim for a specific study area, pre-selecting useful data, making analytical determinations, and optimizing and elaborating the obtained results.

Data mining can be supported by various data processing techniques, such as verifying or interpreting results. The process can be automated using open-source software without an operator who reprocesses the data each time.

In summary, while the provided context contains valuable information about data mining and Knowledge Discovery in Databases, it does not mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
