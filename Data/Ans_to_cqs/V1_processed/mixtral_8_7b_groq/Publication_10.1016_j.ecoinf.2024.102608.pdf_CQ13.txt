The provided context discusses the hyperparameter tuning process for various machine learning models, including a deep learning model (Artificial Neural Network), to predict water quality parameters using remote sensing data. However, the specific hyperparameters for the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned in the text.

The table (Table 1) presents the hyperparameters obtained after tuning each machine learning model for CHL-a, SD, and TSS. For the Artificial Neural Network model, the table lists the hyperparameters related to the Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, AdaBoost models.

However, the text does mention that the hyperparameters for the deep learning model were optimized using a randomized grid search, similar to the other models. The hyperparameters considered for the other models include learning rate, number of estimators, loss, hidden layer sizes, activation, solver, and alpha. It is possible that some of these hyperparameters were also optimized for the deep learning model.

In conclusion, while the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is likely that some hyperparameters such as learning rate, hidden layer sizes, activation, solver, and alpha were optimized during the hyperparameter tuning process using a randomized grid search. Nonetheless, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
