Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning model being used in the study. The models that were employed in the study are specified as an ensemble modeling approach using an ensemble of four different models, including one regression-based model (Generalized Linear Model or GLM) and three machine-learning models (Maximum entropy, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines). The purpose of these models is to predict the distribution of the study species. The models were tested for performance using cross-validation, and the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) was used as the index to specify the accuracy of the models. The AUC scale ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, where a higher AUC value indicates that the model is more accurate.

Therefore, I cannot answer the query about the purpose of the deep learning model as there is no information provided about it in the context.
