The provided context discusses the process of acquiring and filtering data from Twitter for a study on biodiversity observations. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.

That being said, some of the described steps in the data acquisition and processing pipeline could be used to address data bias. For instance, the use of the 'Full-archive search endpoint' to access the entire dataset published on Twitter since its beginning in 2006-2007 allows for a more diverse and representative sample of tweets. Additionally, the use of the twarc2 library to handle the data in JSON format returned by the Twitter API simplifies the handling of quota limits imposed by the Twitter API, which could help ensure that the dataset is not biased towards tweets from users who are more active or have more followers.

Furthermore, the initial filtering step of eliminating tweets that contain images in GIF format could help reduce bias by excluding memes and other non-serious content that may not be representative of the population of interest. Similarly, the use of supervised data available at a specific URL could help ensure that the dataset is representative of the population of interest if the data was collected in a diverse and unbiased manner.

In terms of specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, the context does not provide enough information to determine whether any of these techniques were used. However, some possible techniques that could be used include:

* Stratified splitting: This involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain characteristics (e.g., age, gender, location) and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to ensure that the training, validation, and test sets are representative of the population of interest.
* Oversampling: This involves increasing the number of examples from underrepresented subgroups in the dataset to ensure that they are adequately represented in the training, validation, and test sets.
* Undersampling: This involves reducing the number of examples from overrepresented subgroups in the dataset to ensure that they do not dominate the training, validation, and test sets.
* Diverse data collection: This involves collecting data from a wide range of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population of interest in terms of demographics, geographic location, and other relevant factors.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, some of the described steps in the data acquisition and processing pipeline could be used to reduce bias. Additionally, specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection could be used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.
