The provided context does not explicitly name the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the test dataset was obtained from soundscape recordings, which are usually much noisier than focal recordings. This suggests that the dataset used in this study is related to soundscape or focal recordings, as opposed to more commonly named datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

In addition, the study uses mixed audio clips that are converted into spectrograms as input images for model training. This means that the dataset likely consists of audio recordings that have been transformed into visual representations.

The study also cites several other papers that use various datasets for bird sound classification and segmentation. For example, Zhang et al. (2019) use a spectrogram-frame linear network and continuous frame sequence for bird sound classification. Garamszegi (2019) uses an open-source deep-learning object detection method for automatic bird song and syllable segmentation. These studies suggest that there are datasets specifically used for bird sound classification and segmentation.

Overall, while the provided context does not explicitly name the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, it suggests that the dataset is related to soundscape or focal recordings and consists of audio recordings that have been transformed into visual representations. Additionally, there are likely datasets specifically used for bird sound classification and segmentation.
