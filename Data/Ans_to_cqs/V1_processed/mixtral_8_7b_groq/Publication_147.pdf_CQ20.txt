The deep learning model, specifically the segmentation convolutional neural network (CNN), was trained on a desktop with 64 GB of RAM and one Titan X (Maxwell) GPU. This information is derived from Table 2, which provides a full comparison of training time, prediction time, optimization time, and hardware for each model used in the study. The use of a GPU for training the deep learning model is consistent with the typical practice of using powerful computational resources to handle the complex computations and large datasets involved in deep learning.
