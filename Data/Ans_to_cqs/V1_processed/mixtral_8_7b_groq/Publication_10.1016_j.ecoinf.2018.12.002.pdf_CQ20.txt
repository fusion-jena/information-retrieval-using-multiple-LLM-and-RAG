The provided context does not contain specific information about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The text discusses the use of machine learning algorithms, including neural networks, for inferring animal behavior from location and movement data. However, it does not mention any details about the computational hardware used for training these models.

In general, deep learning models require significant computational resources, and training such models is often performed on specialized hardware, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) or tensor processing units (TPUs). These hardware resources can accelerate the training process and enable the use of larger and more complex models.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give a specific answer to the query, it is reasonable to assume that hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs would be used for training a deep learning model for inferring animal behavior from location and movement data.
