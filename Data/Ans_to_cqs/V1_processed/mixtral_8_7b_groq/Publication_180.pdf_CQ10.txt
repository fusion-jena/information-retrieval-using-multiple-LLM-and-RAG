I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions the use of TensorFlow for deep learning research and applications in the context of Triatominae species identification, as well as discussing the challenges faced due to small sample sizes and the validation method. However, it does not offer a link to the code repository.
