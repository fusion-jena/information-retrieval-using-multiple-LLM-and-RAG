The provided context does not contain specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline for audio denoising applications. However, based on general knowledge of deep learning, common regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting include dropout, L2 regularization (also known as weight decay), and data augmentation.

Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent over-reliance on specific neurons and encourages the model to learn more robust features. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights and promotes a more even distribution of importance across the model's parameters. Data augmentation involves creating new training examples by applying transformations (such as rotation, scaling, or adding noise) to the existing data, which can help the model generalize better to unseen data.

While the context does not explicitly mention these regularization techniques, it does discuss the challenges of training deep noise reduction models, such as the need for large amounts of data and the potential errors introduced during spectrogram conversion. These challenges could be addressed in part by using regularization techniques to improve the model's generalization and prevent overfitting.
