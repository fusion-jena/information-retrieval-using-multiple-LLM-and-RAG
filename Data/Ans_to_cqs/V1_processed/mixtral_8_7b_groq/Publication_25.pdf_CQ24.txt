The provided context discusses the application of deep learning to natural systems, specifically for tree detection in remote sensing, but it does not directly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline such as the use of random seed values. However, it does discuss the use of "self-supervised learning" and "semi-supervised learning" as strategies to handle the lack of high-quality training data in remote sensing.

Self-supervised learning is a method that uses unsupervised methods to generate training data that is then used to train supervised models. This approach has been applied to remote sensing for hyperspectral image classification. It can be combined with labeled data in a semi-supervised framework, which allows neural networks to learn generalized features on a wider array of training examples, followed by retraining on a smaller number of high-quality annotations.

It is unknown whether moderate to low-quality annotations can be used to generate trees for initial model training, given the imperfect nature of existing unsupervised tree delimitation approaches. However, it is mentioned that applying deep learning models to natural landscapes can be done while using unsupervised detection to produce generated trees for pretraining the neural network.

In summary, the context provided discusses strategies for handling the lack of high-quality training data in remote sensing, such as self-supervised learning and semi-supervised learning, but it does not directly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline such as the use of random seed values.
