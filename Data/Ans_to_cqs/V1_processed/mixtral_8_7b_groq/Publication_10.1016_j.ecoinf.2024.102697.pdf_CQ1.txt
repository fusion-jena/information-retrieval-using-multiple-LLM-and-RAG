Based on the provided context, the specific details of the data collection methods used in the deep learning pipeline are not given. However, we can infer that remote sensing observations and wastewater treatment plant data are used in the studies mentioned.

In the study by Zhang et al. (2023), the authors used a deep learning-based data-driven model for detecting time-delay water quality indicators of wastewater treatment plant influent. This suggests that the data used in this study were collected from wastewater treatment plants, although the specific methods of data collection are not mentioned.

On the other hand, Zheng and Jia (2022) evaluated different methods for soil heat flux estimation at large scales using remote sensing observations. Therefore, it can be inferred that remote sensing technologies were used to collect data in this study. Remote sensing involves the use of satellite or aerial sensors to measure various physical and chemical properties of the Earth's surface, such as land surface temperature, vegetation cover, and soil moisture.

Moreover, the study by Cross et al. (2024) used explainable machine learning techniques for soil heat flux estimation. While the data collection methods are not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that remote sensing observations and other relevant data sources were used to train the machine learning models.

Therefore, while the specific data collection methods are not provided in the context, it can be inferred that remote sensing observations and wastewater treatment plant data were used in the studies mentioned. Other possible data collection methods for deep learning pipelines include surveys, experiments, and public datasets. The choice of data collection method depends on the research question, the availability of data, and the appropriate measurement techniques for the variables of interest.
