The text provided gives information on how the deep learning model was trained, but it does not explicitly mention the steps taken to deploy the trained model. However, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized and then run on a different dataset for evaluation.

To begin with, the model was trained using transfer learning, where the initial layers of the model were initialized with pre-trained weights from the ImageNet dataset. This allowed for the use of a smaller training dataset and reduced training time. The model was trained twice, once on a subset of 498 images for 9000 iterations and then again on all 653 annotated images for 18000 iterations.

After training, the model could have been serialized, which is the process of saving the trained model to disk so that it can be loaded and used later. This is often done using a format such as HDF5 or JSON. Serialization allows for the model to be easily deployed to a different platform or used in a different application.

Once the model was serialized, it was then run on a new dataset of 708 full-scale herbarium scans from the Herbarium Senckenbergianum (FR) to evaluate its performance in predicting plant organs. This dataset consisted of images with an average size of ca. 9600 by 6500 pixels, which is larger than the training dataset. This suggests that the model was able to handle larger images than those it was trained on, indicating that it had been successfully deployed.

However, the text does not provide information on the specific platform or environment that the model was deployed to. It could have been deployed to a local machine, a cloud-based platform, or integrated into a larger application.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the steps taken to deploy the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized and then run on a different dataset for evaluation. The model was able to handle larger images than those it was trained on, indicating that it had been successfully deployed. However, the specific platform or environment that the model was deployed to is not mentioned.
