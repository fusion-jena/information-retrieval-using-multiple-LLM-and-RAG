I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the use of deep learning for identifying Collembola species in agricultural soils, the creation of a new dataset for model training, and the comparison of the leading model's performance with human experts. However, it does not mention or provide the link to the code repository. If you can provide more context or information, I would be happy to help you further.
