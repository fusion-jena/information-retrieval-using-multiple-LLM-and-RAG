The context provided does not explicitly list the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention that during training, hyperparameters are fine-tuned using a validation set consisting of 13% of the data (607 images). This process helps prevent overfitting and ensures the model's generalization. Common hyperparameters in deep learning models include learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and choice of optimizer (e.g., stochastic gradient descent, Adam, RMSprop). The specific values and choices of these hyperparameters depend on the model architecture, dataset, and training strategy and are not specified in the context.
