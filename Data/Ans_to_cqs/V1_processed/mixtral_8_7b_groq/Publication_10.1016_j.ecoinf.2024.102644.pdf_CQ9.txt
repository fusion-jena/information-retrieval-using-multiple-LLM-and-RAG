The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available on the Zenodo platform. It is part of the ITINERIS Critical Zone Virtual Research Environment, which is accessible on the D4Science e-Infrastructure. The repository contains all data and scripts used in the project, including ESRI-GRID raster files, tables, images, animations, and data-manipulation scripts. It is organized as a step-by-step process in subsequent folders and includes the list of species used to estimate species richness and the complete set of observation records. The data and scripts are continuously updated on the platform. To access the repository, free registration to the platform and the Virtual Research Environment is required.

Additionally, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) repository is also mentioned in the context, which is a taxonomic and observation data provider involved in several data FAIRness initiatives. However, it is not explicitly stated that the deep learning pipeline's data repository is available on GBIF.

Therefore, the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available on the Zenodo platform, which is part of the ITINERIS Critical Zone Virtual Research Environment on the D4Science e-Infrastructure.
