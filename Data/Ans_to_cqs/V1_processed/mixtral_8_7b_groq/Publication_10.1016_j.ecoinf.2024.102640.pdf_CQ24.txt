The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a random seed value in the context of the SegFormer model used in GreenCam for measuring photo Green Visual Index (GVI). Specifically, the SegFormer model uses a random seed value to initialize its weights during training.

In addition, the context provides information about various deep learning models and techniques that could potentially employ strategies for handling randomness. For example, the use of dropout regularization, which randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero during training, is a common technique used in deep learning models to prevent overfitting and introduce randomness. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or any other specific strategy for handling randomness.

Furthermore, some of the models mentioned in the context, such as ResNet and MobileNet, use batch normalization, which standardizes and normalizes the inputs to each layer of the model. Batch normalization can help reduce internal covariate shift, which is the change in the distribution of inputs to each layer due to the training of the previous layers. By reducing internal covariate shift, batch normalization can help make the training process more stable and less sensitive to randomness.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of a random seed value and alludes to potential strategies such as dropout regularization and batch normalization. However, further investigation would be needed to determine the specific strategies employed by each model or technique mentioned in the context.
