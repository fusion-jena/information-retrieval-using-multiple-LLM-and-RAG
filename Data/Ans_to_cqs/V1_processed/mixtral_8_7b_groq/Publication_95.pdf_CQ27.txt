Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, the context does provide details about the training process of the deep learning models.

The training procedure involved adapting the final classification layer to match the seven classes, including six IAPS (Invasive Alien Plant Species) and "no species." The networks were trained on five different image sizes, and for each image size, a network was trained using either random weights or weights pre-trained on ImageNet. Additionally, global max pooling or global average pooling was applied before the final classification layers.

As for model deployment, there are several common steps that are typically taken, although they are not mentioned in the provided context. These steps may include:

1. Model serialization: Once the model has been trained and validated, it is typically saved to disk as a file. This file can then be loaded into memory and used for making predictions on new data.
2. Platform selection: The trained model can be deployed on various platforms depending on the use case. For example, it can be deployed on a local machine for batch processing, or on a cloud platform for real-time predictions.
3. Model optimization: Depending on the platform, the model may need to be optimized for performance. This can involve techniques such as quantization, pruning, or distillation.
4. Integration with other systems: The deployed model may need to be integrated with other systems, such as a web application or a mobile app. This can involve building an API or a user interface for interacting with the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it does provide information about the training procedure. The deployment process typically involves model serialization, platform selection, model optimization, and integration with other systems.
