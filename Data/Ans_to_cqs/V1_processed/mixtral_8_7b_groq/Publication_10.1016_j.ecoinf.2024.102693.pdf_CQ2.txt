The deep learning pipeline can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV data.

Images are a common data format in deep learning, particularly in computer vision tasks. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are typically used for image processing and analysis. In the context provided, ResNet-50, ViT-S/16, and Volo-d1 are examples of models used for image-based tasks. ResNet-50 is a CNN-like model, while ViT-S/16 and Volo-d1 are transformer-like models that have been adapted for image processing.

Audio data is also used in deep learning, particularly in tasks related to speech recognition, music information retrieval, and audio event detection. In such cases, deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are often employed.

Video data, which is essentially a sequence of images, can be processed using 3D CNNs or a combination of 2D CNNs and RNNs. Video data can be used in various applications, such as action recognition, object detection, and video summarization.

CSV data, which typically contains tabular data, can be processed using deep learning models designed for structured data. For instance, deep learning models based on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) can be used for regression or classification tasks with CSV data. In the context provided, ViP-Small/7 is an example of an MLP-like model that can process image data represented as token embeddings, which could be derived from a CSV file containing image metadata.

In summary, deep learning models can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV data. The choice of model depends on the specific task and the nature of the data.
