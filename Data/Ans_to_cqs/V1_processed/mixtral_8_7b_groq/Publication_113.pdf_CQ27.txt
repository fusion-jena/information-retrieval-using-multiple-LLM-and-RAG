The text provided does not give detailed information on the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that a deep neural network was trained on a large dataset and then fine-tuned on a target dataset. The model was used as part of an active learning procedure, where it was trained on a small, randomly selected labeled set of data samples. After training the initial model, various criteria were employed to select the most informative unlabeled samples to be passed to the oracle for labelling. This process was repeated until the stopping criteria were met.

In terms of model serialization, the text does not provide specific details. However, it is mentioned that the model achieved 93.2% overall accuracy after the first 30,000 active queries, which suggests that the model's performance was evaluated and recorded at various stages of the active learning process.

As for platform selection, the text does not provide any information on where or how the model was deployed. It is possible that the model was deployed on a local machine for the purpose of the active learning procedure, but this is not explicitly stated in the text.

Therefore, while the text provides some information on the training and evaluation of the deep learning model, it does not give detailed information on the process of deploying the model.
