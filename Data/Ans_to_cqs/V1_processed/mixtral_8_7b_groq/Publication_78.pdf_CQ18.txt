The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the coral bleaching classification model is evaluated using various metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1-score, and Cohen's Kappa. These metrics are calculated based on the confusion matrix, which is a table that summarizes the predictions made by the model.

The confusion matrix consists of four values: true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN). TP represents the number of instances where the model correctly predicted the corals as bleached, while TN represents the number of instances where the model correctly predicted the corals as unbleached. FP represents the number of instances where the model incorrectly predicted the corals as bleached, while FN represents the number of instances where the model incorrectly predicted the corals as unbleached.

Using these values, the model performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

* Sensitivity (TPR) = TP / (TP + FN): It measures the proportion of actual bleached corals that are correctly identified by the model.
* Specificity (Sy) = TN / (TN + FP): It measures the proportion of actual unbleached corals that are correctly identified by the model.
* Accuracy = (TN + TP) / (FP + TP + FN + TN): It measures the proportion of total correct predictions made by the model.
* F1-score = 2 \* (TPR \* Sy) / (TPR + Sy): It is the weighted mean of sensitivity and specificity.
* Cohen's Kappa (Îº): It measures the agreement between the predicted and actual values, taking into account the possibility of chance agreement.

These metrics provide insights into the model's performance and help in identifying any potential issues during training. However, the context does not mention any specific strategy for monitoring the model performance during training. It is possible that the model performance was monitored using these metrics at regular intervals during the training process.
