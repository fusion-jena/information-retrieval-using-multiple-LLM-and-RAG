The provided context does not give information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for identifying bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings. The CNN model used is a ResNet50 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The training data preprocessing involves preparing equally sized input images with a time-frequency window size of 2 seconds. However, it does not mention any details about the deployment platform.
