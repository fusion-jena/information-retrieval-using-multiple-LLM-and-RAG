The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the LaDeco model are optimized. There is no information regarding techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other method for hyperparameter tuning. The text does mention that LaDeco uses a pre-trained deeplabv3 + resnet269 model, which suggests that some hyperparameters may be inherited from this pre-trained model. However, the context does not confirm this and does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion. Therefore, the specific method of hyperparameter optimization for the LaDeco model remains unknown based on the provided information.
