Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is object detection. More specifically, the model is a Mask R-CNN model that is built using Python 3 and PyTorch. The Mask R-CNN model is a popular choice for object detection tasks as it can not only detect objects in an image but also segment the pixels that belong to each detected object.

The Mask R-CNN model consists of three main parts: the backbone, the region proposal network (RPN), and the head. The backbone is typically a ResNet-50, which is responsible for extracting features from the input image. After the ResNet-50, a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is used to detect objects at different scales. The RPN is used to propose regions in the image that might contain objects, and the head is used to classify the proposed regions and refine the object boundaries.

In the context of the provided information, the Mask R-CNN model is pretrained on the COCO 2017train dataset for object detection. Additionally, the model is used as the backbone for the FGFA (Feature Pyramid Network and Flow Guided Feature Aggregation) architecture, which is used for video object segmentation. During the training process of FGFA, only the head and the RPN of the Mask R-CNN model are trained, while the backbone is kept frozen.

Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning model is object detection, and it is used as the backbone for the FGFA architecture for video object segmentation.
