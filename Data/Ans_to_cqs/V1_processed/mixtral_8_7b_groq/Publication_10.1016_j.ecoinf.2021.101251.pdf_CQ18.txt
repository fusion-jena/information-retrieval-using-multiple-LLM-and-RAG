I don't have enough information to directly answer the query about the strategy implemented to monitor model performance during training. However, I can provide some context from the given pieces of information that might be relevant to monitoring model performance in similar research contexts.

The context describes ESS-DIVE, a data repository for the Department of Energy's Energy Science & Engineering (ESS) program. Researchers submit data packages from projects like AmeriFlux, NGEE-Tropics, and WFSFA for long-term stewardship. Data papers, which go through the peer-review process, can be used to increase the prestige and usability of these data packages. These papers often provide context, processing details, and other information that could be relevant to model performance monitoring.

In the context of modeling research using data from ESS-DIVE or similar repositories, monitoring model performance during training typically involves using validation techniques to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data. Common strategies include:

1. **Data splitting**: Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. Monitor the model's performance on the validation set during training to ensure it generalizes well and doesn't overfit the training data.

2. **Cross-validation**: Divide the dataset into 'k' subsets. Train the model 'k' times, each time leaving out one of the subsets for validation. This method provides a more robust estimate of model performance and helps avoid overfitting.

3. **Learning curves**: Monitor the model's performance on the validation set as the amount of training data increases. If the performance continues to improve as more data is added, it suggests that the model could benefit from more training data.

4. **Early stopping**: Stop training when the model's performance on the validation set stops improving or begins to degrade. This can help prevent overfitting.

5. **Regularization**: Techniques like L1 and L2 regularization can be used to reduce overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function.

6. **Model complexity control**: Choosing the right model complexity is crucial for good generalization. Techniques like pruning, dropout, or using simpler models can help improve model performance and prevent overfitting.

While the context does not provide specific details about the strategy used to monitor model performance during training for a particular project, the mentioned techniques are commonly used in modeling research and could be applied in this context.
