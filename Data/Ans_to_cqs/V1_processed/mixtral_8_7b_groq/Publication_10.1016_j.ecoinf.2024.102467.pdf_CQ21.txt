Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The text discusses the design of a backbone to improve the training speed of a model while reducing its complexity and ensuring detection accuracy. It also mentions that the algorithm significantly reduces model complexity and shortens the inference time on a specific hardware setup. However, it does not specify any details about postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore,


The provided context does not include information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.
