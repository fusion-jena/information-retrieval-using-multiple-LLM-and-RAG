In the research context provided, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline involve the use of IoT (Internet of Things) devices. Specifically, temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate concentration sensors are employed to gather real-time data about the water quality in aquaculture environments. This approach allows for a more precise, timely, and cost-effective means of monitoring water quality compared to traditional methods. By leveraging these IoT-based sensors, the study can collect large amounts of data to be used in the deep learning model, which helps in accurately classifying water contamination levels. It is important to note that the specific public datasets or surveys were not mentioned in the provided context.
