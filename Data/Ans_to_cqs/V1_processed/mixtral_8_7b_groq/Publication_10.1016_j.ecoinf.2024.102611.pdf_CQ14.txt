The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model, such as grid search or random search. However, it does provide information about the fixed hyperparameters used in the Random Forest classifier.

The number of estimators (decision trees) N is set to 100, and the random state is set to 5. Each decision tree is allowed to grow until all leaf nodes contain only samples of the same class, and the number of samples at the leaf node is set to 1.

Additionally, the data collection is split into eleven groups based on visual morphological characteristics, and each group consists of several plant species varieties. The data is split into training, validation, and testing proportions of 70:20:10 in both levels, except for the GSL100 datasets. Two new datasets, RTL80 and RTP40, are used to assess the efficiency of the proposed hierarchical classification model.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the use of grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization, it does describe a systematic approach to splitting the data and fixing hyperparameters for the Random Forest classifier.
