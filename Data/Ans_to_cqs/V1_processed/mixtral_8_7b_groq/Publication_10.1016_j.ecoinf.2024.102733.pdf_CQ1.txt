The provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a few datasets that are used in the experimental analysis of deep learning models.

One of the datasets is a genetic algorithm-based synthetic minority over-sampling technique for improved imbalanced data classification (Syldorff et al., 2021). This dataset is likely generated synthetically using a genetic algorithm, rather than collected through surveys or sensors.

Another dataset mentioned is a deep learning-based method to identify and count pelagic and mesopelagic fishes from trawl camera images (Allken et al., 2021). This dataset is collected using trawl camera images, which suggests that sensors or cameras are used to collect the raw data.

The context also mentions the use of SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features) (Bay et al., 2006) and a method for coding Kendall's shape trajectories for 3D action recognition (Ben Tanfous et al., 2018). These methods are used for feature extraction and action recognition, respectively, and do not directly relate to the collection of raw data.

Finally, the context mentions the use of the ICES J. Mar. Sci. and IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision datasets (Bay et al., 2006; Bergmann et al., 2019). However, the context does not provide information on how these datasets were collected.

In summary, while the provided context does not give a comprehensive answer to the query, it suggests that sensors or cameras may be used to collect raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, synthetic datasets can be generated using genetic algorithms, and pre-existing datasets can be used for experimental analysis.
