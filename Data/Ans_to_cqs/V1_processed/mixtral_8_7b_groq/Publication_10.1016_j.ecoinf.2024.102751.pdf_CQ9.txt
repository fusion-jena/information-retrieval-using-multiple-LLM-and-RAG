Based on the provided context, there is no information available about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository for it. The context mainly discusses a study that explored the development of a spatial modeling for estimating volumetric water content (VWC) on a reclaimed spoil heap. The study used remote sensing data (PlanetScope satellite imagery) and topographic indices for the model. However, there is no mention of any deep learning pipeline or a data repository for it.

The context does mention the possibility of testing more advanced methods of data analysis for estimating soil moisture, such as machine learning or deep neural networks. However, there is no information provided about the implementation or data repository for such a pipeline.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as there is no information available in the provided context.
