The initial step in a deep learning pipeline is data collection. The context provided describes the collection of raw data using a KaKaXi fixed camera that captures images every hour within a fixed period each day. These images are then saved in a database. This method of data collection is through the use of sensors.

In addition to sensors, other methods for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines include surveys and public datasets. Surveys can be used to gather specific data that meets the requirements of a study or project. For instance, in the context of computer vision, surveys can be used to collect images or videos of particular scenes, objects, or actions.

Public datasets are another common source of raw data for deep learning. These datasets are often created and maintained by research institutions, tech companies, and other organizations. They can contain a wide variety of data types, such as images, videos, audio recordings, and text. Some popular public datasets for computer vision include ImageNet [1], COCO [3], PASCAL VOC [15], and KITTI [16]. These datasets are used by researchers and developers worldwide for training and testing deep learning models.

It is important to note that the choice of data collection method depends on the specific requirements of the deep learning pipeline. Factors such as the type and amount of data needed, the availability of public datasets, and the resources available for data collection will influence the decision.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines include sensors, surveys, and public datasets. The context provided describes the use of sensors for data collection, while surveys and public datasets are also commonly used methods.
