Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, the document does discuss some preprocessing steps related to data preparation.

The context describes the use of the Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter for denoising time series data, particularly in the context of vegetation index time series. This filter is used to preserve the shape and width of the time series curve while effectively filtering noise, accurately capturing the changing trend of vegetation index time series, and retaining local mutation information in the vegetation growth process. This can be seen as a way to ensure the quality of data used in the deep learning pipeline.

However, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, which are often used to address data bias, are not mentioned in the context. Stratified splitting is a method used to ensure that each subset (e.g., train, test, validation) is a good representative of the whole population. Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to handle class imbalance in datasets. Diverse data collection is a strategy used to gather data from various sources or under different conditions to ensure the data's representativeness and reduce bias.
