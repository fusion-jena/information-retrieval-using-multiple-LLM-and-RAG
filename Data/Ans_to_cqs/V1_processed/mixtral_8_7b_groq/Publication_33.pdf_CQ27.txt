Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the specific steps taken to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, we can infer that the model was trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a training dataset (T0) consisting of images and labels, specifically fish individuals and their corresponding species (Figure 2a). After training, an independent dataset (T1) was used for each species to define a threshold for the classification score based on the user's goal of achieving a balance between accuracy and the proportion of images fully processed (Figure 2b). This threshold was then used to post-process the outputs of the CNN model (Figure 2c).

The context also mentions the use of Tensorflow, a system for large-scale machine learning (reference 43), which suggests that the model was likely trained and deployed using this framework. Tensorflow provides functionalities for model serialization, which involves saving the trained model to disk, and can be used for deployment on various platforms. However, the specific details of this process are not provided in the context.

Therefore, while the context provides information about the training and threshold tuning phases of the model, it does not explicitly mention the steps taken to deploy the trained deep learning model.
