Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer that the model was likely serialized and then integrated into a program or software for use.

First, the model was trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm. The training set had a separate metadata .csv file, which contained the metadata for the training set as opposed to the metadata for the entire dataset. This file was used to list the file path to the folder containing the bird song, with each folder labeled with the dialect type and the year it was collected.

After the model was trained, it was likely serialized, which means that the model was saved to a file in a format that can be reloaded and used later. This allows for the model to be easily deployed and integrated into a program or software.

As for the platform selection, the context does not provide information on where the model was deployed or the specific platform used. However, it is mentioned that the program saves all human classified data and labels, which can be used to retrain the network. This suggests that the model was integrated into a program or software that allows for human interaction and data input.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, we can infer that the model was likely serialized and integrated into a program or software for use. However, the specific platform used for deployment is not mentioned in the provided context.
