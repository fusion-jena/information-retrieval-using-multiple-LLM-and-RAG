Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The authors discuss the use of the deep learning algorithm Mask-RCNN for quantitative analysis of soil bacterial communities, but they do not provide a link to the code repository. If you are interested in the specific code implementation, I would recommend contacting the authors directly or looking for implementations of Mask-RCNN in platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
