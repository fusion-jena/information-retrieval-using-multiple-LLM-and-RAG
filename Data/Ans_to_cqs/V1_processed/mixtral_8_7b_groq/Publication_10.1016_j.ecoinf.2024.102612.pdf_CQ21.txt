Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific postprocessing steps such as saliency map generation, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix computation after the model training phase. However, it does mention some steps that are taken after the model training and validation process.

After training the Deep Learning (DL) model using synthetic data, a few samples of real LiDAR point clouds are segmented to create a ground truth. This ground truth is used to validate the classifications made by the DL model. The best-performing model, in this case, the MS input data case of the SoftGroup semantic branch, is then used to infer these real LiDAR point clouds. These inferences are then taken as inputs for a decision tree scheme, presented in Section 2.5, where the final fuel models are retrieved.

In Section 4, it is mentioned that the classifications of real point clouds will be made using the MS-trained model, as it outperformed the previous models. The fuel type classifications will be more reliable with this model.

While these steps do not directly correspond to the postprocessing steps mentioned in the query, they do provide insight into the overall process followed after the model training phase. The focus seems to be on validating the model's performance using real-world data, refining the model's predictions using a decision tree scheme, and making reliable fuel model classifications.
