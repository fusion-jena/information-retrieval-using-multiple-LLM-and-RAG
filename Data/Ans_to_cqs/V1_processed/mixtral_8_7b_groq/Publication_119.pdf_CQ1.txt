The provided context discusses the use of a specific type of data, LiDAR data, and its fusion with deep learning techniques for land cover and crop type classification. However, it does not directly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I will provide a more general answer based on the information available in the given references.

Deep learning pipelines typically involve several steps, starting with data collection, followed by data preprocessing, model training, validation, and deployment. The data collection method can vary depending on the application domain and the type of data required. In the context of remote sensing and geospatial analysis, data collection often involves sensors and satellite imagery.

For instance, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances. It can be used to create high-resolution digital elevation models, which are useful for various applications, such as forest monitoring, urban planning, and autonomous vehicles (as mentioned in references [18] and [19]). LiDAR data can be collected using airborne or terrestrial platforms, depending on the spatial extent and resolution required.

In addition to LiDAR, other remote sensing techniques include multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, which capture reflected light in various wavelength bands. These data can be collected using satellite or airborne sensors, such as Landsat, Sentinel, or WorldView (as mentioned in reference [21]). Public datasets, such as those provided by NASA, USGS, or ESA, are also valuable resources for remote sensing data.

For non-remote sensing applications, data collection methods may include surveys, interviews, or public datasets. For example, in natural language processing or computer vision, data collection might involve scraping websites, using APIs, or accessing publicly available datasets, such as ImageNet (as mentioned in reference [20]).

In summary, the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline can vary widely depending on the application domain and the type of data required. In the context of remote sensing and geospatial analysis, data collection often involves sensors and satellite imagery, with techniques such as LiDAR, multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, and accessing public datasets.
