The provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The CRediT authorship contribution statement lists the contributions of each author, including methodology, investigation, formal analysis, and conceptualization, but it does not mention any code repository. Similarly, the Declaration of competing interest and Data availability sections also do not provide any information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide the code repository link based on the given context.
