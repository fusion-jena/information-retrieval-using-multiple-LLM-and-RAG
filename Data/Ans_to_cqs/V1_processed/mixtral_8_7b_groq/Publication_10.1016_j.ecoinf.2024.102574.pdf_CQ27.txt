Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. However, there are several studies that have used deep learning techniques for various applications in the field of remote sensing and ecology.

For instance, Liu et al. (2022) used a neural network to guide the interpolation of canopy height maps of China's forests by integrating GEDI and ICESat-2 data. However, the text does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Similarly, Marrs and Ni-Meister (2019) used machine learning techniques for tree species classification using co-registered LiDAR and hyperspectral data, but there is no information on the deployment process.

In general, the process of deploying a deep learning model involves several steps, including:

1. Model serialization: This involves saving the trained model in a format that can be easily loaded and used for making predictions. Common formats include HDF5, JSON, and XML.
2. Platform selection: The choice of platform for deploying the model depends on the intended use case. For instance, if the model is to be used for real-time prediction in a web application, a cloud-based platform such as AWS or Google Cloud may be appropriate. On the other hand, if the model is to be used for offline prediction, a local machine or server may be sufficient.
3. Model optimization: Depending on the platform, it may be necessary to optimize the model for efficient deployment. This may involve techniques such as quantization, pruning, or distillation.
4. Integration with other systems: The deployed model may need to be integrated with other systems, such as databases or user interfaces, for seamless operation.

Therefore, while there is no specific information on the process followed to deploy a deep learning model in the provided context, it is likely that the researchers followed a similar process involving model serialization, platform selection, optimization, and integration with other systems.
