I am unable to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline as it was not included in the context. However, based on the information given, it is clear that the researchers have developed a deep learning model for real-time species recognition, which demonstrates significant improvements in terms of FPS, model parameters reduction, FLOPs reduction, and model loading time.

The model advances deep learning in ecology by balancing efficiency with performance, and the techniques used include a parallel connection (Fig. 5), depth-wise separable convolution (Fig. 6), and MobileNetV2 convolutional blocks with different strides (Fig. 7). The paper also mentions the use of PANet and BiFPN for the neck networks (Fig. 8).

Given that the paper was published in Ecological Informatics and the authors are from various institutions, it is likely that the code repository has been shared via a platform such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. To find the code repository, you may try searching for the authors' names or the paper title along with keywords like "GitHub" or "code repository." Additionally, you could contact the authors directly to inquire about the code repository.

Another approach would be to look for any related repositories in the authors' profiles or institutions' repositories. For instance, some of the authors have published other papers with code repositories available on GitHub. You may find the following links helpful:

While these repositories may not contain the exact code for the species recognition model, they can serve as a starting point for understanding the authors' code structure and practices.
