The context provided does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that satellite imagery is one of the primary sources of data in this context, as it is repeatedly mentioned and forms the basis of the land monitoring system being discussed.

Satellite imagery can be considered a type of remote sensing, which involves the acquisition of information about the Earth's surface and atmosphere through the use of sensors placed on satellites. This method allows for the collection of data over large areas and is particularly useful for monitoring changes in land cover over time.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of "national-scale field" data in the creation of land-cover maps, suggesting that field surveys may also be used to collect raw data. Field surveys involve the direct observation and measurement of features in the environment and can provide detailed and accurate information.

In addition, it is possible that public datasets are used in the deep learning pipeline. Public datasets can be a valuable resource for researchers, providing access to large amounts of data that have already been collected and processed. These datasets can save time and resources, as researchers do not need to collect and process the data themselves.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that satellite imagery, field surveys, and public datasets are likely to be used.
