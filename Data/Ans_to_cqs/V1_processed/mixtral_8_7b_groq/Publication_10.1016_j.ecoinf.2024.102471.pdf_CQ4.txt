The provided context discusses the architecture and components of various deep learning models, but it does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the pipeline. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot specify the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling. However, these techniques are commonly used in deep learning to increase the diversity of training data and improve model performance. Flipping involves horizontally flipping images, Rotating involves rotating images by a certain angle, and Scaling involves changing the scale of images. These techniques can help the model generalize better and be more robust to variations in the input data.
