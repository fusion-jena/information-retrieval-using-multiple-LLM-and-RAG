Based on the provided context, there are no specific criteria mentioned regarding when training is complete for a machine learning model, such as validation loss plateau. The context focuses on various studies related to vegetation, remote sensing, and machine learning, but none of them explicitly discuss training completion criteria for machine learning models.

In general, there are several common criteria used to determine when training is complete in machine learning:

1. Validation loss plateau: Training stops when the validation loss (or error) does not decrease for a certain number of epochs or iterations, indicating that the model has likely learned the underlying patterns in the training data.

2. Early stopping: This technique involves monitoring the validation loss during training and stopping the training process if the validation loss starts to increase, preventing overfitting.

3. Monitoring other metrics: In some cases, training may be stopped based on other metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score, depending on the specific problem and the desired outcome.

4. Reaching a predefined number of epochs or iterations: If computational resources are limited, training may be stopped after a predefined number of epochs or iterations, even if the validation loss has not plateaued.

5. Patience: Patience is a hyperparameter that defines the number of epochs to wait before stopping the training if the validation loss does not improve.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific criteria for determining when training is complete, common criteria include validation loss plateau, early stopping, monitoring other metrics, reaching a predefined number of epochs, and patience.
