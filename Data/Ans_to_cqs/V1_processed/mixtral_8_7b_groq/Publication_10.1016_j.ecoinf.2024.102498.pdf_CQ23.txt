The provided context does not contain information about any deep learning model used in the research. Therefore, I cannot directly answer the query regarding the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, I can provide some general measures that are commonly used to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.



The text provided focuses on the pixel-based classification approach using machine learning techniques such as CART, RF, GTB, and SVM within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. It does not mention any deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot directly answer the query regarding the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

However, some general measures to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model include:

1. Diverse dataset: Using a diverse and representative dataset is crucial to ensure that the model can generalize well to new, unseen data. This includes collecting data from various sources, locations, and conditions.
2. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance and generalizability of a model by dividing the dataset into training and validation sets. The model is trained on the training set and then evaluated on the validation set. This process is repeated multiple times with different splits of the data to obtain a more robust estimate of the model's performance.
3. Stratified splitting: Stratified splitting is a technique used to ensure that the training and validation sets have a similar distribution of classes. This is important when dealing with imbalanced classes, as it ensures that the model is exposed to a representative sample of each class during training.
4. Regularization: Regularization techniques, such as dropout and weight decay, are used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalizability of the model. These techniques add a penalty to the loss function to prevent the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data that may not generalize well to new data.
5. Early stopping: Early stopping is a technique used to prevent overfitting by monitoring the model's performance on the validation set during training. If the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade, training is stopped early to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, while the provided text does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, the above measures are commonly used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models.
