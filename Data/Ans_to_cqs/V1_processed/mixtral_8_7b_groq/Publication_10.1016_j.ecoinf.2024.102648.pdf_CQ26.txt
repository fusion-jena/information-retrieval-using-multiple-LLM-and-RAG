The provided context discusses various techniques used to improve the prediction ability of models and prevent overfitting, but it does not explicitly mention any methods used for addressing data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide specific techniques related to addressing data bias during preprocessing.

However, I can provide some general techniques used to address data bias, which can be applied during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline:

1. **Stratified sampling**: This technique ensures that the train and test datasets have approximately the same percentage of samples for each class as the original dataset. This is useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.
2. **Oversampling**: In this method, the minority class is increased by replicating samples from that class. This ensures that the model gets enough exposure to the minority class during training.
3. **Undersampling**: In this technique, the majority class is reduced by randomly selecting a subset of samples from that class. This helps balance the dataset by reducing the number of samples from the majority class.
4. **Diverse data collection**: Collecting data from various sources, domains, and conditions can help ensure that the dataset is representative and less biased.

These techniques can help reduce data bias during preprocessing, ensuring that the model receives a balanced and diverse dataset for training. However, the provided context does not contain specific information about these techniques being used in the described process.
