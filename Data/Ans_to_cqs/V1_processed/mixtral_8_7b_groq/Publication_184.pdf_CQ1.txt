The provided context does not give explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for fish tracking and counting. However, it does mention the use of an image dataset's annotation, which implies that the images were previously collected using some method.

In the paper "Fish tracking and counting" by Lumauag and Nava (2019), the authors used a dataset of underwater images containing fish. The images were annotated with the x, y coordinates, width, and height of the fish, which were then parsed to train the YOLO model. Data augmentation was also used to extend the amount of data.

Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's performance. However, these techniques do not collect new data but rather generate modified versions of the existing data.

In addition to the above, other methods for collecting raw data in fish tracking and counting could include surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Surveys could involve manual counting of fish by experts in the field. Sensors could include underwater cameras, sonar, or other devices that detect and record the presence of fish. Public datasets could be available from government agencies, research institutions, or other sources that have collected and shared data related to fish populations.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data, it is likely that a combination of methods such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets were used to collect the image data used in the deep learning pipeline for fish tracking and counting.
