Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps (e.g., normalization, scaling, cleaning) that are involved before training a deep learning model. However, there is some context about processing involving atmospheric correction using the Dark Object Subtraction 1 (DOS1) method, and combining remote sensing data with other types of data in modeling frameworks.


While the context does not directly mention preprocessing steps for deep learning models, it does refer to processing of remote sensing data. Specifically, it mentions the use of the Dark Object Subtraction 1 (DOS1) method for atmospheric correction. This suggests that some preprocessing of the data is being done to correct for atmospheric effects.

In addition, the context highlights the importance of combining remote sensing data with other types of data in modeling frameworks. This implies that the data may need to be preprocessed to ensure compatibility and efficiency in the modeling process.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific preprocessing steps for deep learning models, it does suggest that some preprocessing is being done to correct for atmospheric effects and ensure compatibility with other data types. Normalization, scaling, and cleaning are common preprocessing steps for deep learning models, so it is possible that these steps are being taken as well. However, without further information, it is not possible to say for certain which preprocessing steps are being used.
