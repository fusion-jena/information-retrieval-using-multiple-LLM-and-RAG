Based on the provided context, there is no information given about a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link for it on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The context mainly discusses an ecological study related to beekeeping and the use of a fuzzy inference system (FIS) for assessing suitable habitats. The FIS is implemented using a tree-based architecture with two input fuzzy systems, Prox-FIS and LCWT-FIS, and the output has five fuzzy sets for linguistic variables.

The context also includes references to various data sources from the Quebec government, such as address data, hydrographic network data, and a lidar data guide. There are also citations for scholarly articles related to the study. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it is not mentioned in the given context.
