The context does not provide specific information about how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves testing a predefined set of hyperparameter values, while random search randomly selects hyperparameter values within a specified range. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic model to find the most promising hyperparameter values to test next. Without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to this query.
