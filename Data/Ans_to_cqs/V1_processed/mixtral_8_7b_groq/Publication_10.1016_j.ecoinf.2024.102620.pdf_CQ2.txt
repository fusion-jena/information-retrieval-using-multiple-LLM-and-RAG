Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in this study utilizes several data formats, primarily raster-based remote sensing data and vector-based geographic data.

1. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data: The NDVI data is obtained from the MOD13Q1.006 dataset, which is an L3 image product with a spatial resolution of 250 m. The NDVI value is the monthly maximum value synthesized by the maximum value synthesis method. This raster-based data format is used to extract vegetation information.

2. Vegetation type data: The vegetation type data is reclassified into nine categories, including evergreen needle-leaved forest, deciduous needle-leaved forest, deciduous broadleaved forest, mingled forest, shrub, grassland, wetland, arable land, and non-vegetation. This categorical raster-based data format is used to derive land cover information.

3. DEM (Digital Elevation Model) data: The DEM data is obtained from the Resource and Environmental Science and Data Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, using the SRTM V4.1 dataset after resampling. This raster-based data format is used to extract topographical information.

4. Meteorological data: The temperature and precipitation data are provided by CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6) with a spatial resolution of 500 m. This raster-based data format is used to incorporate climate information.

5. Radiation data: The radiation data is obtained from the Copernicus Climate Data Store. This raster-based data format is used to include solar radiation information.

6. Road data and GDP (Gross Domestic Product) data: These vector-based data formats are obtained from OpenStreetMap and the Resource and Environmental Science and Data Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, respectively. They are used to incorporate anthropogenic factors into the model.

7. Population Data: This vector-based data format is also obtained from the Resource and Environmental Science and Data Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It is used to incorporate demographic factors into the model.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in this study utilizes various data formats, including raster-based remote sensing data (NDVI, vegetation type, DEM, meteorological data, radiation data) and vector-based geographic data (road data, GDP data, population data).
