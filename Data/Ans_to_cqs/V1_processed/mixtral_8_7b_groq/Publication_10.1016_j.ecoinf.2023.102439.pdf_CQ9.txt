Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, the text mentions the use of two specific datasets in the study: LST (Land Surface Temperature) dataset derived from MODIS-TERRA sensor and NDBI (Normalized Difference Built-up Index) data from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS.

The LST dataset was obtained from the MOD11A2 product, which offers 8-day temporal and 1 km spatial resolutions covering 2005-2018. Although the context does not specify where the data was obtained, the MOD11A2 product can be downloaded from the NASA Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC).

On the other hand, the NDBI data was used from 2014 to 2018, but the source of the data is not explicitly stated. However, Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS data can be obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Explorer website.

As for the deep learning pipeline, the context does not provide information on where the code and data are stored. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the data repository without additional information. It is recommended to contact the authors or look for the information in the related publication.
