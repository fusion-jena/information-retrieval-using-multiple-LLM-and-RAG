The provided context discusses the PLUS model, which uses the random forest algorithm for land use development probabilities, but it does not mention any preprocessing steps for deep learning models. However, I will provide a general answer based on common practices in the field of deep learning.


Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved, such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

1. Normalization: This process involves rescaling numeric data to a common range, often between 0 and 1. Normalization is useful for deep learning models because it can help improve model performance, reduce training time, and mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. Common normalization techniques include min-max scaling and z-score normalization.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling resizes features to a common range. However, scaling usually refers to adjusting features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This technique is particularly useful for models that are sensitive to the scale of the input features, such as those using distance or correlation measures.

3. Cleaning: Data cleaning is an essential step in preparing data for any machine learning model, including deep learning. Cleaning involves handling missing values, removing outliers, and correcting inconsistencies in the data. For deep learning models, cleaning is crucial because even a small number of outliers or inconsistencies can significantly impact model performance.

In summary, before training a deep learning model, it is common to normalize, scale, and clean the data. These steps help improve model performance, reduce training time, and ensure the quality of the input data. However, the provided context does not mention any specific preprocessing steps for deep learning models.
