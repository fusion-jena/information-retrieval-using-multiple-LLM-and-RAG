The provided context discusses various aspects of deep learning models used in fish recognition and underwater image processing but it does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general practices in deep learning, I can provide some common regularization techniques.

Regularization methods are essential to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization introduces a penalty on the model's complexity to prevent overfitting.

Two common regularization techniques are:

1. L1 and L2 regularization: These are also known as weight decay. L1 regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of the coefficients, while L2 regularization adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients. In both cases, the goal is to reduce the size of the weights, preventing the model from learning a more complex representation that may overfit the data.

2. Dropout: Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are "dropped-out"—i.e., their outputs are set to zero—during training. This prevents the neurons from co-adapting too much, leading to a simpler and more robust model. During inference, all neurons are used.

While the provided context does not mention these techniques directly, it does discuss other methods to improve and optimize deep learning models, such as pruning techniques (Pasandi et al., 2020; Pattanayak et al., 2021) and knowledge distillation (Polino et al., 2018 preprint; Gou et al., 2021). These methods can also help reduce overfitting indirectly by creating simpler models or transferring knowledge from larger models to smaller ones.


Based on the provided context and general deep learning practices, L1 and L2 regularization and dropout are common regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. These methods introduce penalties on the model's complexity or randomly drop neurons during training to prevent co-adaptation. The context also discusses other optimization methods, such as pruning techniques and knowledge distillation, which can help reduce overfitting indirectly.
