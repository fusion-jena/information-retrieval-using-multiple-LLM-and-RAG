The provided context does not explicitly mention which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the BEiT model's performance in plant disease classification, its challenges in computational efficiency and reliance on large datasets, and a comparative examination of various state-of-the-art models. However, it does not specify the cloud platform or any other deployment platform used. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query based on the given information.
