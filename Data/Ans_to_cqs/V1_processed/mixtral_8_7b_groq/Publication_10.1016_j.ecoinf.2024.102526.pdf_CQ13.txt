I don't have enough information to provide the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model as the provided context does not include any details about the model's architecture or training process. However, I can give you a general idea of some common hyperparameters used in deep learning:

1. Learning rate: This is a hyperparameter that controls how much the model's weights are adjusted with respect to the loss gradient during training. Common learning rate values include 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001.
2. Optimizer: This is a hyperparameter that determines the method used to update the model's weights during training. Common optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.
3. Batch size: This is a hyperparameter that determines the number of samples processed before updating the model's weights. Common batch sizes include 32, 64, and 128.
4. Number of epochs: This is a hyperparameter that determines the number of times the entire training dataset is passed through the model.
5. Regularization techniques: These are hyperparameters that help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Common regularization techniques include L1 and L2 regularization.
6. Dropout rate: This is a hyperparameter used in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that randomly sets a fraction of the input units to 0 during training, which helps prevent overfitting.
7. Image preprocessing techniques: These are hyperparameters that determine how the input images are preprocessed before being fed into the model. Common preprocessing techniques include resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.

These are just a few examples of hyperparameters that could be used in a deep learning model for image analysis. The specific choice of hyperparameters would depend on the details of the model and the dataset being used.
