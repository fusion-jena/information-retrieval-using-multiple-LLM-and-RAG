The context does not provide specific information about the deep learning framework used to build the model. However, it mentions the use of a ResNet50 model, which is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, and the AdamW optimizer. ResNet50 is a pre-trained CNN architecture available in several deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. The optimizer AdamW is also available in both TensorFlow and PyTorch. Therefore, it can be inferred that either TensorFlow or PyTorch (or potentially another deep learning framework) was used to build the deep learning model. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
