Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. The text focuses on the methodology and results of a land use and land cover (LULC) analysis in Kruger National Park (KNP), but it does not mention where the code for the deep learning pipeline can be found. The study uses Google Earth Engine and Random Forest for LULC classification, but the implementation details of the deep learning pipeline are not discussed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.

However, it is worth noting that the study's CRedit authorship contribution statement includes several papers related to remote sensing and machine learning, which could be useful for researchers interested in implementing similar deep learning pipelines for LULC analysis. For instance, Breiman (2001) introduces the Random Forest algorithm, which is used in this study for LULC classification. Conners et al. (1984) discuss a segmentation method for high-resolution Landsat data using Google Earth Engine and Random Forest. Trabucco and Zomer (2014) investigate the influence of aridity on vegetation, which could be relevant for LULC analysis in arid regions. Finally, Urban et al. (2020) map woody cover in the savanna ecosystem of KNP using Sentinel-1 C-band time series data, which could be useful for researchers interested in similar ecosystems.

In summary, while there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this study, researchers interested in LULC analysis can refer to the related papers mentioned above for guidance on implementing similar deep learning pipelines.
