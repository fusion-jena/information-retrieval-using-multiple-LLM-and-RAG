Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on describing the methodology, dataset, and results of a study on tree species segmentation using point clouds and deep learning. However, it does not mention where the code for the pipeline is available. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific answer to the query.
