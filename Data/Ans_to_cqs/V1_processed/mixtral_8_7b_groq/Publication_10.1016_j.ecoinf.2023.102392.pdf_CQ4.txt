Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The studies focus on the application of deep learning models, specifically the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, for various tasks such as land use/land cover classification, assessing the impact of flooding on endangered fish, and detecting the dispersal of butterfish. However, the details of the data augmentation techniques are not mentioned.

Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the size of the training dataset and improve model performance by providing more diverse data. Flipping involves horizontally or vertically flipping the images, rotating involves rotating the images by a certain angle, and scaling involves changing the size of the images.

While the specific data augmentation techniques used in the studies are not mentioned, it is possible that some of these techniques were applied to the remote sensing data used in the studies. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
