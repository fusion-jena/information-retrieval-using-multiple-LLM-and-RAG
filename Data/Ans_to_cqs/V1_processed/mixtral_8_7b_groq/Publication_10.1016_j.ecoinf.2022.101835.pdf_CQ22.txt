The performance of the machine learning models, including the deep learning model, is evaluated using several metrics. However, the specific metrics of accuracy, precision, and recall are not mentioned in the provided context. Instead, the models are evaluated using the loss function mean squared error (MSE), as well as the mean absolute error (MAE) and the coefficient of determination (R2) for reference.

For the deep learning model, the optimized models did not have any intermediate layers, and the model with the input layer followed by the output layer was determined to be the best. After calculating the first flowering and full blossom dates for each station and year using the optimized models, the root mean square error (RMSE) was calculated for all observation sites to evaluate the overall performance of the optimized models. The RMSE for each observation site was also calculated to evaluate the performance of the models for each site.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to understand the machine learning models. SHAP values are used to explain the output of a model by quantifying the importance of each input feature. Specifically, the average of the absolute SHAP values for each input variable is calculated, which represents the average contribution of that variable to the model's output. This information can be useful for interpreting the model's predictions and identifying important features.
