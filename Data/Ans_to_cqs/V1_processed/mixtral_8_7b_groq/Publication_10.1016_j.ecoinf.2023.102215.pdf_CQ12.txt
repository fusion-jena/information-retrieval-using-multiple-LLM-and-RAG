The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the use of U2-Net as the base network for feature extraction, which is a type of CNN specifically designed for salient object detection (SOD) applications. Additionally, the Multiscale Information Fusion (MIF) block, which is used in the feature extraction part of the model, is built using convolutional layers. The use of convolutional layers is further supported by the mention of ground-truth (G) and predicted saliency map (Spre) in the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss function, which are both 2D feature maps typically generated by convolutional layers. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
