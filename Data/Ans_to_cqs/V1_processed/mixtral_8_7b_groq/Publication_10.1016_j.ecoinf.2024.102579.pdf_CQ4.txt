Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context focuses on the use of inventory estimator, NN1, and NN2 estimators in the field of ecological informatics, specifically for continuous cover forestry.

The inventory estimator is defined as the sum of the product of individual tree heights and their corresponding weights, divided by the sum of the weights. The NN1 and NN2 estimators are not explicitly defined, but they are mentioned as being used to correct the inventory estimator.

The context also mentions the use of a dataset from a 2017 survey, but it does not provide any details about the data augmentation techniques applied before or during the training of a deep learning model.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
