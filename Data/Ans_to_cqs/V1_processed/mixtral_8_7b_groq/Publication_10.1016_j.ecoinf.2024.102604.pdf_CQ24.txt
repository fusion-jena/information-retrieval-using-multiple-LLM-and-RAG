The provided context does not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does offer insights into how randomness and bias are addressed in other areas of ecological modeling and data analysis, which can be relevant.

In ecological niche modeling, researchers have proposed methods to reduce sampling bias, which can be seen as a form of randomness. Boria et al. (2014) introduced spatial filtering to reduce sampling bias, improving the performance of ecological niche models. Castellanos et al. (2019) suggested environmental filtering as a means to enhance the accuracy of ecological niche models across multiple scales. These methods aim to minimize the impact of uneven sampling distributions on model performance.

In the context of spatial prediction and sampling, Xu et al. (2023a) presented a geographical similarity-based sampling method for non-fire point data. This approach considers the spatial relationships between data points, aiming to create a more representative and evenly distributed sample. Xu et al. (2023b) also discussed land-use change modeling with cellular automata, which can account for the stochastic nature of land-use changes.

Zhang and Zhu (2018) investigated the representativeness and spatial bias of volunteered geographic information (VGI) in environmental covariates. They identified observation station bias (OS bias) and road bias (RD bias) as potential sources of bias and mapped the environmental space to the geographic space to visualize the bias. They suggested that correcting sampling bias in environmental spaces could be beneficial but requires further testing.

Cosentino and Maiorano (2021) questioned whether geographic sampling bias is representative of environmental space. Their study highlights the importance of understanding and addressing bias in ecological data.

While these studies do not directly address the issue of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they emphasize the importance of accounting for bias and randomness in ecological modeling and data analysis. In deep learning, strategies such as setting a random seed value, employing cross-validation, and using dropout regularization can help manage randomness and improve model performance.
