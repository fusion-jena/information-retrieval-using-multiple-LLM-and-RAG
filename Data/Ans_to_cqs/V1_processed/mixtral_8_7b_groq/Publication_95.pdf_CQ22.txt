The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 

Accuracy is the most common metric and is defined as the number of images correctly classified out of the total number of images. It gives an overall idea of how well the model is performing.

Precision, on the other hand, measures the number of correctly classified images of a given class out of the total number of images that the model predicted as that class. It is useful when the cost of a false positive is high.

Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the number of correctly classified images of a given class out of the total number of actual images of that class. It is useful when the cost of a false negative is high.

The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a balance between the two metrics. It is a more balanced and robust metric than accuracy, especially when the class distribution is imbalanced.

In addition to these metrics, the performance of the model is also evaluated based on the frame rate (FPS) and the confidence threshold. The frame rate measures the number of images that the model can process per second, while the confidence threshold determines the minimum confidence level that the model must have in its prediction before it is considered a correct classification.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in the context of image classification, specifically for the ResNet50V2 and MobileNetV2 networks. The models are trained with different hyperparameters, such as input image size, weight initialization, and global pooling, and their performance is evaluated on a training set, validation set, and test set. The validation set is used to monitor the performance of the network during training and compare the performance of different networks, while the test set acts as a final evaluation of a network.

In conclusion, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of how well the model is performing and help in making informed decisions about the model's suitability for a particular task.
