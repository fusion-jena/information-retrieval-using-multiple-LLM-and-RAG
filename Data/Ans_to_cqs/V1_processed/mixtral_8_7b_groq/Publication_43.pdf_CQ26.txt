The provided context discusses data augmentation and transfer learning as techniques to address the limitation of a small labeled training set in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, it does not explicitly mention the strategies for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I will provide a general overview of some common techniques used to address data bias, including stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

1. Stratified splitting: Stratified sampling is a method used to ensure that the distribution of labels remains similar in both the training and testing sets. In stratified splitting, the original dataset is divided into subgroups based on the label distribution, and then equal-sized or proportionate random samples are taken from each subgroup to form the training and testing sets. This technique helps maintain the balance of classes and reduces bias in the model's performance.

2. Oversampling: Oversampling is a technique used to increase the representation of the minority class in the training dataset. This can be done by randomly duplicating samples from the minority class or by applying data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, scaling, or flipping, to create new synthetic samples. Oversampling helps the model learn more about the minority class and reduces the risk of overfitting.

3. Undersampling: Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the representation of the majority class in the training dataset. This can be done by randomly removing samples from the majority class or by using more advanced methods, such as clustering and ensemble learning, to identify and remove redundant samples. Undersampling helps balance the class distribution and reduces the risk of underfitting.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting a diverse dataset is crucial for reducing bias and improving the generalizability of the model. Diverse data collection involves gathering data from various sources, including different geographical locations, demographic groups, and environmental conditions. This helps ensure that the model is exposed to a wide range of variations and can learn to handle them effectively.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, common strategies include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These techniques help maintain label distribution, balance class representation, and expose the model to a wide range of variations, thereby reducing bias and improving the model's performance.
