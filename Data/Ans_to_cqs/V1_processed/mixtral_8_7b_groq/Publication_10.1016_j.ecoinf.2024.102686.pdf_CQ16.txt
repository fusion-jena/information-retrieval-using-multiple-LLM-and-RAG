The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context provided is not explicitly stated. The training of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is based on Eq. (4) in the text, which involves a learning rate Î·(t) that decreases with time t. The training process is repeated using a new input vector, but the specific condition for stopping the training is not mentioned.

In the case of Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) networks, the text mentions that changing the number of categories significantly affects the clustering results and determining the number of categories is the key. This suggests that the quality of clustering or the number of categories could potentially be used as a criterion for determining when training is complete.

Additionally, the concept of a validation loss plateau, which is commonly used as a criterion for determining when training is complete in machine learning models, is not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context provided is not explicitly stated, and it might be based on the learning rate or the quality of clustering, but the validation loss plateau is not mentioned.
