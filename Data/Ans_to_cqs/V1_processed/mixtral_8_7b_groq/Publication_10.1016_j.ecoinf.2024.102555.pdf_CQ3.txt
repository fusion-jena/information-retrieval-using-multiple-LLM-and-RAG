The provided pieces of context do not contain specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide a general overview of some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning.

In the context of computer vision, data annotation techniques are used to label and categorize images or video frames to train deep learning models. Some common data annotation techniques include:

1. **Bounding box annotation**: This technique involves drawing a rectangular box around an object of interest in an image. The box defines the object's location and size, and the object is typically labeled with a class label.
2. **Instance segmentation**: This technique involves labeling each pixel of an object of interest in an image. Each object is assigned a unique class label, and the resulting image shows the outline of each object.
3. **Semantic segmentation**: This technique involves labeling each pixel of an image with a class label. The resulting image shows the outline of each class, such as roads, buildings, or trees.
4. **Point annotation**: This technique involves labeling specific points in an image, such as the center of an object or a landmark.
5. **Line annotation**: This technique involves drawing lines to define the boundaries of objects or regions in an image.

These data annotation techniques are used to create labeled datasets that can be used to train deep learning models for various applications, such as object detection, image segmentation, and image classification. The choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific application and the type of data available.

Therefore, while the provided context does not contain specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, the above-mentioned techniques are commonly used in the field of computer vision and deep learning.
