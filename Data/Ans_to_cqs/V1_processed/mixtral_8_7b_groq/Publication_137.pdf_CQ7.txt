The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, as described in the provided context, is the hold-out method. In this method, the original data is divided into a test set and a training set at a ratio of 3:7. This means that 30% of the data is used for testing the model, and the remaining 70% is used for training the model. The test set and the training set are separated to ensure that the model's performance can be accurately evaluated on unseen data. This is an important step in the model training process as it helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model can generalize well to new data. The hold-out method is a simple and widely used technique for dividing data into training and test sets. However, other methods such as cross-validation can also be used for this purpose.
