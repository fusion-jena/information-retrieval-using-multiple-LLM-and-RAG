The performance of the deep learning model in classifying Landsat images was evaluated using four metrics: Producer's Accuracy (PA), User's Accuracy (UA), Overall Accuracy (OA), and Kappa Statistic (KS). These metrics are commonly used in image classification tasks to assess the quality of the classifications made by a model.

Producer's Accuracy (PA) measures the proportion of actual positive cases that were correctly identified by the model. It is a measure of the reliability of the model in identifying positive cases.

User's Accuracy (UA) measures the proportion of predicted positive cases that are actually positive. It is a measure of the precision of the model in identifying positive cases.

Overall Accuracy (OA) measures the proportion of all cases that were correctly classified by the model. It is a measure of the overall performance of the model.

Kappa Statistic (KS) is a measure of the agreement between the predicted and actual classifications, taking into account the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance. It provides a more robust measure of the performance of the model than Overall Accuracy alone.

These metrics were used to compare the performance of the deep learning model (SAE) with a traditional machine learning model (SVM) in classifying Landsat images. The results showed that the deep learning model achieved a higher Overall Accuracy and Kappa Statistic than the traditional machine learning model in classifying Landsat images in 2016-2017. However, the results were not as clear-cut in other years, with the traditional machine learning model sometimes achieving higher accuracy than the deep learning model.

In summary, the performance of the deep learning model in classifying Landsat images was evaluated using four metrics: Producer's Accuracy, User's Accuracy, Overall Accuracy, and Kappa Statistic. These metrics were used to compare the performance of the deep learning model with a traditional machine learning model, with the deep learning model achieving higher accuracy in some years and the traditional machine learning model achieving higher accuracy in others.
