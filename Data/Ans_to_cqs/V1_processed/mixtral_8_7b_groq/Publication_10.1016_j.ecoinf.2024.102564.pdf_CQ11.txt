Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link related to it. The context contains information about an article that uses machine learning methods, specifically the Random Forest algorithm, to model net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. However, it does not mention anything about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link for it. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
