The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, and area under the curve (AUC) score.

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. It is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model.

Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions (correctly predicted positive samples) to the total number of positive predictions. It measures the model's ability to identify positive samples correctly.

Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive samples. It measures the model's ability to identify all positive samples.

F1-Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which gives equal weightage to both precision and recall. It is a more balanced metric than accuracy, especially when the classes are imbalanced.

The AUC score measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative samples. It is a metric that is commonly used in binary classification problems.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model for both binary and multiclass classifications. The model optimization outcomes were derived using these performance criteria, and Model 1 exhibited the most favorable average performance outcome, with an 89.43% accuracy rate, 91.38% precision, 95.52% recall, and 0.816 F1-Score. The model performance was evaluated using stratified 10-fold cross-validation with calculated values of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, AUC score, confusion matrix, and model training time.
