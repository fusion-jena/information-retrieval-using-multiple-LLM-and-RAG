Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. The text mainly focuses on the use of a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) network for clustering and the creation of a human activity-natural endowment coupled zoning index system.

However, we can infer some general steps that might have been taken based on common deep learning deployment practices:


The deep learning model development process likely involved the following steps:

1. Data collection and processing: The text mentions data sources and preprocessing in Table 1 and Section 2.3. Data preprocessing included using ArcGIS 10.5 software for spatial data processing.

2. Model training: Although not explicitly mentioned, the deep learning model would have been trained using the equation and variables provided in the context. Equation (4) describes a learning rate (Î·(t)) that decreases over time and a neighborhood of the output neuron (Sk(t)). The learning rate and neighborhood are crucial for training a deep learning model.

3. Model evaluation: Again, this step is not explicitly mentioned in the context. However, model evaluation is an essential part of the deep learning process. Evaluation metrics would have been used to assess the model's performance.

4. Model serialization: After training and evaluating the model, the next step would be to serialize the model for deployment. Model serialization involves saving the model's architecture, weights, and biases in a file format that can be easily loaded and used for inference. The context does not provide information on this step.

5. Platform selection: The text does not provide information on the platform used for deployment. Common platforms for deep learning model deployment include cloud-based services (e.g., AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud AI Platform), on-premises servers, or edge devices.

In summary, while the context provides information on data collection, processing, and model training, it does not explicitly mention model serialization, evaluation, or deployment platform.
