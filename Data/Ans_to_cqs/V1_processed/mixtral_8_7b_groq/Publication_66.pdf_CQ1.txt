The raw data used in the deep learning pipeline for predicting animal behavior is collected through the use of GPS and Time-Depth Recorder (TDR) devices. These devices are attached to seabirds, specifically shags, guillemots, and razorbills, to collect location and dive profile data. The GPS devices record the location coordinates of the seabirds, while the TDR devices record the depth reached during dives. The locations where European shags, common guillemots, and razorbills were tracked using either GPS and TDR devices or just GPS devices are shown in Figure 1. An example of an interpolated GPS track collected from a single razorbill nesting on Colonsay Island off the east coast of Scotland is presented in Figure 2, with green dots indicating interpolated GPS locations and blue open circles indicating locations where dives were recorded by the TDR device. The combined information from GPS and TDR devices is then used to train deep neural networks to predict the diving behavior of these seabird species. This method of collecting raw data allows for the analysis of animal behavior in their natural habitats and provides insights into their foraging patterns.
