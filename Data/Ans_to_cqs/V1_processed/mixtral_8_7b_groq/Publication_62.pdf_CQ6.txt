The provided context discusses the architecture of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) used for classifying images of unstained and stained specimens, as well as clubmoss and spikemoss specimens. However, it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training the model.

However, based on common practices in deep learning, we can infer some preprocessing steps that might have been involved in this study. These steps include:

1. **Data Augmentation:** Data augmentation is a common technique used to increase the size of the training set and reduce overfitting. It involves creating modified versions of the original images by applying random transformations such as rotation, scaling, flipping, and cropping.
2. **Normalization:** Normalization is the process of scaling the pixel values of the images to a common range, typically between 0 and 1. This helps to ensure that all the input features are on a similar scale, which can improve the convergence of the training algorithm.
3. **Cleaning:** Cleaning the data involves removing any irrelevant or corrupted images from the dataset. This step is important for ensuring that the model is trained on high-quality data.
4. **Labeling:** In this study, the images are labeled with classes such as "unstained," "stained," "clubmoss," and "spikemoss." This step is necessary for training a supervised learning model.

It is also worth noting that the authors provide Mathematica notebooks and annotated notebooks as supplementary materials. These notebooks might contain more details about the preprocessing steps taken before training the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model, we can infer some common practices such as data augmentation, normalization, cleaning, and labeling. The supplementary materials provided by the authors might contain more information about the preprocessing steps taken in this study.
