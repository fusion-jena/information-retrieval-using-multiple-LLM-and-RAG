The provided context does not give information about the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. The sources cited are research papers and articles that describe various applications of machine learning and deep learning techniques in biological fields such as genetics, agriculture, and fish classification. While these papers contain detailed descriptions of the methods used, including the types of models, data processing techniques, and evaluation metrics, they do not provide any information about the availability of the code used in the studies. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository for the deep learning pipeline in question.
