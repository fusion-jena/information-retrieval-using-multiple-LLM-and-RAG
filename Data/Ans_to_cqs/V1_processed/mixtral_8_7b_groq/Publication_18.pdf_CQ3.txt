In the context provided, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. This is mentioned in the statement "for step-2, the training dataset contains 700 aerial images, with whales and background, in which each whale is annotated within a bounding box (the total number of bounding boxes is 945)." This suggests that for each image containing a whale, a bounding box is drawn around the whale to identify and distinguish it from the background or other objects in the image. This is a common data annotation technique used in deep learning, particularly for object detection tasks, where the goal is to identify and locate objects within an image.

Other data annotation techniques that are commonly used in deep learning include image-level annotation, where an image is labeled with a single class or category, and pixel-level annotation, also known as semantic segmentation, where each pixel in an image is labeled with a specific class or category. Instance segmentation is a more recent technique that combines object detection and semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object in an image is segmented and labeled with a specific class or category.

In summary, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context provided is bounding box annotation, which is commonly used for object detection tasks. Other data annotation techniques include image-level annotation, pixel-level annotation, and instance segmentation.
