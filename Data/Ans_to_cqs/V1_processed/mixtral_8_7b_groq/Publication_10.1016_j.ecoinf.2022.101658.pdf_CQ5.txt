Based on the provided context, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for this study are not specifically named as standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the datasets used in this study are collected through field measurements at three field sites: Pelican Mountain (PM), Calling Lake (CL), and Conklin (CK).

The manual classification of fuel types used in semantic segmentation training and testing were limited to data collected at PM and CL field sites. The field measurement data and raw photos from the CK field site were used solely for independent validation.

Therefore, the datasets used in this study are custom datasets collected through field measurements, rather than standard datasets commonly used in deep learning research.
