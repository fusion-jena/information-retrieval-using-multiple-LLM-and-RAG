The provided context discusses the dataset, training procedure, and performance of a deep learning model for pollen species identification, but it does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. However, based on common practices in deep learning, we can make an educated guess about the possible regularization techniques employed in this study.

In deep learning, overfitting is a common issue where the model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization techniques are used to mitigate overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function or modifying the network architecture.

One of the most popular regularization techniques is dropout, which randomly sets a fraction of hidden units to zero during training. This prevents co-adaptation of feature detectors and promotes the learning of robust features. Although the context does not explicitly mention dropout, it is a standard method and could have been used in this study.

Another common regularization technique is L2 regularization, which adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the model's weights to the loss function. This encourages smaller weights, reducing the complexity of the model and helping to prevent overfitting. Again, the context does not explicitly mention L2 regularization, but it is a standard method and could have been used in this study.

Data augmentation, which is mentioned in the context, can also be considered a form of regularization. By creating new training samples through transformations like flipping, brightness adjustments, and hue adjustments, the model is exposed to a more diverse set of inputs, which can help improve generalization and reduce overfitting.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that dropout, L2 regularization, or other methods were employed to prevent overfitting. Data augmentation was also used to improve model generalization.
