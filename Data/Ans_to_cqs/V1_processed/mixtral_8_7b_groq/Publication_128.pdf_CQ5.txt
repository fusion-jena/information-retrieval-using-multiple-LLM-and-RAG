Deep learning models in the field of computer vision are often trained and tested on various datasets to evaluate their performance. Some of the commonly used datasets in the deep learning pipeline include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet.

The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is widely used for training various image processing systems, such as recognition of handwritten digits. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of which is a 28x28 grayscale image of a digit between 0 and 9.

The CIFAR dataset, on the other hand, is a collection of natural images that are often used for object recognition tasks. It contains two datasets: CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The CIFAR-100 dataset is similar to CIFAR-10, except it has 100 classes containing 600 images each.

ImageNet is one of the largest and most popular datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It contains over 14 million images, each of which is associated with one of 21,841 categories. ImageNet is used in the annual ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), which is a benchmark in object category recognition.

These datasets are widely used in deep learning models such as AlexNet, ResNet, and MobileNet. For instance, AlexNet was trained on the ImageNet dataset and achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5% and 17.0%, respectively. Similarly, ResNet was also trained on the ImageNet dataset and achieved top-5 error rates of 4.94% and 4.49% on the ILSVRC 2015 and 2016, respectively.

In summary, MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet are some of the commonly used datasets in the deep learning pipeline for training and testing computer vision models. These datasets have been instrumental in the development and evaluation of various deep learning models, including AlexNet, ResNet, and MobileNet.
