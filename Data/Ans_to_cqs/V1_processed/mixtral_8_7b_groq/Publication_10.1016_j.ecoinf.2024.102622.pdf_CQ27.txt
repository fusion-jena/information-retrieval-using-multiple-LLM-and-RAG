Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, we can make some educated guesses based on common practices in the field of machine learning.

First, the model would need to be serialized, which means saving the model architecture and weights to a file so that it can be loaded and used later without having to retrain the model. This is an important step in the model deployment process because it allows for the model to be easily shared and used in different environments.

Next, a platform would need to be selected for deploying the model. This could be a local server, a cloud-based platform, or even an edge device such as a drone or a tractor. The choice of platform would depend on the specific use case and the resources available.

Once the platform is selected, the serialized model would be loaded onto the platform and integrated with any necessary software or hardware. This might involve creating an API for the model, or embedding the model into a larger application.

Finally, the model would need to be tested and validated on the deployment platform to ensure that it is working correctly and producing accurate results.

It's worth noting that the papers provided in the context do not focus on the deployment of the models, but rather on the development and evaluation of the models. Therefore, it's not surprising that there is no information provided about the deployment process.
