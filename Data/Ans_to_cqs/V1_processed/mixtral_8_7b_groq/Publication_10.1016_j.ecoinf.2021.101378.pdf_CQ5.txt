The provided context does not include information about deep learning pipelines or datasets commonly used in deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it focuses on the use of machine learning methods, specifically artificial neural networks, random forest, and maximum entropy modeling, in ecological informatics.

In the context, a dataset was developed for modeling species distribution in ecosystems, including the proportion of land-use types and environmental variables. These environmental variables consist of seven geographical and meteorological factors, and the dataset was extracted from digital maps using a geographic information system (GIS) program. However, this dataset is not a standard deep learning dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

Deep learning pipelines typically use large, annotated datasets for training and testing models. For example, MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits, CIFAR is a dataset of colored images, and ImageNet is a large-scale dataset of images organized according to the WordNet hierarchy. These datasets are widely used in deep learning research and have contributed to the development of various deep learning models and techniques.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot identify any datasets used in deep learning pipelines.
