Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps taken after the model training. However, it does mention some metrics that were calculated during the evaluation of the model's performance.


The context does not provide specific details about the postprocessing steps taken after the model training. However, it does mention that minimum detection confidence scores of 0.7 were used and average precision and recall were calculated as part of the benchmarks for the model's performance. These metrics are commonly used in object detection tasks to evaluate the quality of the model's predictions.

While the context does not mention any postprocessing techniques such as saliency maps or confusion matrices, it is possible that they were used but not included in the provided information. Saliency maps, for example, can be used to visualize the areas of an image that the model is focusing on, which can be helpful in understanding how the model is making its predictions. Confusion matrices, on the other hand, can be used to evaluate the performance of a classification model by comparing the predicted labels to the actual labels.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information about the postprocessing steps taken after the model training, it does mention some metrics that were calculated during the evaluation of the model's performance. It is possible that additional postprocessing techniques were used but not included in the provided information.
