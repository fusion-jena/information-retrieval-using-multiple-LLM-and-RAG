The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data used in this study is likely to be in a tabular format, such as a CSV file, since the results include metrics for various models' performance on different subsets of the data.

The context includes several tables with performance metrics for different models, and these metrics are calculated based on true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. These types of metrics are commonly used in classification tasks, which are often performed on tabular data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a "test set #2 (Irish records only)," which suggests that the data includes geographical or demographic information that was used to create a subset of records from Ireland. This further supports the idea that the data is in a tabular format, as it would be relatively easy to filter a CSV file based on a column for geographical or demographic information.

However, it's important to note that the context does not explicitly state that the data is in a CSV format, and it's possible that the data was originally in a different format that was converted to a tabular format for the purposes of this study.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that the data is likely to be in a tabular format, such as a CSV file.
