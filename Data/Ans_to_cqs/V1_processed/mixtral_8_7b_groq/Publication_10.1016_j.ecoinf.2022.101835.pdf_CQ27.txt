The text provided does not give a detailed description of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the models were optimized using the Optuna library, and their performance was evaluated based on the loss function (mean squared error), mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination (R2).

The optimized models were then used to calculate the first flowering and full blossom dates for each station and year. The root mean square error (RMSE) was calculated to evaluate the overall performance of the models, and the RMSE for each observation site was calculated to evaluate the performance of the models for each site.

Based on the information given, we can infer that the following steps were likely taken to deploy the trained deep learning model:

1. Model optimization: The deep learning model was optimized using the Optuna library, which is a hyperparameter optimization framework. The optimization process involved selecting the structure and hyperparameters of the model, such as the number of decision trees, the depth of trees, the number of intermediate layers, and the number of nodes.
2. Model evaluation: The performance of the optimized models was evaluated based on the loss function, mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination.
3. Model serialization: Once the model was optimized and evaluated, it was likely serialized, which means that it was saved in a file format that can be loaded and used later. Model serialization is an important step in deploying a machine learning model because it allows the model to be used in a production environment.
4. Platform selection: The text does not provide information on the platform used to deploy the model. However, the model could be deployed on a local machine, a cloud platform, or an edge device, depending on the use case.

In summary, based on the information provided, we can infer that the deep learning model was optimized using the Optuna library, evaluated based on various metrics, and likely serialized for deployment. However, the text does not provide information on the platform used for deployment.
