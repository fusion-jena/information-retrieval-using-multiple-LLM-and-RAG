Based on the provided context, there are some postprocessing steps mentioned that are typically involved after the model training process. However, the specific steps of saliency maps and confusion matrix are not explicitly mentioned. Here are the postprocessing steps mentioned in the context:

1. Model prediction beyond the training ranges: The model can predict the presence of the species beyond the training ranges, which can be useful for management planning. This can help in identifying potential suitable habitats for the species outside of the training range.
2. Data limitations: The model indicates potential thresholds on the probability distribution function based on the omission rate of the training presence locations. This can be used as a reference for decision-making authorities to determine suitable/unsuitable locations for the species.
3. Metrics calculation: The model's performance can be evaluated using various metrics such as the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. This metric can be used to compare the model's performance with other models or to evaluate the model's ability to discriminate between suitable and unsuitable habitats.

Therefore, while the specific steps of saliency maps and confusion matrix are not mentioned, the context does provide information on other postprocessing steps such as model prediction beyond the training ranges, data limitations, and metrics calculation.
