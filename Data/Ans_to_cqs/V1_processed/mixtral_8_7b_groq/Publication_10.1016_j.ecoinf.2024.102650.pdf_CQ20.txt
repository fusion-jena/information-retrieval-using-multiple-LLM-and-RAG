Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context focuses on text mining and topic modeling techniques, specifically Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), used for processing and analyzing text data.

Therefore, it is not possible to accurately answer the query without additional information. However, it is common practice to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel computations, which significantly speeds up the training process compared to using a Central Processing Unit (CPU) alone.
