The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is generally recommended to split the dataset into these three subsets to ensure the model's generalizability and performance assessment.

1. Training Set: This is the primary dataset used to train the deep learning model. The model learns patterns and relationships from this data by adjusting its parameters to minimize the loss function.

2. Test Set: The test set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data after training. This set helps assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data. It is crucial to ensure that the test set is independent and not used during the training process.

3. Validation Set: The validation set, also known as the development set, is used during the training process to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Hyperparameters are high-level parameters that are not learned from the data, such as the learning rate, batch size, or the number of layers in a neural network. The validation set is used to estimate the model's performance on unseen data while training, allowing for adjustments to hyperparameters to improve the final model.

In the provided context, the "Microsoft COCO: common objects in context" source describes a dataset with ground-truth annotations, which can be used for splitting data into train, test, and validation sets. The "Deep residual convolutional neural network based on YOLOv5" source uses the COCO dataset for object detection and likely employs these data splitting techniques. However, the specific criteria for splitting the data are not provided in the context.
