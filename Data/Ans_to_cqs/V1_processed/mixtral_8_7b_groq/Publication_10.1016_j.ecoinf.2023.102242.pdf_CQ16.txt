Based on the provided context, there are no specific criteria mentioned regarding when training is complete in the context of remote sensing image classification. However, there are some general concepts in machine learning that can be applied to this problem.

In many machine learning algorithms, training is considered complete when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, even if the training loss continues to decrease. This is because the goal of training is not just to minimize the training loss, but to find a model that generalizes well to new, unseen data. If the validation loss starts to increase, it suggests that the model is starting to overfit to the training data, and further training is unlikely to improve its performance on new data.

In the context of remote sensing image classification, the validation loss could be calculated using a separate validation dataset that is not used in the training process. This dataset should be representative of the overall population of images that the model will be applied to.

The provided context does mention some relevant research related to data processing and classification methods for remote sensing images. For example, Li et al. (2019) discuss the temporal stage and method selection for species classification based on GF-2 remote sensing images. Liu et al. (2012) propose discrepancy measures for selecting the optimal combination of parameter values in object-based image analysis. Ma (2014) focuses on object-based remote sensing image classification of forests based on multi-level segmentation. Mak and Hu (2014) discuss tree species identification and subsequent health determination from mobile lidar data.

While these studies do not directly address the criteria for determining when training is complete, they do highlight the importance of careful data processing and method selection in remote sensing image classification. These factors can have a significant impact on the accuracy and reliability of the classification results.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific criteria for determining when training is complete in remote sensing image classification, the general concept of monitoring the validation loss to detect overfitting can be applied. Careful data processing and method selection are also important factors to consider for accurate and reliable classification results.
