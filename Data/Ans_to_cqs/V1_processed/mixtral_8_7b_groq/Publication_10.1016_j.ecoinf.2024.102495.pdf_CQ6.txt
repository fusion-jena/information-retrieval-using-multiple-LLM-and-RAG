The provided context discusses a study that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning model for a specific task, but it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training the model. However, it is common practice in deep learning to perform certain preprocessing steps on the data, including normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

Normalization is a process that scales numeric data to a specific range, often between 0 and 1. This can help the deep learning model converge during training and can improve the model's performance. In the context of the study, normalization could have been applied to the voice feature extraction results before they were used as input to the deep learning algorithm.

Scaling is similar to normalization, but it involves resizing the features to have the same scale. This can help the model avoid giving too much importance to some features compared to others.

Cleaning refers to the process of removing noise, outliers, or missing values from the data. This step is crucial to ensure that the model learns from high-quality data.

In the study, the authors mention using a CNN deep learning model for voice feature extraction. The preprocessing steps for voice data typically include noise reduction, segmentation, and feature extraction. Noise reduction can be achieved using filters or signal processing techniques. Segmentation involves dividing the continuous signal into smaller frames or segments. Feature extraction is the process of extracting relevant features from the voice signal, such as pitch, intensity, or spectral features.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model, it is common practice to perform normalization, scaling, and cleaning on the data. In the context of voice feature extraction, preprocessing steps include noise reduction, segmentation, and feature extraction.
