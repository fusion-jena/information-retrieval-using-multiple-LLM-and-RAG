The provided context does not directly discuss the data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe a method for extracting variables from footprint images of Amur tigers, which could be considered a form of image annotation.

In the study, the authors extracted various features from the footprint images, including lengths, angles, and areas, which were measured at specific landmark points and their geometric intersections. These landmark points and derived points were then used to create variables that could be used to distinguish between individual tigers.

While this method is not a direct example of data annotation techniques used in deep learning, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, it does demonstrate the importance of accurately annotating data in order to extract meaningful features. In the context of deep learning, accurately annotated data is crucial for training models to correctly identify and categorize objects within images.

To provide a more direct answer to the query, in deep learning, data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image. The box should be tight enough to encompass the object, but not so tight that it cuts off any part of the object.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image to indicate which object it belongs to. This is a more precise form of annotation than bounding box annotation, as it allows for the identification of individual objects within a complex scene.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling pixels in an image according to the category of object they belong to, rather than the specific instance of the object. This is useful for identifying common objects within an image, but may not be as precise as instance segmentation.

These annotation techniques are used to train deep learning models to accurately identify and categorize objects within images, and are an essential part of the deep learning pipeline.
