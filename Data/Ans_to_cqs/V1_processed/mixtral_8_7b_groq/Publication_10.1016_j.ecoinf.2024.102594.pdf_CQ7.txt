In the context provided, the dataset of remote sensing images and semantic labels of land cover classes was split for DeepLabV3+ model training using a specific criterion. Seventy percent of the dataset was used for training, and the remaining was used for validation. This 70-30 split is a common practice in machine learning to ensure that the model is trained on a majority of the data while still having a separate set to test its performance.

Moreover, the training set was enhanced using various data augmentation techniques to increase the sample size and prevent overfitting. These techniques included flipping the images and labels along the X or Y axis, exchanging between multiple image channels while keeping the labels unchanged, randomly rotating the images and labels by 90 degrees, and randomly adding noise to the images while maintaining the labels unchanged.

It is important to note that the criteria for splitting the data and enhancing the training set were not explicitly stated as optimizing these criteria was not the focus of the study. Instead, the study aimed to integrate the classification results predicted by the DeepLabV3+ algorithm and the segmentation results obtained from MRS using Python programming language. The resulting MRS_DeepLabV3+ approach involved counting the number of pixels of each category in the current segmentation object area, selecting the category with the largest area, and assigning the largest category to the current object.

Therefore, while the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training were not the main focus of the study, it was mentioned that 70% of the dataset was used for training and the remaining for validation. Additionally, the training set was enhanced using data augmentation techniques to improve the model's performance.
