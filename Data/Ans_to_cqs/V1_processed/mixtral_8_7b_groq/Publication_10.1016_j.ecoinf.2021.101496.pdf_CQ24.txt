The text provided does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. However, it does mention the use of a artificial neural network (ANN) as one of the methods for modeling SPAD value in a plant study. ANNs, a type of deep learning model, can be affected by randomness due to factors such as the initialization of weights and biases, the order of training examples, and the selection of mini-batches for stochastic gradient descent.

To handle randomness in ANNs, several strategies can be employed:

1. **Fixed seed value**: By setting a fixed seed value, the random number generator used in the model will produce the same sequence of random numbers, ensuring reproducibility of results. This is particularly important for comparing different models or conducting ablation studies.

2. **Data shuffling**: When training an ANN, data can be shuffled to ensure that the model does not learn patterns specific to the order of the training data. This can help improve the model's generalization ability.

3. **Weight and bias initialization**: Initializing weights and biases with small, random values can help break symmetry and ensure that all neurons in the network have a chance to learn. Some popular initialization methods include Xavier initialization and He initialization.

4. **Dropout**: During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0, preventing overfitting and promoting regularization. This introduces randomness into the model, helping it generalize better.

5. **Mini-batch selection**: For stochastic gradient descent, mini-batches of training data are selected randomly. This introduces randomness into the optimization process, helping the model escape local minima and find a better overall solution.

While the text provided does not discuss these strategies explicitly, they are commonly used in the field of deep learning to handle randomness and improve model performance.
