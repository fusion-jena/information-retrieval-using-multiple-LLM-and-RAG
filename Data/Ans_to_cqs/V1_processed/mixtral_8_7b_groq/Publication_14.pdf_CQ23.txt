Based on the provided context, it is mentioned that the deep learning model was fine-tuned for hummingbird detection using a collected dataset. However, there is no explicit mention of measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

However, it is mentioned that the model was trained and tested on video data collected from time-lapse cameras in the Ecuadorian Andes since 2013. This suggests that the data used for training and testing the model may have been collected from different locations and times, which could potentially contribute to the model's generalizability.

Additionally, the model was trained with a batch size of 100 for 20,000 steps, but it is not specified whether cross-validation was used during the training process. Cross-validation is a commonly used technique to assess the performance and generalizability of machine learning models by dividing the dataset into multiple subsets and training and testing the model on each subset.

Furthermore, the context mentions that the model was designed to be conservative with a high threshold for retaining frames, which prioritizes minimizing false negatives at the potential expense of increasing false positives. This could potentially impact the model's generalizability, as a conservative model may be more prone to false positives when applied to new data.

In summary, while the context provides some information about the data used to train and test the deep learning model, it does not explicitly mention any measures taken to ensure the model's generalizability such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
