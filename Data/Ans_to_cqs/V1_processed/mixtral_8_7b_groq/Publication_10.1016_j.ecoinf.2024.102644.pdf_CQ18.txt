Based on the provided context, there is no explicit description of a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it is mentioned that thresholding was necessary for model combination and was based on the fact that the different species models were mutually independent and their probability distributions had very different shapes. This suggests that some level of performance monitoring or evaluation was taking place during the model training process, as they were making decisions about how to combine and threshold the models.

Additionally, it is mentioned that parameter selection methods are often used before ENMs, which implies that some sort of performance evaluation or validation is being done to select the most relevant environmental parameters for the models.

It is also worth noting that the authors mention that the decision thresholds were not biased because the T and P changes, combined with other parameters within complex prediction functions in the MaxEnt models, frequently produced very different cell values across the years. This suggests that they were monitoring the performance of the models in relation to the changes in T and P, and adjusting the thresholds accordingly.

In summary, while the context does not provide a detailed description of a strategy for monitoring model performance during training, it does suggest that some level of performance evaluation and validation was taking place through the thresholding and parameter selection methods used.
