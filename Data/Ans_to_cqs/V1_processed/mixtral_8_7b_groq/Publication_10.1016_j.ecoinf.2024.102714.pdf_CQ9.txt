Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the description of a study that involves the use of different datasets and methods to classify and map habitats. However, it does not mention where the data or code used in the study can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query. If the data repository is available on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, it would be helpful if the text included a reference to it.
