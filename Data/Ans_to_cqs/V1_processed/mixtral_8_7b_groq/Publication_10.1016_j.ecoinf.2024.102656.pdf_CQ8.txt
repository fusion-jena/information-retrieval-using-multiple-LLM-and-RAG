Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context includes several research papers and a conference paper, but none of them mention or provide a link to the code repository on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

The study by Mohammadi et al. (2024) discusses a comprehensive and innovative methodology that combines ensemble habitat suitability modeling, cumulative resistant kernel, and factorial least-cost path techniques for predicting potential habitats and habitat connectivity for ungulates. However, the paper does not provide information about the code repository.

The paper by Niyogi et al. (2021) discusses habitat connectivity for the conservation of small ungulates in a human-dominated landscape, but it does not mention the code repository used in their study. Similarly, the paper by Ofstad et al. (2016) discusses home ranges, habitat, and body mass in ungulates, but it does not provide information about the code repository.

The paper by Pascual-Rico et al. (2009) discusses the use of empirically derived source-destination models to map regional conservation corridors, but it does not mention the code repository used in their study.

The papers by Elith et al. (2006), Dujon and Schofield (2019), Eskildsen et al. (2013), and Feizabadi et al. (2023) also do not provide any information about the code repository used in their studies.

Therefore, I am unable to provide the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study.
