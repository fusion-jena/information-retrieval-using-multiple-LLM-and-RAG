The provided context does not give specific information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions some related resources that might be helpful.

Firstly, the PyTorch-BigGraph system is a large-scale graph embedding system developed by Lerer et al. (2019). This system can handle large graph datasets and might be used as a part of a deep learning pipeline. The paper provides a link to the code repository, but there is no information about data storage.

Secondly, the scikit-learn library is a machine learning library for Python, which includes various algorithms and tools for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation (Blondel et al., 2011b). This library might be used in a deep learning pipeline for data processing and analysis. However, it does not provide a data repository but focuses on the implementation of machine learning algorithms.

Thirdly, the paper by Xue et al. (2017a) discusses deep matrix factorization methods for recovering corrupted data in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). This method can be used for pre-processing and data assurance in WSNs, which might be a part of a deep learning pipeline. However, the paper does not provide any information about data repositories.

Finally, the paper by Lim et al. (2020) analyzes global PM2.5 concentrations and their drivers in recent decades. Although this paper is not directly related to deep learning, it provides a dataset of PM2.5 concentrations, which might be used for developing and testing deep learning models for air quality prediction. The dataset is available in the supplementary materials of the paper.

In summary, the provided context does not give specific information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, some related resources, such as PyTorch-BigGraph, scikit-learn, and the PM2.5 concentration dataset, might be helpful for developing and testing deep learning models.
