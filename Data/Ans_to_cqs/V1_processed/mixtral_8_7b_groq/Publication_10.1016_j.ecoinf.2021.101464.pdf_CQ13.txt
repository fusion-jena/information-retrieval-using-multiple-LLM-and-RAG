I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. The models mentioned in the context are a multiple linear regression model and a random forest model. Hyperparameters are specific to machine learning algorithms, and the learning rate and optimizer are hyperparameters used in certain deep learning algorithms.

For the random forest model, the context mentions that it was implemented using R statistical software, but it does not provide information about specific hyperparameters used in the model. Common hyperparameters for random forest models include the number of trees, the number of variables considered for splitting at each leaf node, and the maximum depth of the trees.

In summary, based on the given context, I cannot provide information on the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model because no deep learning model was mentioned.
