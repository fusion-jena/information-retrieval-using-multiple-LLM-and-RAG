Based on the provided context, the following measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model:

First, the model was trained using a large dataset obtained over 100 epochs, which helped the model to learn a wide range of patterns and relationships in the data. The use of both test and validation data in Figure 9 shows that the model was able to learn from the training data without overfitting, indicating that the model can generalize well to new data.

Second, the model employed dropout layers, which helped with model regularization and improved generalization. Dropout layers randomly drop out a fraction of the input units during training, which helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Third, the model was configured with a filter size of 2 and a dropout value of 50% in the first three layers. This configuration helped to reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Fourth, the model was evaluated using performance metrics such as Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, and Accuracy. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance and help ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data.

Finally, the model was trained using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with Backpropagation as the learning algorithm and Adam as the optimizer. These techniques are widely used in deep learning and have been shown to improve the generalizability of models.

Overall, the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model include using a large dataset, employing dropout layers, configuring the model with appropriate hyperparameters, evaluating the model using performance metrics, and using well-established deep learning techniques.
