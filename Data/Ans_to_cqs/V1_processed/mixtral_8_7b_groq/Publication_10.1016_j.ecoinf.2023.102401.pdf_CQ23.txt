Based on the provided context, the generalizability of the deep learning model, referred to as YWnet, was addressed by conducting experiments on the URPC datasets, which consist of 1201 images distributed across four object categories. The experimental data was divided into training and test sets, adhering to an 8:2 ratio. Specifically, the training process utilized a dataset comprising 956 images, while a separate test set of 244 images was used to evaluate the model's ability to generalize.

Furthermore, the generalization capabilities of YWnet were assessed on five additional datasets, namely Aquarium, Trash-ICRA19, VisDrone, NWPU VHR-10, and HRSID. These datasets encompass various categories, including marine animals, waste, and high-resolution satellite imagery. The utilization of these diverse datasets contributed to enhancing the model's generalizability by exposing it to a wide range of data distributions and object categories.

Moreover, data augmentation techniques were applied during the training of YWnet. These techniques, as outlined in Table 2, introduced diversity into the training dataset, enabling the model to learn robust features and improve its performance in real-world scenarios. The specified ranges and probabilities for each augmentation technique contributed to the comprehensive processing of input features, allowing the model to capture both high-level semantic information and preserve relevant details during the feature extraction process.

In summary, the generalizability of the YWnet model was addressed through the division of experimental data into training and test sets, the evaluation of the model on multiple diverse datasets, and the application of data augmentation techniques during the training process.
