The purpose of the deep learning models in the provided context is object detection. These models are designed to detect and count specific objects, such as seals, seabirds, and penguins, in remote sensing data or aerial imagery.

In the study by Stammerjohn and Barrington (2020), the authors used a crowd-sourced approach to train a deep learning model for habitat affinity analysis of the Weddell seal in Antarctica. Although the specific deep learning model is not mentioned, it can be inferred that the model was designed for object detection or classification, as the goal was to identify and analyze the seals' habitats.

Le et al. (2022) developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for the automated survey of seabird colonies. CNNs are commonly used for object detection tasks, and the authors specifically mention that their model can detect and count individual seabirds in aerial images.

Liu et al. (2020) aimed to develop efficient machine learning methods for penguin counting. While the specific deep learning model is not mentioned, the purpose of the model is clearly object detection, as the goal is to accurately detect and count penguins in aerial images.

Witharana and Lynch (2016) used an object-based image analysis approach for detecting penguin guano in very high spatial resolution satellite images. The purpose of their deep learning model is object detection, as they aim to identify and analyze penguin guano patches.

Wood et al. (2021) assessed the accuracy and precision of citizen scientist animal counts from drone imagery. While the specific deep learning model is not mentioned, the purpose of the model is object detection, as the goal is to detect and count animals in the drone images.

Peng et al. (2020) used a modified faster R-CNN for kiang detection in Tibetan plateau UAS imagery. Faster R-CNN is a popular deep learning model for object detection, and the authors specifically mention that their model can detect and count kiangs in the aerial images.

In summary, the purpose of the deep learning models in the provided context is object detection, specifically for detecting and counting various animals, such as seals, seabirds, and penguins, in remote sensing data or aerial imagery.
