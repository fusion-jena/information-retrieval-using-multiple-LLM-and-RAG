Based on the provided context, the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for this particular study on caesium-137 concentrations in rivers are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the data is collected using sensors or monitoring stations located downstream of nuclear industries on the Rhône and Loire Rivers.

The context states that "Three monitoring stations were studied, one on the Rhône River and two on the Loire River, all of them downstream nuclear industries." This suggests that the data is collected through these monitoring stations, which are likely equipped with sensors to measure the caesium-137 concentrations in rivers.

Furthermore, the study uses this collected data to train a deep learning model, specifically an encoder-decoder neural network called "Hierarchical Attention-Based Recurrent Highway Networks" (HRHN), to reconstruct caesium-137 chronics particulate concentration in rivers.

Therefore, while the specific methods for data collection are not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the data is collected using sensors or monitoring stations located downstream of nuclear industries.
