The text provided does not give a detailed description of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does mention some steps that were taken in the process of data preparation and sampling which can indirectly contribute to the model's generalizability.

 The text does not explicitly mention the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting for ensuring the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does discuss the use of various spectral and water indices, soil indices, and vegetation indices, which were calculated for each collection. This suggests that a diverse set of features was extracted from the dataset, which could potentially improve the model's performance.

The text also describes the sampling strategy used for defining the training and testing samples. A combination of the previous scientific foundation and the current capabilities of Google Earth Engine (GEE) was explored. Instead of strictly distributing a fixed number of training areas among the thematic classes, pure training areas were included. These well-identified areas should contain at least 50 pixels in total and prominently represent the class of interest. This distribution was carried out through simplified random sampling, allowing for the effective capture of variability within each class and improvement of the model's performance.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, it does discuss the inclusion of various spectral and water indices, soil indices, and vegetation indices, as well as a detailed sampling strategy. These steps can indirectly contribute to the generalizability of the deep learning model.
