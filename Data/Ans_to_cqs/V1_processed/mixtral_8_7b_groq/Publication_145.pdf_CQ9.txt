The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the use of a deep learning algorithm called U-net and very high-resolution multispectral images from GeoEye satellite to identify and map canopy palms over 3000 km2 of Amazonian forest. The study's findings, such as the overall accuracy of the map, the F1-score, and the relation of canopy palm trees to human disturbance and edaphic conditions, are discussed in detail. However, there is no mention of the data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
