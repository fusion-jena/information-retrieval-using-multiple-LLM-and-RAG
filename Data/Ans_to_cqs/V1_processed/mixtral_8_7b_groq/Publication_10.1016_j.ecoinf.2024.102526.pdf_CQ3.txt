In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in the field of computer vision and image analysis, I can provide a general answer.

In a deep learning pipeline for image analysis, data annotation techniques are crucial for training models to accurately recognize and understand various elements within images. Some commonly used data annotation techniques include:

1. **Bounding Box Annotation**: This technique involves drawing a box around an object of interest in an image. It helps the model to locate and identify the object within the image. Bounding box annotation is often used for object detection tasks.

2. **Semantic Segmentation**: This is a pixel-wise classification approach where each pixel in an image is assigned a class label. It helps the model to understand the spatial distribution of different objects or regions within an image. Semantic segmentation is useful for tasks like scene understanding and image segmentation.

3. **Instance Segmentation**: This is an extension of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is separately segmented and labeled. It allows the model to differentiate between individual objects of the same class. Instance segmentation is beneficial for tasks like counting objects or tracking individual objects in a video.

4. **Keypoint Annotation**: In this technique, specific points or landmarks on an object are annotated. It is often used for tasks like human pose estimation or facial landmark detection.

5. **Classification Annotation**: This involves labeling an image with a specific class. It is used for tasks like image classification or object recognition.

6. **Linking Annotation**: This technique involves creating links between annotated elements in an image. It is useful for tasks like object relationship understanding or scene graph generation.

The specific annotation technique used depends on the task at hand and the desired output of the model. The provided context includes terms like "image-annotation-QAQC" and "image curation protocol", which suggest that some form of data annotation and quality control is being performed. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer related to the provided context.
