Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications of efforts to ensure the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

Firstly, the researchers conducted preliminary experiments to minimize the input length, and thus minimize network parameters. This was done to prevent the model from becoming too complex and overfitting to the training data. 

Secondly, the researchers used a technique called transfer learning, where they used a pre-trained ResNet50 model. This model was pre-trained on ImageNet, a large-scale image recognition dataset. By using a pre-trained model, the researchers were able to leverage the knowledge that the model had gained from the ImageNet dataset, which helped to improve the performance of the model on their own dataset.

Thirdly, the researchers used a technique called feature extraction, where they froze the feature extracted from the pre-trained model. This meant that the weights of the pre-trained model were kept constant during the training process, which helped to prevent overfitting.

Lastly, the researchers reported the average F1 score across 13 unique executions. This suggests that they may have used some form of cross-validation, where they divided their dataset into multiple subsets and trained the model on each subset. This would help to ensure that the model's performance was not dependent on a particular subset of the data, and thus improve its generalizability.

In conclusion, while the text does not explicitly mention measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, there are indications that the researchers took steps to prevent overfitting and improve the performance of their model. These steps include minimizing the input length, using transfer learning and feature extraction, and reporting the average F1 score across multiple executions.
