The provided context does not include information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. The text mainly discusses the use of ecoacoustic indices (EAI) and methods to mitigate device biases in site comparisons.

However, it is mentioned that the goal is to extend the applicability of EAIs to fields like machine learning and deep learning, which require consistent feature spaces across studies. This implies that the deep learning model's performance would need to be evaluated using relevant metrics. Common evaluation metrics for deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).
