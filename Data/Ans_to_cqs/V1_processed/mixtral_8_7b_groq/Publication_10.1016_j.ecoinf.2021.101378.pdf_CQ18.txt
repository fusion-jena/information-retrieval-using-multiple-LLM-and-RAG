The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that machine learning methods such as artificial neural networks, random forest, and maximum entropy modeling (Maxent) are used to predict the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease based on environmental factors.

In general, monitoring the model performance during training involves using techniques such as cross-validation, where the data is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set. This helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and is able to generalize to new data.

In the context of predicting the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease, it is mentioned that random forest and Maxent models are used. Random forest models are an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. Maxent models are a machine learning method that estimates the maximum entropy distribution of a target variable based on a set of environmental factors.

The context also mentions that the model performance is evaluated using metrics such as the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The AUC measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative cases, with a value of 1 indicating perfect discrimination and a value of 0.5 indicating no discrimination.

Overall, while the specific strategy for monitoring the model performance during training is not mentioned, it is likely that techniques such as cross-validation and evaluation metrics such as the AUC are used to ensure that the model is able to accurately predict the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease based on environmental factors.
