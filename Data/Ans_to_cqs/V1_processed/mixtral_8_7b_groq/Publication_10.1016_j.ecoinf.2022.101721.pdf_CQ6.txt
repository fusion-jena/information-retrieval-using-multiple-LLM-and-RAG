Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved, including normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

Normalization is the process of rescaling numerical data to a range of values that is suitable for the learning algorithm. This is often necessary because many machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models, are sensitive to the scale of the input features. Normalization can be achieved through various methods, such as min-max scaling, z-score normalization, or decimal scaling. For instance, min-max scaling rescales the data to a range of [0, 1] or [-1, 1], while z-score normalization rescales the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

Scaling is another preprocessing step that is similar to normalization, but it involves rescaling the data to a specific range of values, typically [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. Scaling is often used when the data has a natural scale that is appropriate for the learning algorithm. For example, if the data represents the amplitude of a sound wave, scaling it to a range of [0, 1] would preserve the relative differences between the amplitudes.

Cleaning is the process of removing or correcting errors, inconsistencies, or missing values in the data. This is an important step because errors or missing values can significantly affect the performance of the learning algorithm. Cleaning can be achieved through various methods, such as imputation, outlier detection, or data transformation. For instance, imputation involves replacing missing values with estimated values based on the other data points. Outlier detection involves identifying and removing data points that are significantly different from the other data points. Data transformation involves transforming the data into a different format that is more suitable for the learning algorithm.

In the context of bat call classification, preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are essential for improving the accuracy of the deep learning model. For example, the paper by Paumen et al. (2021) used a convolutional neural network to classify bat calls based on their spectrograms. Before training the model, the authors normalized the spectrograms by dividing each frequency bin by the maximum amplitude across all bins. This normalization step ensured that the model was not biased towards any particular frequency range.

Moreover, the paper by Russo and Jones (2002) used R-code to classify bat calls based on their frequency spectra. The authors scaled the frequency spectra to a range of [0, 1] and cleaned the data by removing missing values and outliers. They also transformed the data by applying a Fourier transform to convert the time-domain signals into the frequency domain.

In summary, normalization, scaling, and cleaning are important preprocessing steps that are typically involved before training a deep learning model. These steps ensure that the data is suitable for the learning algorithm and improve the accuracy of the model. In the context of bat call classification, these steps are essential for handling the variability in the acoustic features of bat calls.
