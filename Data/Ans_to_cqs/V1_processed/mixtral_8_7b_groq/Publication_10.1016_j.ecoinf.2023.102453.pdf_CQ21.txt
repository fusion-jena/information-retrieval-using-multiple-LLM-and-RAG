After the model training process, there are several postprocessing steps that can be involved. However, the context provided does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps beyond model validation and testing. It does mention the use of different metrics for performance measurement, but it does not specify what those metrics are.

That being said, there are some common postprocessing steps that are often used in machine learning models, including saliency maps, metrics calculation, and confusion matrix.

Saliency maps are a way to visualize the parts of an input image that are most important for the model's prediction. This can be useful for understanding how the model is making its decisions and for identifying any potential biases or weaknesses in the model.

Metrics calculation involves evaluating the performance of the model using various quantitative measures. These can include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and many others. These metrics can help to provide a more objective assessment of the model's performance and can be useful for comparing different models or for identifying areas for improvement.

A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by comparing the predicted labels to the actual labels. It can provide insights into the types of errors that the model is making and can help to identify areas for improvement.

In the context of the study described, it appears that the primary postprocessing step is the calculation of metrics to evaluate the performance of the model. The study mentions that the performance of the model is measured using different metrics, but it does not specify what those metrics are. It also mentions that the model is tested and validated to confirm that it has achieved the desired performance.

Overall, while the context provided does not explicitly mention any specific postprocessing steps beyond model validation and testing, there are several common postprocessing steps that are often used in machine learning models, including saliency maps, metrics calculation, and confusion matrix.
