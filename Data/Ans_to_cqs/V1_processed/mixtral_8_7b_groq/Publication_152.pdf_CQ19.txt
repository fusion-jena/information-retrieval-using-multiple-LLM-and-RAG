The specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models in the provided context are not mentioned. However, we can make some educated guesses based on the common frameworks used in the research community.

In the first reference, "Learning image features with fewer labels using a semi-supervised deep convolutional network" by Ti et al., the authors do not explicitly mention the deep learning framework they used. However, they do mention using the Caffe deep learning framework in a previous study (Ti et al., 2018), so it is possible they used Caffe for this study as well.

In the second reference, "The Euclidean distance transform in arbitrary dimensions" by Ragnemalm, the paper is focused on a mathematical concept rather than a deep learning model, so no framework is mentioned.

In the main text, the authors use the U-Net architecture for identifying a specific invasive vegetation species. The U-Net architecture was first introduced in a paper by Ronneberger et al. (2015), who implemented their architecture using the Theano deep learning framework. However, since then, U-Net has been implemented in many other deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

The authors also mention using a pre-trained SE-ResNet-50 model to improve results. SE-ResNet-50 is a variant of the ResNet-50 architecture, which was originally implemented in the Caffe framework. However, it has since been implemented in many other frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Therefore, while the specific deep learning frameworks used are not mentioned in the provided context, it is likely that the authors used popular frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or a previous version of Caffe.
