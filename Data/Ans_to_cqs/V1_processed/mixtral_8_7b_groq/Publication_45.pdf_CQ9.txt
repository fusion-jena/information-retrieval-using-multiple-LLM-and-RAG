The data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study on predicting ecological patterns is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is stated that the complete data set used in the study by Seidl et al. (2015) is available online. Additionally, Seidl et al. (2016) provide more information on the dataset and statistical analyses of the data. It is possible that the data is available in one of the repositories you mentioned, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, but there is no direct reference to it. I would recommend checking the papers' references or contacting the authors for more information on the data repository.
