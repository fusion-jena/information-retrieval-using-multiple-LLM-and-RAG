Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam used in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying animal sounds in soundscape recordings, and describes the data preprocessing and model architecture in detail. However, it does not specify the optimization techniques employed during the training of the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
