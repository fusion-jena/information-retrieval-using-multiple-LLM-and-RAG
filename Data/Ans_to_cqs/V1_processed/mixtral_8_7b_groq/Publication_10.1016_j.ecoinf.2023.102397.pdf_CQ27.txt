Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, we can infer some parts of the process from the context.

First, Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020) analyzed the effect of sample size on deep neural networks and concluded that increasing the number of hidden layers, which can be interpreted as adding more training recordings, could largely improve the performance of the model. This implies that the deep learning model was trained using a certain number of recordings and hidden layers.

Next, the study mentions that the same results would be expected for all the software programs if they worked to perfection, implying that the trained deep learning model was tested against other software programs for comparison.

Additionally, the study measured the time each software spent on analyzing the entire target dataset, which included 32,640 recordings. This suggests that the deep learning model was applied to the entire target dataset for evaluation.

However, the context does not provide information on how the trained deep learning model was deployed, such as whether it was serialized to a file or deployed to a specific platform. Therefore, we cannot provide a complete answer to the query based on the given context.
