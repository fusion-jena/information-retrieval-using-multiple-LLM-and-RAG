Based on the provided context, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are related to remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS). More specifically, the data formats include Digital Surface Models (DSM), Digital Terrain Models (DTM), and Digital Orthophoto Maps (DOM).

In the study "Assessment of deep learning based classification of LiDAR and UAV point clouds for DTM creation and flood risk mapping. Geosciences 9, 323," the authors used LiDAR and UAV point clouds for DTM creation and flood risk mapping. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances. UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) point clouds are obtained through photogrammetry, which is the science of making measurements from photographs. DSM, DTM, and DOM are raster datasets that store elevation data, where DSM represents the earth's surface including buildings and vegetation, DTM represents the bare ground, and DOM is an orthorectified image where each pixel contains elevation information.

In the study "Modeling the topography of shallow braided rivers using structure-from-motion photogrammetry. Geomorphology 213, 166â€“182," the authors used images obtained from UAV photogrammetry to model the topography of shallow braided rivers. They processed the images using the Pix4Dmapper software to produce high-resolution DSM and DOM datasets.

In the study "Individual tree segmentation and tree species classification in subtropical broadleaf forests using UAV-based LiDAR, hyperspectral, and ultrahigh-resolution RGB data. Remote Sens. Environ. 280, 113143," the authors used UAV-based LiDAR, hyperspectral, and ultrahigh-resolution RGB data for individual tree segmentation and tree species classification. LiDAR data provides 3D information about the forest, while hyperspectral data provides information about the reflectance of light in different wavelengths, and RGB data provides information about the red, green, and blue components of light.

Therefore, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline include DSM, DTM, DOM, LiDAR, hyperspectral, and RGB data. These data formats are used for various applications in remote sensing and GIS, such as DTM creation, flood risk mapping, topography modeling, and tree segmentation and classification.
