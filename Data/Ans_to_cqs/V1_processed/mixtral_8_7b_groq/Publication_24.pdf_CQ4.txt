The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by creating modified versions of the original data, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling images in computer vision tasks. In the context of ecoacoustic assessment using deep learning, data augmentation might involve creating modified versions of audio recordings.

However, the text does mention that the authors used different normalization strategies on the input data. Specifically, they applied "normalisation strategies" to a 32 × 21 × 4 tensor, which was the input to the neural network. Normalization is a type of data preprocessing that can help improve the performance of deep learning models by transforming the input data to have zero mean and unit variance.

The authors used Python, Theano, Lasagne, and librosa to implement their deep learning pipeline. While these tools support various data augmentation techniques, the text does not provide enough information to determine whether any such techniques were used in this particular study. Therefore, we cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the given context.
