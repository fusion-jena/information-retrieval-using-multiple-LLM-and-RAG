Based on the provided context, there is no information about deploying a trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the use of species distribution models (SDMs) in marine environments, specifically for seahorses, and the application of these models in conservation biology and wildlife management.

The SDMs mentioned in the context are likely statistical or machine learning models that predict the presence or absence of a species based on environmental variables. The 'biomod2' package in R is an example of a tool used for species distribution modeling within an ensemble forecasting framework. However, the context does not provide information on the deployment of deep learning models.

Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs), require specific processes for deployment, such as model serialization, platform selection, and integration with existing systems. Model serialization involves saving the trained model in a format that can be loaded and used for predictions. Platform selection involves choosing the hardware and software environment where the model will be deployed, such as a local machine, cloud-based server, or edge device. Integration with existing systems may involve creating APIs or other interfaces that allow the model to receive input data and return predictions.

Therefore, while the provided context provides valuable information on the use of SDMs in marine conservation, it does not answer the query regarding the deployment of deep learning models.
