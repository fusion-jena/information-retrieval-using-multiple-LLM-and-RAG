Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of image annotation was used to train the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for image classification.

In the context, it is mentioned that the CNN model was trained with a source dataset to predict images from a different target dataset. This suggests that the images in the source dataset were annotated with class labels (family labels) to enable the model to learn the features of each class.

Furthermore, the study employed domain adversarial training of neural networks (DANN) to improve the prediction performance of models trained by non-standardized, low-quality images. DANN incorporates a certain portion of the unknown target dataset in the model and jointly predicts the class of the source images and the dataset (domain) of all input images. This implies that the target dataset was also annotated, at least with dataset labels, to enable the DANN model to differentiate between the source and target datasets.

However, the context does not provide information on whether more sophisticated annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation were used. These techniques can provide more precise annotations and enable the model to learn more detailed features of the objects in the images.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that the images were annotated with class labels, and possibly with more precise annotations using techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
