The provided context does not give a direct link to the data repository of a specific deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) as a prominent repository of big biodiversity data that is often used in ecological and ecosystem models. The GBIF repository is a taxonomic and observation data provider involved in several data FAIRness initiatives, offering an R package for automated retrieval of occurrence records containing taxonomic, coordinate, sighting authorship, and primary source information.

To access data from GBIF, you can visit their website at <https://www.gbif.org/>. From there, you can search for species of interest and download the available data. If you are looking for a deep learning pipeline's data specifically, you might need to look at the documentation or resources associated with the project, as they should provide details on where their data is sourced and how to access it.
