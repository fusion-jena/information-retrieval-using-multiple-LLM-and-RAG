Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context includes details about various studies related to the application of deep learning in the field of ecology and entomology, such as the use of two-stage convolutional neural networks for identifying tiny herbivorous beetles and the development of a hierarchical classification system for arthropod species.

The studies cited in the context include "EfficientNet: rethinking model scaling for convolutional neural networks" by Tan and Le (2019), "Hierarchical classification of very small objects: application to the detection of arthropod species" by Tresson et al. (2021), "CORIGAN: assessing multiple species and interactions within images" by Tresson et al. (2019), "Automated taxonomic identification of insects with expert-level accuracy using effective feature transfer from convolutional networks" by Valan et al. (2019), and "Using a two-stage convolutional neural network to rapidly identify tiny herbivorous beetles in the field" by Van Etten (2018).

While these studies provide valuable insights into the application of deep learning in ecology and entomology, there is no mention of a code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the studies. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
