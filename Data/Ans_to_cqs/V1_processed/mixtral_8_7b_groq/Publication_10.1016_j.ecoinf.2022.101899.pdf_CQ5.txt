Based on the provided context, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for wildfire event prediction and forest vulnerability analysis are not explicitly named as standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, the context does mention that 97 images were extracted from April 2013 to July 2021 using the Code Editor tool. These images were analyzed to extract Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from 9841 areas in the forest.

The dataset created from this analysis includes the mean NDVI score, month date stamp of the time each image was taken, and forest vulnerability as the percentage of vegetation with low NDVI scores. Some images had to be excluded due to inappropriate NDVI estimates, lack of such estimates, and cloud coverage. Additionally, data was extracted during the main wildfire events that spread through the selected forest from September 2019 to January 2020.

Therefore, the dataset used in this study consists of the extracted NDVI data and wildfire event data from the selected forest areas, along with environmental expert knowledge and reports from the Bureau of Meteorology, Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements, and Tasmanian Fire Service.
