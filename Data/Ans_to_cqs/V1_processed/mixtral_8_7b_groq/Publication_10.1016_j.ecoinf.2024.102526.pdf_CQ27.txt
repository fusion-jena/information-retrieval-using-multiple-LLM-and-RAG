Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, we can infer some steps that might have been taken based on the mentioned documents and the general process of deploying deep learning models.

First, the researchers would have trained a deep learning model for image analysis, likely using satellite and aerial images, as mentioned in the context. The training process would have involved selecting a suitable model architecture, preprocessing the images, training the model, and evaluating its performance using metrics like accuracy or F1 score.

Once the model was trained and evaluated, the researchers might have serialized the model, which means saving the model's architecture, weights, and other relevant information in a file. Model serialization is a common practice in deep learning, as it allows researchers to share the model with others or deploy it on different platforms.

Regarding platform selection, the context does not provide specific details about the deployment platform. However, the document "Camera orientation to subject in satellite and aerial images with deep learning" suggests that the model was used for image analysis, so the platform could be a server or a cloud-based infrastructure capable of processing large image datasets.

Additionally, the context includes information about image capture, such as image-acquisition-settings, image-pixel-per-millimeter, image-area-square-meter, and image-curation-protocol. These details suggest that the researchers followed a systematic approach for image capture and data curation, which would be essential for deploying a deep learning model in a production environment.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, we can infer that the researchers might have serialized the model and deployed it on a server or cloud-based infrastructure for image analysis. The researchers also likely followed a systematic approach for image capture and data curation, which would be crucial for deploying the model in a production environment.
