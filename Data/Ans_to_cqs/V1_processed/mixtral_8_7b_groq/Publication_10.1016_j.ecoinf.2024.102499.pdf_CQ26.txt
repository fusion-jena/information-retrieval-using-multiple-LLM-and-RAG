Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, the authors of the study mentioned that they used a deep learning model called U-net to discriminate sharks at an individual level on images, achieving an accuracy of 81%. The model was trained and tested on image datasets, but there is no information about whether data bias techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection were used during the preprocessing phase.

On the other hand, the authors mentioned that they used the NASnet architecture with a Faster-rcnn backbone implemented in Tensorflow2 to train their deep learning models. They used a GPU-cluster equipped with 4 RTX8000 to train the models for 96 hours per model. The authors also computed the recall, precision, and F-measure for each model to evaluate their performance. However, they did not mention any data bias techniques used during the preprocessing phase.

In summary, while the authors of the study used deep learning models to discriminate sharks at an individual level on images, there is no explicit information in the provided context about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
