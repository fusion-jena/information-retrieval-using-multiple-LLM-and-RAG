The provided context discusses a study that uses data from a 2017 survey related to continuous cover forestry and ecological informatics. The study mentions the use of relascope sampling, nested sample plot methods, and plus-sampling or in-situ determination of diversity indices. However, the context does not directly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets.

Deep learning pipelines typically involve several stages, starting with data collection, followed by data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation. The data collection method depends on the specific problem and the available data sources.

In the context of the study, the data collection method appears to be a survey, as it mentions the use of a 2017 survey. Surveys are a common method for collecting data in many fields, including ecology, social sciences, and engineering. Surveys can be conducted through various means, such as online questionnaires, face-to-face interviews, or telephone interviews.

In addition to surveys, sensors and public datasets are also common sources of data for deep learning pipelines. Sensors can provide real-time data on various phenomena, such as temperature, humidity, and motion. Public datasets are often available in various domains, such as healthcare, finance, and transportation, and can be a valuable resource for training deep learning models.

Therefore, based on the provided context and general knowledge of deep learning pipelines, we can infer that surveys, sensors, and public datasets are potential methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, the specific method used depends on the problem at hand and the available data sources.
