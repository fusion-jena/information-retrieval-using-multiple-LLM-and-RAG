The provided context does not include information about a specific deep learning pipeline or its data repository. However, it does mention several data repositories and resources that could be used for sharing a deep learning pipeline related to land use and land cover classification.

One such repository is the Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB), which hosts the Santa Barbara County coast (2020) dataset. This dataset includes high-resolution hyperspectral remote sensing data that could be used for training a deep learning model for land use and land cover classification.

Another repository mentioned in the context is Zenodo, which is a research data repository that allows researchers to deposit and share datasets, software, and other research outputs. The Scikit-image and Scikit-learn packages, which are mentioned in the context, have code repositories on GitHub and data repositories on Zenodo.

Figshare and Dryad are also research data repositories that could be used for sharing a deep learning pipeline related to land use and land cover classification. GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) is a data repository that focuses on biodiversity data, so it may not be the best fit for a deep learning pipeline related to land use and land cover classification.

In addition to the data repositories mentioned above, the context also includes references to several papers that use machine learning and remote sensing data for land use and land cover classification. These papers may include information about the data and code repositories used in their research.

Overall, while the provided context does not include specific information about the data repository of a deep learning pipeline for land use and land cover classification, it does provide several options for sharing and accessing research data and code.
