Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the studies. The context focuses on the attribution of climate and human activities to vegetation change in China, specifically in the Loess Plateau, using machine learning techniques. However, it does not provide information about the code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
