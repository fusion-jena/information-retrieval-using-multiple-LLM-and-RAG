The provided context discusses the use of deep learning for herbarium sheet image analysis, specifically for semantic segmentation tasks. However, it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, data annotation techniques for deep learning can include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and others.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image. This technique is commonly used for object detection tasks, where the goal is to locate and identify objects within an image.

Instance segmentation, on the other hand, involves not only identifying the objects within an image but also segmenting each instance of the object from the background and from other instances. This technique is useful for tasks where the exact shape and location of each object instance are important, such as in autonomous driving or medical image analysis.

Semantic segmentation, which is the focus of the provided context, involves labeling each pixel in an image with the class of the object it belongs to. This technique is useful for tasks where the goal is to understand the composition and structure of an image, such as in scene understanding or image classification.

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data annotation technique used in this particular deep learning pipeline is semantic segmentation. The high-resolution herbarium sheet images were resized and augmented before being used to train a DeepLabv3+ model for semantic segmentation. The model was fine-tuned on a dataset with binary class annotations (leaf or background).

However, the context does not provide information on how the annotations were created or whether other annotation techniques were used in addition to semantic segmentation. Therefore, a definitive answer to the query cannot be provided based solely on the given context.
