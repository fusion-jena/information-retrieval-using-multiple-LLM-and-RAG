The context provided discusses two types of neural network models, deep neural networks (DNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, but it does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the models. However, it does provide some insight into the possible hyperparameters that could be used.

In the context of the DNN model used for land cover/land use (LCLU) classification, the authors performed a comparative analysis of hyperparameters optimization approaches (Azedou et al., 2023). This suggests that the DNN model has various hyperparameters that can be optimized for better performance. Common hyperparameters for DNNs include learning rate, number of layers, number of neurons, activation function, batch size, and optimizer.

In the case of the LSTM model, the context discusses its use for processing sequential data and its ability to capture long-term dependencies in data (Bonato et al., 2023). LSTM models have additional hyperparameters compared to DNNs, such as the number of memory cells, forget gate bias, input gate bias, and output gate bias.

Therefore, while the exact hyperparameters used in the models are not specified in the provided context, it can be inferred that the DNN model has hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of layers, number of neurons, activation function, batch size, and optimizer, and the LSTM model has additional hyperparameters such as the number of memory cells, forget gate bias, input gate bias, and output gate bias.

Another study compares the performance of RF models and Lasso models in forecasting ENSO, but it does not mention any hyperparameters used in the models (RF models are based on tree structure and Lasso is a linear model) (Barrios-Perez et al., 2021).
