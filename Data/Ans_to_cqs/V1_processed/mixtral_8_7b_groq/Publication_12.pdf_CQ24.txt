The text provided does not directly mention the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of batch size to manage the amount of data that computers can handle at once during training. Batch size is a hyperparameter that determines how many training examples are used in one iteration. This introduces a form of randomness because the model's weights are updated based on the gradients calculated from a subset of the training data, rather than the entire dataset.

In addition, the authors mention the use of a neural network architecture called BatNet, which is a deep convolutional neural network. BatNet was modified in this study, but the text does not provide specific details about how randomness was handled within the network architecture itself. However, it is common practice in deep learning to use techniques such as dropout and data augmentation to introduce randomness and prevent overfitting.

Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent over-reliance on specific neurons and improves the model's ability to generalize. Data augmentation involves creating new training examples by applying random transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, scaling, or flipping. This increases the size of the training set and introduces randomness, which can improve the model's performance.

The text also references the use of the Scikit-learn library, which provides tools for machine learning in Python. Scikit-learn includes functions for setting random seeds to ensure reproducibility in experiments.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does discuss the use of batch size and the modification of a deep convolutional neural network. Additionally, it is common practice in deep learning to use techniques such as dropout and data augmentation to introduce randomness and prevent overfitting. The Scikit-learn library, which is referenced in the text, provides tools for setting random seeds to ensure reproducibility.
