The provided context does not include information on the specific process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of deep learning in river health predictions and the evaluation of the model's generalizability to unseen datasets.

In general, deploying a trained deep learning model involves several steps, including:

1. Model serialization: This is the process of saving the trained model to disk so that it can be loaded and used for making predictions on new data. This is typically done using a format such as HDF5 or JSON.
2. Platform selection: The deployed model can be run on a variety of platforms, including local machines, cloud-based services, or embedded devices. The selection of the platform will depend on the specific requirements of the application, such as the need for real-time predictions, the volume of data to be processed, and the available resources.
3. Model serving: Once the model is serialized and the platform is selected, the model needs to be served so that it can receive input data and return predictions. This can be done using a variety of tools and frameworks, such as TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, or Seldon Core.
4. Monitoring and maintenance: After the model is deployed, it is important to monitor its performance and make any necessary adjustments. This can include retraining the model on new data, tuning the model's hyperparameters, or deploying new versions of the model.

It is worth noting that the context mentioned the use of TPE algorithms implemented in the CatBoost package, LightGBM package, XGBoost package, and Hyperopt package, which are used for hyperparameter tuning, not for model deployment.

Therefore, I can't provide a specific answer on how the trained deep learning model was deployed, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
