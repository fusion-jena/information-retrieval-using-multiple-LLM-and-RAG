The provided context does not give information about the specific platform used to deploy a deep learning model. It mainly discusses the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for wildfire science and the application of random forest (RF) machine learning algorithms within GEE.

GEE is a cloud-based platform that provides high-performance computing and a vast remote sensing data catalog. However, it primarily focuses on JavaScript, Python, or R application programming interfaces (APIs) and interactive development environments (IDEs) for processing data, without specifying the underlying cloud platform.

The deep learning model development and deployment process typically involve selecting a cloud platform such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine if GCP (which includes GEE) or another cloud platform was used for deploying a deep learning model.
