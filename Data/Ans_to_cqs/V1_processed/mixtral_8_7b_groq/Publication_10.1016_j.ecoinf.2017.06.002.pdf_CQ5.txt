I don't know the answer to the user's query regarding the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, as the provided context does not contain any information about deep learning pipelines or these specific datasets.

The context includes information about data repositories, such as Unidata and the USGS Science Data Catalog, as well as a study on a comprehensive ecosystem model-data synthesis using CO2 enrichment experiments. There is also information about the Zurb Foundation and the FRAMES project, which utilizes the concept of data packages for submission to a repository. However, none of these sources mention deep learning pipelines or the specific datasets the user is asking about.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the user's query based on the given context.
