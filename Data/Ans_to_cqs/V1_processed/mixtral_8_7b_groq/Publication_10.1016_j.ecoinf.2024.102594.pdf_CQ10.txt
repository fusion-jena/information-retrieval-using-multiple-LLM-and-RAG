The provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The articles mentioned in the context describe the development and application of the DeepLabV3+ algorithm for ecological informatics and remote sensing tasks, but they do not give a specific link to the code repository.

The first article by Chen et al. (2024) discusses the use of the DeepLabV3+ algorithm for analyzing the diversity of carbon-fixing bacterial communities in karst wetland soil ecosystems. However, it does not mention the code repository link.

The second article by Wang et al. (2021b) presents a house building extraction method based on the IEU-net, but it does not provide the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.

The third article by Wang et al. (2023) investigates the impacts of climate change on wetlands in the arid region of Northwestern China, but it does not mention the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.

The fourth article by Yan et al. (2020) studies aquatic microalgal and bacterial communities in a karst wetland watershed, but it does not give the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I cannot provide the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
