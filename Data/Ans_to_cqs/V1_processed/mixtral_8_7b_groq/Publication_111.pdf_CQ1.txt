The context does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the study utilizes the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency dataset for predicting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH). Therefore, it can be inferred that the data is likely collected using sensors or measurement devices deployed in the ocean. These devices could include buoys, satellites, or other oceanographic instruments that regularly measure and record oceanographic parameters. However, the specific data collection methods are not mentioned in the provided context.
