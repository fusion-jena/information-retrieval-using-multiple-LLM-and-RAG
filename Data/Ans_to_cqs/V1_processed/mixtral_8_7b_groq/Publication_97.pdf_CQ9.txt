The data repository for the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the training data for the neural network was generated from satellite images presented in Table 1, and that the evaluation of the CNN design choices performance was done using a benchmark available on GitHub (<https://github.com/ducha-aiki/caffenet-benchmark>). It is not clear if this repository contains the data used in the study or just the code for the benchmark. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific data repository for this study without further information.
