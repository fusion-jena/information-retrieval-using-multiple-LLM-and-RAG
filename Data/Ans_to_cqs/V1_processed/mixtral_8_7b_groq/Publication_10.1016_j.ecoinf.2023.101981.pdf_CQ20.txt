The provided context does not give information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions the use of the R programming language and the Kaleidoscope software for analyzing and detecting animal vocalizations, but it does not specify if GPUs, TPUs, or any other hardware accelerators were used during the model training process. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.
