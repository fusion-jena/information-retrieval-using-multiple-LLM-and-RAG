The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it does discuss various measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the models used in the study, which can provide some insight into the potential measures that could have been taken if a deep learning model was used.

To ensure the generalizability of the models, the study utilized two feature sets selected through different cross-validation (CV) processes. These feature sets were named the 'random-CV' feature set and the 'spatial-CV' feature set. The two feature sets shared six common features, and the study tested both raw and scaled versions of these features when modeling. This resulted in four feature sets to fit per model type, including raw random-CV features, scaled random-CV features, raw spatial-CV features, and scaled spatial-CV features.

The study used a random forest model, which is a type of ensemble learning model that utilizes an ensemble of classification or regression trees. Each tree is grown from a bootstrap sample of the training dataset, and represents a series of sequential decisions, in which each node of the tree is a binary split made on a predictive feature. To avoid overfitting, a random subset of features is considered when finding the optimal split at each node.

The study also used a generalized additive model (GAM), which is a type of non-parametric regression model that allows for the response variable to be a smooth function of the predictor variables. The study used priors arguments for the coefficients and intercept in the GAM model.

However, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
