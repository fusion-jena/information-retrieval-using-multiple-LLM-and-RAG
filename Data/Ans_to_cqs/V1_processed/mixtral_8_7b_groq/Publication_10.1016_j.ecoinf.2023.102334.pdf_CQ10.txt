I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of DenseNet, ViT (Vision Transformer), and a hybrid design combining Transformer with a CNN backbone for identifying sika deer. However, it does not mention or provide a link to the code repository for this project.
