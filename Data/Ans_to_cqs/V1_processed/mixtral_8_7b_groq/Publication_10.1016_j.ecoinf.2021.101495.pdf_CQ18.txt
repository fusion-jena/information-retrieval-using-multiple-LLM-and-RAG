Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, we can infer that the training duration and the use of data augmentation suggest some form of performance monitoring.

Firstly, the training duration for both models is given, which implies that the training process was monitored to ensure that it completed within a reasonable time frame. Additionally, the classification model was trained for a longer duration of 9 hours, suggesting that its performance may have been monitored more closely due to its complexity or the size of its training data.

Secondly, the use of data augmentation for the segmentation model indicates that performance was monitored during training to determine if the model was overfitting or underfitting the training data. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data. By monitoring the model's performance during training, the data augmentation factor of x12 was determined to be optimal for the segmentation model.

In summary, while there is no explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, the provided context suggests that the training duration and the use of data augmentation were used to monitor the models' performance.
