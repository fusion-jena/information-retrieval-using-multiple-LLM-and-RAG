Based on the provided context, there are no specific details about postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix. However, we can infer some possible steps based on the information given about the model development process.

First, the researchers developed a full species discrimination model consisting of 12 variables for distinguishing between fisher and marten species. This model had near-perfect classification success, misclassifying only 1 out of 532 tracks. To simplify the model, they used backward stepwise selection and found a univariable model using only variable V16, which still achieved a high species classification success rate of over 99%.

Based on this information, we can assume that the following postprocessing steps were involved after training the final univariable species discrimination model:

1. Model Evaluation: The researchers would have evaluated the performance of the final model using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
2. Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix could have been created to visualize the performance of the model. It would show the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, allowing for a better understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses.
3. Threshold Determination: Since the model is based on a single variable (V16), a threshold value (3.17) was determined to distinguish between fisher and marten species. This threshold value could have been fine-tuned during the postprocessing stage to optimize the model's performance.
4. Probability Calculation: Based on the threshold value, the probability of a track belonging to the fisher species was calculated. This probability could be useful for applications requiring a certain level of confidence in the species classification.

In summary, although the context does not explicitly mention postprocessing steps, we can infer that the researchers likely evaluated the model's performance using metrics and a confusion matrix, determined an optimal threshold value for variable V16, and calculated probabilities for species classification based on this threshold.
