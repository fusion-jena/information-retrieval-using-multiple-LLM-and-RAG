Based on the provided context, there is no information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The context discusses the development and performance of the EfficientNetV2 network, as well as other related topics such as Xception networks, Faster R-CNN algorithms, and aquatic animal detection. However, it does not mention any details about the deployment platform for the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
