The provided context does not contain specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for bird sound recognition. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation to estimate the false positive rate in detecting bird calls.

In general, data annotation techniques for computer vision tasks such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation are not directly applicable to audio data. Instead, audio data annotation typically involves labeling audio clips with the presence or absence of specific sounds or species.

In the context of bird sound recognition, the annotation process may involve labeling audio recordings with the time intervals and species of detected bird calls. This can be done manually by human annotators or semi-automatically using existing detection algorithms.

Once the audio data is annotated, it can be used to train deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for bird sound recognition. The trained models can then be retrained or used as-is to detect the target species of interest.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention data annotation techniques, it is likely that the audio data used in the bird sound recognition deep learning pipeline is annotated with time intervals and species labels for the detected bird calls.
