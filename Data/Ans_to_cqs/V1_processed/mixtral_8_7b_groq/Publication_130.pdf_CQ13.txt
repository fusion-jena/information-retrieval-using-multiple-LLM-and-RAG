The specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the provided context are the learning rate and the optimizer. The learning rate is set to a value that is 10 times smaller than the initial learning rate used during the training of the model with the ImageNet dataset. The optimizer used is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

The authors used the VGG19 CNN architecture, which is a pre-trained model on the ImageNet dataset. They initialized the model with the weights of this pre-trained network. To optimize the performance of the CNN, they used a smaller learning rate to fine-tune the model on their specific dataset.

Moreover, the authors stopped training if there was no decrease in loss for more than 10 consecutive epochs. This technique helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.

In summary, the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model described in the context are a learning rate that is 10 times smaller than the initial learning rate used during the training of the model with the ImageNet dataset and the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer. These hyperparameters were chosen to fine-tune the pre-trained VGG19 CNN architecture and optimize its performance on the specific dataset used in the study.
