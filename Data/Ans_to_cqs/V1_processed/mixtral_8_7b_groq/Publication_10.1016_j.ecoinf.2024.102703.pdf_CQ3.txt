I'm sorry, but the provided context does not contain information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the study of the spectral characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in Plateau Lakes located in Southwest China, specifically in the Erhai watershed. It discusses the materials and methods used in the study, including the study area (Lake Erhai, Lake Cibi, Lake Xihu, and the Luoshi, Yongâ€™an, and Miju Rivers) and field sampling and sample collection. The study aims to predict the nutrient status of lakes and rivers in a plateau based on DOM absorption and humification, and to develop a faster and more thorough approach to comprehending the eutrophication status of plateau lakes based on optical characteristics. However, it does not mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning.
