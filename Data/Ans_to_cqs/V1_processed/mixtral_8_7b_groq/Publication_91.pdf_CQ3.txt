Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this study. The text focuses on the dataset used for training a deep learning model to identify pollen species, including details about the number of images, how they were processed, and the training parameters for the model. However, it does not mention any specific annotation methods such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

In general, data annotation techniques for deep learning models can include:

1. Image-level annotation: This is the simplest form of annotation where the image is labeled with a single class or category.
2. Bounding box annotation: In this method, a bounding box is drawn around the object of interest in the image. This helps the model to learn the spatial location and size of the object.
3. Semantic segmentation: This is a more advanced form of annotation where each pixel in the image is labeled with a specific class or category. This helps the model to learn the shape and appearance of the object.
4. Instance segmentation: This is an extension of semantic segmentation where each instance of an object is segmented and labeled separately. This helps the model to learn the number and spatial distribution of objects in the image.

Without further information, it is not possible to determine which of these techniques were used in the study. However, based on the high accuracy achieved in classifying pollen species with a relatively small number of images per species, it is possible that a simpler annotation method such as image-level annotation was used.
