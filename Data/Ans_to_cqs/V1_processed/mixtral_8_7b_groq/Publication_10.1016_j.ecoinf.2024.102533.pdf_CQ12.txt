The provided context does not specify the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline for fish freshness classification. However, it does mention the use of machine learning models such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for fish freshness categorization.

In the study by Lalabadi, H.M., Sadeghi, M., Mireei, S.A., (2020), the authors used a multi-class artificial neural network and support vector machines to categorize fish freshness based on eyes and gills color features.

Additionally, the study by Kunjulakshmi, S., et al., (2020) developed a portable, non-destructive freshness indicative sensor for Indian Mackerel stored under ice, but it does not mention the use of deep learning models.

The studies by Mokrani, D., Oumouna, M., Cuesta, A., (2018) and Jayasundara, J.M.V.D.B., et al., (Dec. 2023) focus on fish farming conditions and automated fish grading, respectively, but do not mention the use of deep learning models.

The two studies by E. Prasetyo et al. (2024) are related to ecological informatics and do not mention the use of deep learning models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that deep learning models are not used in the pipeline for fish freshness classification. However, it is worth noting that deep learning models have been widely used in other fish-related applications such as fish species identification, fish size estimation, and fish swimming behavior analysis.
