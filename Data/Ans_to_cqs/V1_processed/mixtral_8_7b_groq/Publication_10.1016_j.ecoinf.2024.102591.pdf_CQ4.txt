Based on the provided context, there is no information about the use of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for fire scar delineation and the implementation of a machine learning-based PROSAIL-D RTM inversion to retrieve the FCOVER (fraction of cover) from post-fire Sentinel-2 (S2) scenes. It mentions the use of the Random Forest (RF) regression algorithm in GEE for building relationships between the FCOVER and the corresponding reflectance in the S2 band configuration. However, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques.

Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size of the training set and reduce overfitting. These techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, and other transformations that generate new training examples by applying random transformations to the original images. However, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer this query.
