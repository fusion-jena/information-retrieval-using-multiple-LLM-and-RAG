The provided context does not give detailed information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. However, it does mention the use of a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network with a 30-20-10 architecture. The activation functions used in the model are tansig for the first and second layers, and purelin for the output layer. The input factors for the model are population size and GDP, and the predicted output is GHGdwts (greenhouse gas emissions per unit of wastewater treatment). The data was divided into 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.

Additionally, the context also mentions the use of the Grey Wolf Optimizer Algorithm in a different study, but it is not specified if it was used in conjunction with the neural network model.

It is important to note that the selection of hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of hidden layers and nodes, activation functions, and optimization algorithms can have a significant impact on the performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, it is a common practice to tune these hyperparameters using techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to find the best combination of hyperparameters for a given problem.
