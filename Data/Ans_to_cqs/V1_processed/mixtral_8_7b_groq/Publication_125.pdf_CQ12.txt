Based on the information provided, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the description of the CNN architecture in Table 3, which includes layers such as Convolutional, Activation (ReLu), MaxPooling, Dropout, Flatten, Fully Connected, and Activation (softmax). These layers are typical in a CNN architecture. Furthermore, the context mentions specific types of CNN models such as VGG16, ResNet-50, and DenseNet121, which further confirms the use of CNN in the pipeline.
