The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link for it. The text discusses the use of high-resolution CHM data (Lang10m) and LiDAR GEDI data in various studies related to forest ecosystems. It mentions the sources from where these data sets were downloaded, but it does not provide any details about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository for it. Hence, I don't know the answer to the query.
