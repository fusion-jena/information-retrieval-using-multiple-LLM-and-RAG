Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines. However, we can infer that bounding box annotation might have been used in the underwater fish species classification study by Rathi et al. (2017) and the weather phenomenon classification study by Xiao et al. (2021). This is because these studies involved training deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on images, and bounding box annotation is a common technique for labeling objects in images for CNN-based object detection and classification tasks.

In the study by Rathi et al. (2017), a CNN was used to classify underwater fish species from images. Although the specifics of the data annotation technique are not mentioned, it can be inferred that bounding box annotation was used to label the fish species in the images. Similarly, in the study by Xiao et al. (2021), a deep CNN was used to classify weather phenomena from satellite images. Again, while the specific data annotation technique is not mentioned, it is likely that bounding box annotation was used to label the weather phenomena in the images.

On the other hand, the study by Salman et al. (2019) on real-time fish detection in complex backgrounds used probabilistic background modeling, which does not involve bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, this method models the background of the video frames and detects fish as foreground objects that deviate from the background model.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines, it can be inferred that bounding box annotation was used in some studies involving image-based object detection and classification tasks. Other methods, such as probabilistic background modeling, can also be used for specific tasks.
