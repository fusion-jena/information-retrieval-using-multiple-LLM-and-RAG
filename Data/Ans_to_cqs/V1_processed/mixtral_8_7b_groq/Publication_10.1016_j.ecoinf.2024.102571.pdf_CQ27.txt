Based on the provided context, there is no information about the deployment of a trained deep learning model. The context includes several research papers and datasets related to environmental science, such as water pollution control, greenhouse gas emissions, and wastewater treatment. While these studies may have used machine learning or deep learning models as part of their research, the context does not provide details about the process followed to deploy any trained models.

The context includes a paper by Uzlu (2021) that estimates greenhouse gas emissions in Turkey using an artificial neural network (ANN) model optimized with a grey wolf optimizer algorithm. However, the paper does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Similarly, Wang et al. (2018) studied the effects of electro-dewatering pretreatment on nitrous oxide emission involved in related functional genes in sewage sludge composting using a machine learning model. However, the paper does not provide details about the deployment of the trained model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model.
