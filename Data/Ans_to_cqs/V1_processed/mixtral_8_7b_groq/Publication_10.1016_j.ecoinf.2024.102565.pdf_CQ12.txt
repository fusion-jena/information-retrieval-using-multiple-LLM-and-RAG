The provided context does not explicitly state the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions the use of a Neural Network (NN) model, which is a type of machine learning model, but not necessarily a deep learning model. Deep learning models are a subset of neural networks with multiple hidden layers, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Transformers. 

However, the context also mentions the use of the C2RCC neural network, which is a type of neural network used for the retrieval of ocean color products in normal and extreme optically complex waters. The C2RCC neural network is a deep learning model as it has multiple hidden layers. But, the specific type of deep learning model (CNN, RNN, or Transformer) is not provided. 

Therefore, based on the given context, it can be said that a deep learning model is used in the pipeline, specifically the C2RCC neural network, but the exact type of deep learning model (CNN, RNN, or Transformer) is not specified.
