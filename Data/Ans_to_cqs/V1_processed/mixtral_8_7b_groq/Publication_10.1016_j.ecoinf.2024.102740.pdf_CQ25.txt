Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model in this study is for classification. The specific deep learning technique used is Random Forest (RF), which is a type of ensemble learning method that belongs to the category of machine learning algorithms. The RF technique is employed to classify semi-natural grasslands based on remote sensing data acquired in March, April, and May.

The RF model is used to assess Aboveground Biomass and ecological classification, which are crucial for sustainable grassland management. The model is trained using ground data points, and the total number of samples used for validation is 8. The RF technique generates an impartial internal estimate of the generalization error by the "out-of-bag" (OOB) samples, which are those not included in the training subset.

The most accurate results for RF were obtained when the maximum tree depth was set to 10 and the minimum number of samples was set to 2. The classification was performed using the System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) software (version 9.4.0).

Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning model in this study is to classify semi-natural grasslands based on remote sensing data, which is essential for assessing Aboveground Biomass and ecological classification, enabling sustainable grassland management.
