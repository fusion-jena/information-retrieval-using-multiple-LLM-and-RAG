Based on the provided context, the deep learning models are used for the purpose of image classification. Specifically, six open-source Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were selected for this task, including VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0. These models were chosen due to their ease for transfer learning and high performance on similar classification tasks.

Before implementing these models, all images were resized to the same resolution (227x197 pixels) and normalized to the [0,1] range. For model optimization, the Adam optimizer algorithm was used with a batch size of 10 and 100 epochs. The learning rates were chosen based on empirical trials over 100 epochs.

The models were then trained and evaluated based on their accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and f1-score. Among the models considered, EfficientNetB0 showed the highest performance in terms of accuracy (97.50%), sensitivity (96.00%), and f1-score (97.46%). Inception-v3 also showed high accuracy (96.88%), sensitivity (94.00%), specificity (99.75%), and f1-score (96.78%).

Therefore, based on the provided context, the deep learning models are used for image classification, specifically for classifying images into categories related to the presence or absence of Cortaderia selloana.
