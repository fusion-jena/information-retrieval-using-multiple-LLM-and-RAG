The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context provided is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the training process is evaluated using a validation set and the F1-score, a metric that combines precision and recall. The F1-score for the validation set is used to assess the model's performance. The training process might be considered complete when the validation F1-score reaches a plateau or stops improving significantly. Additionally, the authors mention the occurrence of overfitting when using large deep learning networks, which indicates that the training and validation losses may be monitored to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data. However, the specific stopping criterion is not provided in the text.
