Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used for processing wildlife camera trap images. However, it is mentioned that many ecologists have turned to artificial intelligence and machine learning models to automate the processing of large volumes of camera trap images.

The context does mention several studies and papers that have evaluated the performance of these models, such as Norouzzadeh et al. (2018), Miao et al. (2019), and Tuia et al. (2022). It is possible that the data repositories for these studies are available on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.

For example, Norouzzadeh et al. (2018) used a dataset of over 3.2 million camera trap images to train and evaluate their deep learning model for detecting and identifying wildlife. The dataset used in this study may be available on a data repository, but the context does not provide information on where it can be found.

Therefore, while the specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the context is not mentioned, there are potential sources of data repositories for similar studies available on various platforms. It would be best to contact the authors of the relevant studies or consult their papers for more information on the data repositories used.
