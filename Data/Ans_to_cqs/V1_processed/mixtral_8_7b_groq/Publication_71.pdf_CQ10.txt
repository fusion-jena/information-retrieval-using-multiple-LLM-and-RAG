I am unable to provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the given context. The context provides information on the training parameters used in DeepLabV3+, the benefits of using a NIR band in addition to RGB bands for model training, and the performance metrics of a CNN model trained with the Vasiliko dataset. However, there is no mention of the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
