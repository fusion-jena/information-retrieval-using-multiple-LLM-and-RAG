The context provided does not give specific information about the deep learning frameworks used to build the model. However, it does mention the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mask R-CNN, which are types of deep learning models. CNNs are often implemented in deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. Mask R-CNN is a popular model that is also typically implemented in deep learning frameworks, including TensorFlow and PyTorch. Therefore, it is plausible that one of these deep learning frameworks was used to build the model, but the context does not provide enough information to make a definitive statement.
