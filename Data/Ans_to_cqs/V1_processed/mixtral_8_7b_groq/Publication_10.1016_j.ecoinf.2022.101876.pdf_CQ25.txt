The deep learning model in question is a Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) model, which is used for object detection. This model serves a dual purpose: it first identifies regions within an image that contain objects, separating them from the background scene by drawing bounding boxes around those objects. Subsequently, it reviews each object and assigns a specific object classification and a confidence value. This confidence value indicates the model's certainty in the selected object class. The MegaDetector model, which is the specific instance of the Faster R-CNN model mentioned in the context, has been trained using hundreds of thousands of images labeled by manual human review. It classifies objects into one of three categories: animal (any non-human animal), human (any person), or truck (any vehicle).
