The context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text mentions the use of machine learning and deep learning tools for forecasting the percent disease incidence of Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD) under prevailing weather data. It also describes the use of artificial neural network (ANN), a type of deep learning model, and its comparison with other models for prediction accuracy. However, there is no information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.
