In the context provided, there is no direct mention of techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the importance of data selection in the context of atmospheric correction (AC) for remote sensing of aquatic environments. 

In the context of AC, one technique that could be used to address data bias is the selection of diverse data sources. This is demonstrated by the comparison of Sentinel-2 MSI and Sentinel-3 OLCI sensors for the inversion of water quality parameters. By using multiple sensors, the model can learn to handle variations in data that may be present due to differences in sensor technology or calibration.

Another technique that could be used to address data bias is stratified sampling or splitting. This method involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain characteristics, such as the location or time of data collection, and then ensuring that each subgroup is represented proportionally in the training, validation, and test sets. This can help to ensure that the model is not biased towards certain subgroups of the data.

Additionally, techniques such as oversampling and undersampling can be used to address data imbalance. If certain classes or subgroups of the data are over- or under-represented, these techniques can be used to adjust the class distribution in the training data.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss techniques for addressing data bias in the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, it does highlight the importance of data selection and diversity in the context of AC for remote sensing. Techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, and undersampling can also be used to address data bias in a deep learning pipeline.
