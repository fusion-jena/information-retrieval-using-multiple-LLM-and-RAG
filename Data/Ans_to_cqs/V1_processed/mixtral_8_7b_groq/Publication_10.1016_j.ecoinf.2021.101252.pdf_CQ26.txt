In the context provided, there is a mention of a technique used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the data was balanced by randomly duplicating presence records and deleting absence records until a balance of approximately 50:50 was obtained. This was done for the data sets used for internal assessment of accuracy in the mcfly system. The package used for this purpose is ROSE, which is implemented in R.

However, the context does not mention other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique used to ensure that the train and test sets have the same proportion of samples for each class. This can help prevent bias in the model's performance when evaluated on the test set.

Oversampling is a technique used to increase the number of samples in the minority class, while undersampling is used to decrease the number of samples in the majority class. These techniques can help balance the class distribution and prevent bias towards the majority class.

Diverse data collection involves gathering data from multiple sources or perspectives to ensure that the data is representative of the population. This can help prevent bias in the data and improve the model's performance on unseen data.

In summary, while the context provides an example of a technique used to balance the class distribution during preprocessing, it does not mention other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
