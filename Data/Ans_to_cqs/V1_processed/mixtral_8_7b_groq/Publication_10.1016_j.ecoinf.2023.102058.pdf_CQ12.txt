Based on the provided context, the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. The text discusses the application of deep learning algorithms in general to predict water quality parameters using hyperspectral data. Common deep learning models include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers. However, without further information, it is not possible to determine which of these models was used in the study.

The context does mention the use of machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and extreme machine learning. These algorithms can be used for developing semi-empirical models and for feature selection in hyperspectral data. The study focuses on predicting and mapping Chl-a and TSS contents of inland water bodies using simulated EnMAP spectra.

In summary, while the text discusses the use of deep learning algorithms for predicting water quality parameters, it does not specify the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
