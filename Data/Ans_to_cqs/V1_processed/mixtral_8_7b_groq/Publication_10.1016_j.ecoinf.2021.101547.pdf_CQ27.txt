The context does not provide direct information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized and saved for later use, as this is a common practice in deep learning. The model could have been saved in a format specific to MATLAB, the tool used for training, or it could have been exported to a more universal format such as ONNX or TensorFlow.

Additionally, the context mentions that the CNN was trained on a GeForce RTX 2070 Super GPU, which suggests that the trained model was intended to run on a similar platform. This could mean that the model was intended to be deployed on a workstation or server with a compatible Nvidia GPU.

It is also possible that the model was deployed using MATLAB's built-in tools for model deployment, such as the MATLAB Compiler or the MATLAB Coder. These tools allow users to generate standalone executables or C/C++ code from MATLAB code, which can then be deployed on a variety of platforms.

Overall, while the context does not provide specific details about the model deployment process, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized and saved for later use, and that it was intended to be deployed on a platform with a compatible Nvidia GPU.
