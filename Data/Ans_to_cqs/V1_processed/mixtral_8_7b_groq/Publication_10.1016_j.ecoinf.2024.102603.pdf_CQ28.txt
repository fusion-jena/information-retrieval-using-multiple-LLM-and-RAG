The provided context does not offer information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the differences between deep learning models and other methods like XGBoost, particularly in the context of chlorophyll fluorescence retrieval from satellite data. However, it does not mention any cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform in relation to the deployment of these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query based on the given context.
