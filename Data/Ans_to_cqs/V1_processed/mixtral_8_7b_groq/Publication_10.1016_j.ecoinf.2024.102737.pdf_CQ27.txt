The provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention some relevant steps in the context of developing and training the model.

First, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was fine-tuned and shown to outperform traditional classification methods in fish species classification. The traditional methods compared include SVM, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Sparse Representation Classifier. The CNN achieved an average classification rate of more than 90% on the LifeCLEF14 and LifeCLEF15 fish datasets, while the traditional methods generally had a significantly lower rate.

Additionally, a very deep CNN with a cross-layer pooling approach was used to reach a classification accuracy of 94.3% for fish species classification. This approach aimed to enhance the discriminative ability to handle the limited labeled training data problem.

In the case of bluespotted ribbontail ray (Taeniura lymma) recognition, the authors used a Siamese network with features extracted from a pre-trained CNN. They focused on data-efficient online classification with active learning.

The context also highlights the importance of pose handling and mentions that preprocessing the input instead of relying on data augmentation resulted in significantly better results. This approach seemingly bypassed the difficulty of the Siamese network to learn similarity in the presence of few examples.

Considering these steps, it can be inferred that the general process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model would include:

1. Training the CNN or very deep CNN on the relevant dataset
2. Evaluating the model's performance and comparing it to traditional methods
3. Implementing any necessary enhancements for discriminative ability, such as cross-layer pooling
4. Preprocessing the input data instead of relying on data augmentation
5. Serializing the trained model for deployment on the desired platform

However, the context does not provide specific details about the platform selection or the serialization process.
