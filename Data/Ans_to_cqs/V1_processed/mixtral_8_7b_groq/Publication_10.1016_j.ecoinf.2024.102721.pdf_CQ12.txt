The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is a specific type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This information is derived from the context provided in the LSTM model section, which states that the LSTM model is used for forecasting ecological water demand in an arid oasis under a drying climate scenario based on deep learning methods. The LSTM model is chosen because of its ability to effectively learn in long time sequences and its precise control of information through gate structures, making it well-suited for time series prediction.

Additionally, the structure of the LSTM model is illustrated in Figure 3, which shows the forget gate, input gate, output gate, and hidden layer that make up the LSTM memory unit. The LSTM model is used as part of a larger pipeline, but the context provided indicates that it is a key component of the deep learning methods used for this forecasting task.
