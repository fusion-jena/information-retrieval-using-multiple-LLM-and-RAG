In the deep learning pipeline, various optimization techniques can be employed to effectively train the models. However, the specific context provided does not mention any particular optimization technique used in the deep learning algorithms. Therefore, I will provide a general overview of some commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning.

One popular optimization technique is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) (Bottou, 2010), which is an iterative method for minimizing an objective function by updating the parameters in the opposite direction of the gradient. SGD is simple yet efficient, and it forms the basis for many advanced optimization algorithms.

Another widely used optimization technique is Adam (Kingma & Ba, 2015), which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation. Adam combines the ideas from both SGD with momentum and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) to adaptively adjust the learning rate during training. Adam has been found to perform well in various deep learning applications due to its ability to handle non-stationary objectives and its computational efficiency.

In the context of the oil palm yield prediction, the deep learning algorithms would likely employ an optimization technique like Adam or SGD to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual oil palm yields. These optimization techniques help find the best set of model parameters by iteratively adjusting them to reduce the training loss.

It is important to note that the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline might depend on the problem at hand, the complexity of the model, and the nature of the data. Researchers and practitioners might choose to experiment with different optimization techniques to find the one that leads to the best performance for their specific application.
