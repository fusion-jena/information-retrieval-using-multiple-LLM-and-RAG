The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics for both the training and test datasets. These metrics are calculated for each stage of the model training process, allowing for continuous evaluation of the model's performance.

The RMSE measures the standard deviation of the prediction errors, providing an understanding of how spread out these errors are. A lower RMSE indicates better model performance, as it signifies that the model's predictions are closer to the actual values. MAE, on the other hand, calculates the average magnitude of the errors in the predictions, without considering their direction. Like RMSE, a lower MAE indicates better model performance.

In this specific study, the RMSE and MAE values for the training and test datasets are presented for each model iteration. For instance, the RMSE_Train and MAE_Train values represent the model's performance on the training data, while the RMSE_Test and MAE_Test values reflect the model's performance on unseen data (the test dataset).

Comparing these metrics between the training and test datasets helps assess the model's ability to generalize from the training data to new data. If the RMSE and MAE values for the test dataset are significantly higher than those for the training dataset, it may indicate overfitting, where the model has learned the training data too well, to the point that it performs poorly on new data.

In summary, the strategy for monitoring model performance during training involves the continuous calculation of RMSE and MAE metrics for both the training and test datasets. This approach allows for the identification of overfitting and ensures that the model's performance remains optimal.
