The data augmentation techniques applied in the described deep learning pipeline consist of pitch shifting, time-shifting, and adding Gaussian white noise to the audio data. Before forming the spectrogram, three random signal transformations are applied to the audio for the delphinid tonal and biological click classes. These transformations are selected randomly from the following parameters: a pitch shift ranging from 0.5 to 1.5, time-shift of up to 300 ms, and Gaussian white noise added with powers between 1 and 2. It is important to note that these techniques differ from traditional image augmentation methods such as flipping, rotating, and scaling, as they are specifically designed for audio data processing.
