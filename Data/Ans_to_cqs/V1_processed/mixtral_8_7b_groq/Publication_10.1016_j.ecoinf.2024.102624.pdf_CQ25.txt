Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the model is used for classification, as the text mentions the classification of all input dataset combinations with each classifier. The classifiers used are Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS).

Additionally, the context discusses the accuracy assessment of the models, with the best models having overall accuracies (OAs) of 96.1% and 85.4% for 7C and 13C classes, respectively. The model performance is also shown to depend on the input datasets, with the RFE variable selection dataset providing the best accuracy for 7C and slightly worse accuracy for 13C compared to using all variables.

Furthermore, the text highlights the challenges in identifying plant populations using remote sensing in the field, particularly in shallow and eutrophic water bodies where there are large variations in plant populations due to the simultaneous presence of several phenophases and numerous other plant species. The text suggests involving machine learning techniques to gain better accuracy, implying the use of deep learning models for classification.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is likely to be for classification, specifically for the classification of plant populations in water bodies using remote sensing data.
