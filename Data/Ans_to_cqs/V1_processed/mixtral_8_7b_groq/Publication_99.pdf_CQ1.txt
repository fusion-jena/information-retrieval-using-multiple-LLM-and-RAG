Based on the provided context, there is no information given about how the raw data was collected for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses mainly on the description of the models used, their parameters, and the training process.

However, it can be inferred that the input images used for training the models were preprocessed by mean centering the image with ImageNet values and then rescaled between 0 and 1. This suggests that the input images may have been obtained from a pre-existing dataset, possibly ImageNet, which is a large-scale image recognition dataset commonly used for pre-training deep learning models.

Additionally, the Pix2Pix network was used for training, which is a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) that can learn to translate an input image to a corresponding output image. This type of network typically requires paired input-output images for training, which suggests that the raw data used for training the Pix2Pix network may have been collected as paired images.

Overall, while the context does not provide explicit information on how the raw data was collected, it can be inferred that pre-existing image datasets were used for training the models.
