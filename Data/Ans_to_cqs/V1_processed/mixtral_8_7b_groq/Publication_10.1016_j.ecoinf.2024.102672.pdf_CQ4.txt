Based on the provided context, the data augmentation technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly specified as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Instead, a feature augmentation process was carried out by including lagged features. This means that for each observation, the input features of the 1 to 5 previous days were added. Each variable is named after the original variable, followed by the number of days lagged. For example, if the original variable is temperature, the lagged features would be named temperature_1day, temperature_2days, and so on. This process provides the model with information about the previous days, which is particularly useful when dealing with time series data. The result of this process was added to the dataset as a new categorical binary variable that stored the existence of stratification or not.
