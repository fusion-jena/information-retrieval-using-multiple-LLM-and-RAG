The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, fall-out, precision, specificity, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are used to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the models in handling image-based pre-trained networks.

In the given context, the models' performance is evaluated using accuracy, which measures the percentage of correct predictions out of the total number of input samples. For instance, the EfficientNet-B0 model achieved an accuracy of 94.23% under Approach 1, while the ResNet101 model achieved an accuracy of 86.66% under the same approach.

Another important metric is precision, which measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions. For example, the InceptionV3 model has a precision of 90.00% under Approach 1.

Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive samples. The BiLSTM-LSTM-GRU model has a recall of 87.37% under Approach 3.

The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced assessment of both measures. The LSTM-BiLSTM-GRU model has an F1-score of 91.58% under Approach 2.

Fall-out, or false positive rate, measures the proportion of false positive predictions among all actual negative samples. The GRU-LSTM-BiLSTM model has a fall-out of 19.44% under Approach 1.

Specificity, on the other hand, measures the proportion of true negative predictions among all actual negative samples. The LSTM-GRU-BiLSTM model has a specificity of 89.61% under Approach 1.

These metrics are essential for comparing and selecting the best-performing models for specific tasks. In the given context, the models are evaluated based on their performance after 1000 epochs using the Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM) optimization algorithm. Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM) was initially used but discarded due to its tendency to converge on a sharp minimum, resulting in negligible accuracy.
