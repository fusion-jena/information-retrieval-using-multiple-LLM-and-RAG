Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the paper "zenodo.3243139" uses a deep learning-based denoising method for bioacoustic signals. Therefore, it is possible that the data repository for this specific pipeline is on Zenodo.

Moreover, the paper "Computational Bioacoustics with Deep Learning: A Review and Roadmap" by Stowell (2021) discusses the challenges of generating training data for deep noise reduction techniques in bioacoustics applications. The paper mentions that collecting clean recordings is infeasible in many cases, and generating synthetic training data is not always an option due to the sparsity of vocalisations in bioacoustic data. Therefore, it is important to have access to a reliable data repository for bioacoustic signals.

In addition, the paper "Finding, visualizing, and quantifying latent structure across diverse animal vocal repertoires" by Sainburg et al. (2020) presents a method for visualizing and quantifying latent structure in animal vocal repertoires using deep learning techniques. While the paper does not mention a specific data repository, it provides a link to the code and data used in the study, which may be useful for researchers in the field.

Overall, while there is no specific mention of a data repository for the deep learning pipeline in the provided context, there are resources available for bioacoustic data and code used in related studies. It is recommended to check the papers "zenodo.3243139" and "Finding, visualizing, and quantifying latent structure across diverse animal vocal repertoires" for potential data sources.
