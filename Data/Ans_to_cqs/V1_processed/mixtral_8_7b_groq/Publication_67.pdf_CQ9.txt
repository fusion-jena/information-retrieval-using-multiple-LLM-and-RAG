After reviewing the provided context, there is no clear information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The text mentions several supplementary materials and archives, but it does not specify that they have been deposited in any of the mentioned data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query. It is possible that the data repository is not publicly available or that it was not specified in the text.
