The provided context does not give specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for generating synthetic connectivity data. It is mentioned that a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model was used, which consists of a generator and a discriminator. However, the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters for this GAN model are not specified. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
