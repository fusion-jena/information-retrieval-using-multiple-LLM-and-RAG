Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used for bird species classification. The sources mainly discuss the methodology, techniques, and models used in the process. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository for this deep learning pipeline.
