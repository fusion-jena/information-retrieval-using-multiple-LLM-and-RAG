The provided context does not contain specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for agricultural applications. However, it is mentioned that deep learning techniques are increasingly being used in agriculture for various purposes, such as predicting olive tree phenology (Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Bold√∫, 2018; Katal et al., 2022). 

In general, the deep learning pipeline involves several steps, starting with collecting and preprocessing raw data. The data can come from various sources, such as sensors, surveys, or public datasets. For instance, in the context of agriculture, sensors can be used to collect data about soil moisture, temperature, and other environmental factors (Dagar et al., 2018). Surveys can be used to collect data about agricultural practices, crop yields, and other relevant information (Agriculture in 2050: recalibrating targets for sustainable intensification, 2017). Public datasets, such as those provided by government agencies or international organizations, can also be a valuable source of data for agricultural research (Abadi et al., 2015).

Once the raw data is collected, it needs to be preprocessed and cleaned to remove any errors or inconsistencies. This step is crucial for ensuring the quality of the data and the performance of the deep learning model. After preprocessing, the data is typically split into training, validation, and testing sets, which are used to train, tune, and evaluate the model (Abdar et al., 2021).

In summary, while the provided context does not contain specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for agricultural applications, it is mentioned that deep learning techniques are increasingly being used in this field. The data can come from various sources, such as sensors, surveys, or public datasets, and it needs to be preprocessed and cleaned before being used to train a deep learning model.
