The provided context does not directly discuss regularization methods used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, such as dropout and L2 regularization. However, it does contain information about a study related to carbon emissions. I will provide a brief explanation of the mentioned deep learning techniques for completeness.


In deep learning, overfitting is a common issue where a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.

Two popular regularization methods are:

1. L2 regularization: This method adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the model's weights. It encourages the model to have smaller weights, reducing the impact of individual features and helping the model generalize better.

2. Dropout: During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction of the model's hidden units to zero. This prevents the model from relying too much on specific connections, making the model more robust and less prone to overfitting.

These techniques can be applied to various deep learning models, such as neural networks, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to improve their generalization performance.
