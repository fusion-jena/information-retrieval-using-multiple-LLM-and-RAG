The deep learning pipeline in the context provided primarily uses image data formats. The database construction phase involves creating a global database of very high resolution satellite and aerial RGB images. These images are the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline. The images are then used to create five training datasets, each with examples of images with different levels of tree cover, continuous and discrete approximations, and inclusion of the auxiliary class “Non-Forest”.

There is no mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files in the provided context. Therefore, based on the information given, the deep learning pipeline in this context primarily uses image data formats.
