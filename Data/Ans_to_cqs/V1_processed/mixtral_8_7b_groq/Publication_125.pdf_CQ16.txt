The criteria used to determine when training is complete for the model used in this research is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model is trained on a training set consisting of 22,666 images, and then validated on a validation set consisting of 7554 images. It is possible that the training process was stopped based on a validation loss plateau or other performance metric on the validation set. In general, training of machine learning models is often stopped when the performance on a validation set stops improving, or when the performance on the validation set starts to degrade, indicating overfitting on the training set.

Additionally, it is mentioned that data augmentation techniques were used, but the specific details of how and when data augmentation was applied during the training process is not provided. Data augmentation can help improve the performance of the model by increasing the size and diversity of the training set, and can also help prevent overfitting.

It is also worth noting that the model used in this research is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with 14 layers, as described in Table 3 of the context. The CNN architecture consists of several convolutional layers, activation layers, pooling layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers. The output shape, parameters, and dropout rate for each layer are provided, which can give an idea of the complexity of the model.

In summary, while the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the model used in this research is not provided, it is likely that the training process was stopped based on a validation loss plateau or other performance metric on the validation set. Additionally, data augmentation techniques were used to improve the performance of the model and prevent overfitting.
