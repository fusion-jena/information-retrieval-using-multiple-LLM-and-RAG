The context provided does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models mentioned. However, it does give some insight into the architectures and techniques used in the models.

In the first study, the authors used a hyperparameter-tuned batch-updated stochastic gradient descent for plant species identification using a hybrid deep learning approach. However, the specific values of the learning rate or other hyperparameters are not provided.

In the second study, the authors used a deep learning model for quantifying sheet nacre morphogenesis using X-ray nanotomography. The model's architecture is described as a 48-layer 24 CNN with enhancement using label smoothing and factorized convolutional layers. However, the specific hyperparameters used are not provided.

In the third study, the authors used deep learning for trace elemental fingerprinting of shells and soft tissues to identify the time of blue mussel harvesting. However, the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not provided.

In the fourth study, the authors proposed a smart region mobility framework, but it does not seem to involve deep learning models or hyperparameters.

In the fifth study, the authors used a deep learning model called BivalveNet for traceability of bivalves. The model is a combination of LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM sequence neural networks. However, the specific hyperparameters used in the model are not provided.

Therefore, while the context provides some information about the architectures and techniques used in the deep learning models, it does not provide specific information about the hyperparameters used.
