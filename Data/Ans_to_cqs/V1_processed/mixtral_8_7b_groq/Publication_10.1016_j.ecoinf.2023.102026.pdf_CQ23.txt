Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the use of measures such as a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, the context does provide information about the study's use of scaling hypotheses, which may be relevant to the model's generalizability.

The scaling hypotheses suggest that models for species with similar characteristics and study areas would have more similar scales than models for species with different characteristics and study areas. Specifically, the hypotheses state that (7) models for different species would have more similar scales than models for different genera; (8) models for species from the same genus would have more similar scales than models for species from different genera; (9) models for species from the same study area would have more similar scales than models for species from different study areas; and (10) models trained with the same algorithm would have more similar scales than models trained with a different algorithm.

These scaling hypotheses suggest that the study took steps to account for potential sources of variability in the models, such as species characteristics and study area, which could affect the models' generalizability. By examining the scales of the models, the study may have been able to identify and account for potential sources of bias or overfitting, which could improve the models' ability to generalize to new data.

However, without more information about the specific deep learning model used in the study, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to the query. It is possible that the study used other measures, such as a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, to ensure the generalizability of the model, but this information is not provided in the context.
