The deep learning pipeline in the context provided does not specify particular data formats used. However, based on the variables and sources mentioned in the tables and papers, it can be inferred that the pipeline likely handles time-series data in the form of comma-separated values (CSV).

Table 1 lists various symbols, units, and sources for the dataset features. These features include soil moisture, pressure, precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, global radiation, reflected radiation, atmospheric radiation, emitted radiation, and sensibly heated flux. These variables are typically measured and recorded as scalar values at specific time intervals, fitting the description of time-series data.

The sources of the data include the Soil Moisture Probe and the Radiation Station, both of which generate time-series data. Additionally, the Eddy Covariance Station measures various atmospheric variables at high frequency, which are then aggregated to form time-series data.

In the paper by Reichstein et al. (2019), the authors mention the use of deep learning models for data-driven earth system science, implying the processing of large datasets containing time-series information.

While the context does not explicitly mention other data formats such as images, audio, or video, it is possible that the pipeline incorporates these formats if the research problem requires it. Nonetheless, the primary focus of the provided context seems to be on time-series data in CSV format.
