The provided context discusses a study related to statistical modeling and bat identification, but it does not directly mention deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in its pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a set seed function in R, which is a common method for managing randomness in statistical and machine learning models.

In general, deep learning models often involve randomness during various stages such as initialization of weights, dropout regularization, data shuffling, and batch sampling. Here are some strategies that can be employed to handle randomness in deep learning:

1. **Fixed Seed Value**: To ensure reproducibility of results, a fixed seed value can be set for the random number generator. This ensures that the same sequence of random numbers is generated every time the model is trained. In the provided context, the authors mention using the set.seed function in R, which is a similar concept.

2. **Multiple Runs**: Due to the randomness involved in deep learning models, it is a good practice to train the same model multiple times with different random seeds. This helps to understand the variability in the model's performance and provides a more robust estimate of its generalization ability.

3. **Data Augmentation**: Randomness can be introduced intentionally during data preprocessing through techniques like data augmentation. This involves creating new synthetic samples by applying random transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping) to the existing data. This helps to increase the size of the training set and improves the model's ability to generalize.

4. **Regularization**: Techniques like dropout randomly set a fraction of input units to zero during training, which helps to prevent overfitting. This introduces randomness in the model, but it is a controlled form of randomness that improves the model's performance.

5. **Batch Sampling**: In mini-batch gradient descent, a random subset of the training data is used for each update of the model's weights. This introduces randomness in the training process, which can help to improve the model's convergence properties and reduce overfitting.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not directly discuss deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in its pipeline, it does mention the use of a set seed function in R, which is a common method for managing randomness in statistical and machine learning models. In deep learning, there are several strategies that can be employed to handle randomness, including using a fixed seed value, multiple runs, data augmentation, regularization, and batch sampling.
