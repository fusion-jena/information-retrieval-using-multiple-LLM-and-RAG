Based on the provided context, there is no information that directly states the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that a model was built for each species using the Random Forest method, and the probabilities of finding high and low catches and absences of each species in the study area were predicted using corresponding predictors. The validation of the trained models was shown in Table 5, but the specific methods used for validation, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, are not mentioned.

However, it is mentioned that the mean accuracies and standard deviations of the 5 Ã— 10-fold cross-validations for each method and species are shown in Table 4. This suggests that cross-validation was used to estimate the performance of the models, which is a common technique to ensure the generalizability of a model by evaluating its performance on different subsets of the data.

In addition, the study includes a diverse dataset with various measures related to silicate, oxygen concentration, salinity, thermocline intensity, temperature, chlorophyll concentration, and sea level anomaly at different depths. Having a diverse dataset can help improve the generalizability of a model by providing a wide range of inputs and outputs for the model to learn from.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly state the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it can be inferred that cross-validation was used, and the study utilized a diverse dataset.
