The provided context discusses a study involving a deep learning model for fish species detection. Although the criteria for splitting the data into training and validation sets are mentioned, the details of the test set are not provided.

In the study, the targeted fish species dataset was divided into training and validation sets in an 8:2 ratio using a random selection process. This means that 80% of the data was allocated for training the model, and the remaining 20% was reserved for validation purposes. The validation set serves as a means to evaluate the model's performance during the training phase, ensuring that the model does not overfit or underfit the data.

However, the context does not mention any test set being used for final model evaluation. A test set is crucial for assessing the model's performance on unseen data, providing a more accurate representation of the model's ability to generalize. Ideally, the dataset should be divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing.

To summarize, the provided context explains that the fish species dataset was divided into training and validation sets using a random 8:2 ratio. However, the details of a potential test set for final model evaluation are not mentioned in the context.
