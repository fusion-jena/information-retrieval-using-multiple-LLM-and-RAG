Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the datasets used are related to economic, societal, and ecological indicators, with resolutions of 1000 meters. The economic dataset pertains to the distribution of gross domestic product, the societal dataset involves the distribution of artificial nighttime-light, and the ecological dataset covers the distribution of net primary productivity of vegetation. The sources of these datasets are from the websites of resdc.cn, tpdc.ac.cn, and earthdata.nasa.gov. These datasets were used for training and evaluating the performance of various CNN architectures, including VGG, Inception, and ResNet, in the context of landscape type classification.
