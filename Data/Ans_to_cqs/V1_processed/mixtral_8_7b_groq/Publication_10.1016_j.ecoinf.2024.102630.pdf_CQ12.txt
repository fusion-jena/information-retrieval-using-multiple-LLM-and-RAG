Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not specified. The text focuses on the data used in the study, such as MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI, CDR AVHRR NDVI, GIMMS NDVI, SPOT NDVI, administrative divisions, and DEM datasets. It also mentions the data curation and analysis process but does not mention any specific deep learning model used. Therefore, I cannot provide the information about the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
