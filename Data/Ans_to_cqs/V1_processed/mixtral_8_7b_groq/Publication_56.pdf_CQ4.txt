Based on the provided context, there is no specific mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling that were applied in a deep learning pipeline for remote sensing data. However, the paper "Deep learning in remote sensing: A comprehensive review and list of resources" by Zhu et al. (2017) provides a detailed overview of deep learning techniques used in remote sensing, which may include data augmentation.

Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the size of the training dataset and prevent overfitting. These techniques involve creating new training samples by applying random transformations to the existing data. For example, flipping involves horizontally or vertically flipping the image, rotating involves rotating the image by a certain angle, and scaling involves changing the size of the image.

In the context of remote sensing, data augmentation techniques can be useful for increasing the size of the training dataset, particularly when the available data is limited. For instance, in the paper "Hourglass-shaped network based semantic segmentation for high resolution aerial imagery" by Liu et al. (2017), the authors used data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling to increase the size of their training dataset for semantic segmentation of high-resolution aerial imagery.

Therefore, while there is no specific mention of data augmentation techniques in the provided context, it is a common practice in deep learning pipelines for remote sensing data to increase the size of the training dataset and prevent overfitting.
