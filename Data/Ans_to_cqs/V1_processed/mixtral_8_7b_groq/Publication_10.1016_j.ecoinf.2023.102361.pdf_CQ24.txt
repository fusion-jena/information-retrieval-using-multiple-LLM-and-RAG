The provided context does not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention that the datasets were randomly divided into three parts for training, validation, and testing, with 60% of the data used for training, 20% for validation, and the remaining 20% for evaluating the performance of the models.

In deep learning, randomness can be introduced in various ways, such as through the initialization of weights and biases, the order of training examples, and the use of dropout regularization. Using a fixed random seed value ensures that the same randomness is introduced in the same way every time the model is trained, making the training process reproducible.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, it does discuss various deep learning models and pipelines that are used to handle issues with datasets. For example, the traditional approach for the DeepWeeds dataset was found to be insufficient in handling inter-class similarity and intra-class dissimilarity problems. To address these issues, a patch-based pipeline was proposed, which involves dividing the input image into smaller patches and extracting features from each patch. This approach improved the model's ability to distinguish between similar weed species.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of randomness in dividing the datasets for training, validation, and testing. Additionally, it discusses various deep learning models and pipelines used to handle issues with datasets, which may involve the use of a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility.
