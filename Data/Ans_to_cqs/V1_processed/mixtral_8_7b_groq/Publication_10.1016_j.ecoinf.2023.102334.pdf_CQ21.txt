After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps involved, such as metrics calculation and generating a confusion matrix. 

Firstly, the performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics. In this specific work, the confusion matrix was employed to assess the classification accuracy of the model. The confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model (in this case, a model used for identifying sika deers). It contains information about the actual and predicted classifications made by the model. The main diagonal of the matrix represents the correct predictions made by the model for each category, while the other cells represent incorrect predictions.

The confusion matrix in this work has been normalized in the row direction, with 6 rows and 6 columns, each representing a different category. The value of the main diagonal position in the matrix represents the ratio of correct predictions for each category, while the sum of the data excluding the main diagonal position in each row represents the rate of missed detections by the model for that category. Similarly, the sum of the data excluding the main diagonal position in each column represents the number of false positives for that category.

In addition to the confusion matrix, other evaluation indicators such as accuracy and precision were calculated for each category. Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions, while precision is the ratio of the number of true positives to the total number of positives.

It is worth noting that before training the model, some preprocessing steps were taken. The acquired image data were randomly generated in an 8:2 ratio, with corresponding training and test sets. These sets were uniformly adjusted to a size of 224 Ã— 224 for network model training and accuracy testing, respectively. The training set consisted of 4674 photos, while the test set consisted of 1169 photos. To avoid experimental overfitting, the training dataset was increased to 6360 photos using random cropping, vertical flipping, and horizontal flipping.

Therefore, in summary, the postprocessing steps involved after model training include generating a confusion matrix, calculating evaluation indicators such as accuracy and precision, and interpreting the results to gain insights into the performance of the model.
