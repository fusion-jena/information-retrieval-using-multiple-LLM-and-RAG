The context provided does not explicitly mention the specific method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the Gaussian process regression (GPR) model. However, it is stated that during model fitting, hyperparameters are determined from the data using methods like maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian approaches.

Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is a common method for hyperparameter optimization where the parameters are chosen to maximize the likelihood of the observed data. This method involves creating a likelihood function based on the observed data and then finding the parameters that maximize this function.

On the other hand, Bayesian approaches involve defining a prior distribution over the hyperparameters and then updating this distribution based on the observed data to obtain a posterior distribution. The hyperparameters are then typically chosen to be the mean or mode of this posterior distribution.

Grid search and random search are two common techniques used for hyperparameter optimization in machine learning models. Grid search involves creating a grid of hyperparameter values and training the model for each combination of values. The combination that results in the best performance is then selected as the optimal set of hyperparameters. Random search, on the other hand, involves randomly sampling hyperparameter values from a given range and training the model for each sampled set of values. This approach can be more efficient than grid search, especially when the number of hyperparameters is large.

Based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine whether grid search, random search, or another method was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the GPR model. It is possible that the authors used maximum likelihood estimation or Bayesian approaches for hyperparameter optimization, but this is not explicitly stated in the context.
