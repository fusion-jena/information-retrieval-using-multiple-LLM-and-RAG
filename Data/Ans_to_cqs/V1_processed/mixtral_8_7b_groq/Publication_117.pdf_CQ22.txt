The provided context discusses a study that uses deep learning models to count wildebeest in survey images and compares the results to counts from citizen scientists. However, the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned in the text.

Based on common practice in the field of machine learning, it can be inferred that the performance of the deep learning model was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. It measures the overall performance of the model.

Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions (correctly predicted positive instances) to the total number of positive predictions. It measures the exactness of the model.

Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances. It measures the completeness of the model.

F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a balanced measure of both.

The context mentions that the deep learning model achieved high accuracy levels, but it does not provide specific values for any of these metrics. Therefore, while it can be inferred that these metrics were used to evaluate the model's performance, the actual values are not provided in the text.
