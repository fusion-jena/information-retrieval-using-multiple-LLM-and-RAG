Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications of preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning that could indirectly contribute to the model's generalizability.

Firstly, the dataset was standardized to reduce the influence of outliers. All features were normalized and scaled so that they have a similar range. This standardization helps to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model, reducing the risk of any single feature dominating the model's behavior.

Secondly, the model's performance was evaluated based on three statistical indicators: coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean bias error (MBE). While these metrics do not directly ensure generalizability, they do provide a robust measure of the model's performance on the training data, which can indirectly indicate how well the model might perform on unseen data.

Lastly, the model's hyperparameters were optimized using a grid configuration. This process involved testing different combinations of hyperparameters, including the number of decision trees, the maximum depth of the decision tree, the number of features considered by each tree when splitting a node, etc. This tuning process could potentially help to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data, thus improving its ability to generalize to new data.

However, without explicit mention of measures such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, it is unclear to what extent the model's generalizability has been explicitly addressed. Therefore, while there are indications of measures that could contribute to the model's generalizability, the context does not provide enough information to definitively answer the query.
