Based on the provided context, the criteria used to determine when the training of the random forest (RF) model is complete is not explicitly stated. However, there are some indications of how the model's performance is evaluated.

Firstly, the intermediate prediction model of the RF needs to fulfill the criteria of a P value less than 0.01. This suggests that the model's coefficients are statistically significant, and the model is a good fit for the data.

Secondly, the correlation coefficients between the observed values and the predicted values in the independent validation samples are calculated. If there is a significant correlation between the observed and predicted values, the prediction ability of the model is better. This implies that the model's predictions are consistent with the actual values, and the model is accurate.

Thirdly, the proportion of explained variance and the root mean square error (RMSE) are used to evaluate the model's performance. In the case of the RF model, the proportion of explained variance is between 91% and 92%, and the RMSE is 141.124 ion/cm3. These values suggest that the RF model has a high prediction accuracy and good fitting effect.

Lastly, the model's stability is verified using independent test data for 10-fold cross-validation. The average R2 is 0.931, and the average RMSE is 141.124 ion/cm3, indicating that the RF model has high simulation accuracy and good stability.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention validation loss plateau as a criterion for determining when the training of the RF model is complete, it does provide several other indicators of the model's performance, such as P value, correlation coefficients, proportion of explained variance, RMSE, and cross-validation results. These indicators suggest that the model's training is complete when it shows good accuracy, fitting effect, and stability.
