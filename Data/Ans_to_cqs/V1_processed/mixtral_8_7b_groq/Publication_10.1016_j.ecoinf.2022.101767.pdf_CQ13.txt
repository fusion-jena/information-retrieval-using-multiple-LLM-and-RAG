I don't have enough information to provide the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. The provided context focuses on the methodology used to collect and analyze the data, but it does not mention any details about the deep learning model's hyperparameters. Hyperparameters are important configuration variables in a machine learning algorithm, such as learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, and number of units in each layer. These parameters are typically determined through experimentation and tuning to achieve the best performance for a specific task. Without access to the original research or additional details, I cannot provide the specific hyperparameters used in this study.
