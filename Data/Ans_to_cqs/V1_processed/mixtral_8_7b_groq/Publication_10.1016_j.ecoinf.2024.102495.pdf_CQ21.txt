Based on the provided context, there are several postprocessing steps involved after the model training.

Firstly, the performance of each configuration is tested, as shown in Figure 8 of the document. The configurations refer to the combination of parameters in the convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning model. The performance metrics used in this study include accuracy and precision, as stated in Table 4.

Secondly, a confusion matrix is created to evaluate the model's performance on the binary classification test. A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model (in this case, the CNN model) on a set of test data for which the true values are known, as shown in Table 5. It allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm and can be used to determine the areas where the model is performing well and where it is not.

Thirdly, various performance measures are calculated based on the confusion matrix. These measures include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, weighted accuracy, and micro F1. These metrics provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance than just accuracy or precision.

Lastly, the scatterplot in Fig. 11 illustrates the performance of Model 1 in each running fold of the model training for binary classification. It shows the distribution of the model's performance across multiple runs, which can help identify any variability or inconsistency in the model's performance.

Therefore, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include performance testing, confusion matrix creation, performance measure calculation, and scatterplot illustration. These steps provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance and help identify areas for improvement.
