The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a transformer-based network, as described in the context. This model is constructed for the end-to-end classification of environmental microbes (EMs) and is named EMViT-Net. Although the ViT (Vision Transformer) component of the model cannot perform better classification on its own, the combination of ViT with a self-attention module and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) achieved the best classification results. This demonstrates that the transformer-based model, along with the CNN and self-attention module, is well-suited for the classification of EMs.

Additionally, the context states that a separable convolutional parameter-sharing attention block is used in the model, which allows the model to capture more local and global attention features. This further enhances the model's ability to classify different environmental microbes efficiently and reduce complexity.

In summary, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a transformer-based network, specifically the EMViT-Net model, which combines ViT, a self-attention module, and a CNN. The model also includes a separable convolutional parameter-sharing attention block for enhanced classification capabilities.
