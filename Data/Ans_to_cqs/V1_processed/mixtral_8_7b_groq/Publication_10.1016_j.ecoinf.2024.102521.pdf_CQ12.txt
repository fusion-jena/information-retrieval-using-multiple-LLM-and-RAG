Based on the provided context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident in the description of the "STARdbi\_train" step, which specifies that a classification model (ResNet152) in the form of a binary pickle file is output. ResNet152 is a type of CNN that was introduced in the paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" by He et al. (2015). The use of a CNN model is also consistent with the purpose of the pipeline, which is to identify and count trapped specimens in ecological monitoring, a task that involves image classification.
