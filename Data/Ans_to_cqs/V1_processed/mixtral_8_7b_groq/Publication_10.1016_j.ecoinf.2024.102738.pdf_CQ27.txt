The provided context does not include information about the deployment of a trained deep learning model, including model serialization and platform selection. The context focuses on the creation and validation of land use and land cover (LULC) classifications using spectral indices and random sampling techniques in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform.

The LULC classification process involved the calculation of various spectral indices, such as NDVI, EVI, SAVI, BSI, MNDWI, and NDMI, using formulas based on different spectral bands. These indices were calculated for each dataset, ranging from Dataset 1 to Dataset 31.

Training and testing samples were determined using Chuvieco's (2020) guidelines, which recommend at least 196 test points for categorical variables. A simplified random sampling method was employed to effectively capture variability within each class and improve the classification.

The land cover classes were based on the CLC methodology, with descriptions, codes, and RGB colors provided in Table 3. The study followed Congalton (1991) and Hay (1979), ensuring at least 50 pixels per thematic class in the training areas.

In summary, while the context offers insights into the LULC classification process using spectral indices and random sampling techniques, it does not contain information about the deployment of a deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
