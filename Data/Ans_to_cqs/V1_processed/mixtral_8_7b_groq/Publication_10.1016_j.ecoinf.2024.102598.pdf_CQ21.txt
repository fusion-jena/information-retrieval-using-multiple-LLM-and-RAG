Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps or confusion matrix calculation. However, it is mentioned that several metrics, including AUC, TSS, Kappa, and phi, were used to assess the performance of machine learning models (MLMs). The Kruskal-Wallis test was also conducted to determine if there was a significant difference in prediction accuracy among the classifiers.

Moreover, the context discusses the validation of MLMs using robust statistical measures like kappa, TSS, and AUC provided by the 'sdm 1.1-8' package. Model complexity was evaluated by computing the difference between the AUC (train) and AUC (CV), represented as Δ AUC. These metrics were used to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of each MLM.

In summary, based on the given context, the postprocessing steps after model training include the calculation of various metrics such as AUC, TSS, Kappa, and phi, as well as evaluating model complexity using Δ AUC. However, there is no information about other postprocessing techniques like saliency maps or confusion matrix calculation.
