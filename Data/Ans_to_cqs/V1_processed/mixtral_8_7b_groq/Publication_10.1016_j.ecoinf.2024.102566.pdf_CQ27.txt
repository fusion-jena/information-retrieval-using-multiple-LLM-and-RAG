The text provided does not give information on the specific process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. It mainly focuses on the method used for biomass estimation in different types of forests (needleleaf, broadleaf, and mixed) based on field-collected data and machine learning methods. The authors mention that due to the insufficiency of high-quality training samples, they employed a low data dependency method that integrates forest inventory data with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation. However, the text does not provide details about the deployment of the trained model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
