The text provided does not give detailed information about the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. However, it does offer some context regarding the training process that can help infer certain aspects of the deployment.

During the training phase, the models were trained and executed three times with different random initializations and data folds. This was done to ensure the model's performance was not dependent on a particular data split or initialization. The best model was selected based on the validation loss, using an early stopping procedure with a patience of 10 epochs to prevent overfitting.

The networks were based on VGG, ResNet, and Xception architectures, with modifications mainly in the block of fully connected layers. Residual blocks were used at the architecturesâ€™ stems, and data augmentation was applied to all extracted patches.

Considering this information, we can infer the following steps were likely taken to deploy the trained deep learning model:

1. Model serialization: After training and selecting the best model based on performance, the model was likely saved or serialized to disk. Model serialization is the process of saving the model's architecture, weights, and other relevant information into a file, allowing the model to be easily loaded and used for inference. Common serialization formats include HDF5, JSON, and Protocol Buffers.

2. Platform selection: The choice of platform for deployment depends on factors such as the required inference speed, available resources, and integration with existing systems. Common platforms for deep learning model deployment include local servers, cloud services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), and edge devices (e.g., smartphones, embedded systems). The text provided does not give information on the chosen platform.

3. Model adaptation: Depending on the chosen platform, the model might need to be adapted for efficient deployment. For example, when deploying to edge devices, the model might need to be quantized or pruned to reduce its size and computational requirements.

4. Inference: Once the model is deployed on the chosen platform, it can be used for inference, predicting new, unseen data based on the learned patterns during the training phase.

In summary, while the text provided does not offer explicit details about the process of deploying the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized, and the choice of platform and model adaptation steps were taken according to the specific requirements of the deployment scenario.
