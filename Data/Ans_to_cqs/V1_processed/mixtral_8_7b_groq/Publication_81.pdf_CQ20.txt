The context provided does not give information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions the use of a deep learning model for classifying fish species using DNA barcode sequences, but it does not specify the hardware used for training. The paper does discuss the challenges of training deep learning models on high-dimensional genetic data, such as the time-consuming nature of training and the risk of overfitting on small datasets. To address these challenges, the paper uses Elastic Net for regularization and feature selection, which can help improve the model's performance and reduce training time. However, the specific hardware resources used for training are not mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
