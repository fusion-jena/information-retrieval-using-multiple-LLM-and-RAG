The provided context does not contain information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The mentioned study by G.-Y. Shi et al. (2021) used a random forest model implemented in R statistical software, but there is no information regarding deep learning or a code repository. Deep learning typically involves the use of specific libraries and frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras, which are not mentioned in the context. Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the code repository as it is not specified in the given information.
