The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it does mention the use of NASA’s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) lidar mission in the study by Duncanson et al., 2022. GEDI is a spaceborne lidar mission that provides high-resolution laser ranging observations of the Earth’s forests and topography.

Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) data can be processed using deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for various applications such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and time series analysis. However, the context does not provide information on the specific deep learning model used in the pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
