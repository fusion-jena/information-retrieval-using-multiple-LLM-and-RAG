The provided context does not contain information about the use of deep learning or any of the standard datasets in deep learning such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The research process outlined in the figure and the text focuses on the use of ecological data, specifically changes in land usage and species distribution in response to urban development. Seven machine learning models were used for species distribution modeling, but these are not deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
