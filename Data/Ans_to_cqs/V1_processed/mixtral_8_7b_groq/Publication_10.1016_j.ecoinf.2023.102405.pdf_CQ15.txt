The specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that the model parameters are updated using an optimizer, which suggests the use of some optimization technique.

Common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad. SGD is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters by taking a step in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. Adaptive optimization algorithms, such as Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad, adjust the learning rate for each parameter individually, allowing for faster convergence and better performance.

Without further information, it is not possible to determine which optimization technique was used in this specific deep learning pipeline. However, based on the common practices in deep learning, it is likely that one of the aforementioned optimization techniques was used.
