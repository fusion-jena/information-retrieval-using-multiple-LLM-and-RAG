The provided context discusses the use of camera traps as a method for collecting raw data in the context of biodiversity monitoring and species identification using deep learning techniques. However, it does not mention other methods such as surveys or public datasets.

In the field of biodiversity monitoring, camera traps are a popular method for collecting image data. Camera traps are automated cameras that are triggered by motion or heat, allowing them to capture images of wildlife in their natural habitat. This method has been widely used for studying the distribution and behavior of various animal species, as well as for monitoring endangered species (Wang et al., 2021; Weingarth et al., 2013).

The use of camera traps for data collection has been facilitated by the development of machine learning algorithms for species identification. For instance, Xi et al. (2021) developed an "Image filtering and labelling assistant" (IFLA) that expedites the analysis of data obtained from camera traps. The IFLA is designed to filter out images that do not contain animals, reducing the amount of manual work required for data analysis. Similarly, Wei et al. (2020) developed a tool called "Zilong" to identify empty images in camera-trap data.

While camera traps are a popular method for data collection in the context of biodiversity monitoring, other methods such as surveys and public datasets are also used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines. Surveys can be used to collect data on various phenomena, such as human behavior or environmental conditions. Public datasets, on the other hand, provide a wealth of data that can be used for training and testing machine learning models. For instance, the ImageNet dataset is a large-scale dataset of images that has been widely used for training and evaluating computer vision models (Deng et al., 2009).

In summary, while the provided context focuses on the use of camera traps for data collection in the field of biodiversity monitoring, other methods such as surveys and public datasets are also used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines. Camera traps are a popular method for data collection in this field due to their ability to capture images of wildlife in their natural habitat, facilitating the development of machine learning algorithms for species identification.
