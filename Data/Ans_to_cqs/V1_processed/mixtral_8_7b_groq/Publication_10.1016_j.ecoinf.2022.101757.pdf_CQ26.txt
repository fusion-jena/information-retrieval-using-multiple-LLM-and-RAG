The provided context discusses the use of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to improve the detail of skyline delineation in the context of semantic segmentation, but it does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide an answer to the query.

However, I can provide some general techniques that are commonly used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline:

1. Stratified sampling: This technique involves dividing the dataset into strata based on the distribution of the target variable, and then randomly sampling an equal number of instances from each stratum. This ensures that the training and testing sets have a similar distribution of the target variable.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class in the dataset to balance it with the majority class. This can be done by randomly duplicating instances of the minority class or by generating synthetic instances using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class in the dataset to balance it with the minority class. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of instances from the majority class or by using techniques such as Tomek's Links to remove instances that are close to the boundary between the two classes.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help to reduce bias by ensuring that the dataset includes instances from all relevant subgroups.

These techniques can help to improve the fairness and generalizability of deep learning models by reducing bias in the training data. However, the specific technique used will depend on the characteristics of the dataset and the problem being solved.
