Based on the provided context, there is no information about the use of a deep learning model in the development of the equitable nutrient reduction decision support tool. The text focuses on the framework of the tool, its features, and the implementation of Best Management Practices (BMPs) for nutrient reduction. It discusses various mapping and filtering options within the tool but does not mention any specific hyperparameters related to a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query using the given context.
