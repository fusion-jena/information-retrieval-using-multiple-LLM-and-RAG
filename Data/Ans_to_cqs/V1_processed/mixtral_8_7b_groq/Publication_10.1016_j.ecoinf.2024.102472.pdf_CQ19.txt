The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used to build the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLPNNs) for estimating carbon stocks. It also discusses the use of Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for predictor variable selection.

ANNs and MLPNNs can be implemented in various deep learning frameworks, including TensorFlow and PyTorch. Therefore, it is possible that either of these frameworks was used to build the ANN or MLPNN model for carbon stock estimation.

On the other hand, XGBoost is a specific machine learning algorithm that is commonly used for regression and classification tasks. It is not a deep learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch, but rather a library for implementing gradient boosting machines.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework was used to build the ANN or MLPNN model, it is possible that either TensorFlow or PyTorch was used. Additionally, XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm, was used for predictor variable selection.
