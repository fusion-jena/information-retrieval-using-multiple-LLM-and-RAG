The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the study described is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the training process was stopped when a sufficiently low error rate was achieved. Specifically, the initial training of the deep learning CNN on 7362 labelled images resulted in an error rate of 11.95%, and further fine-tuning of the model by unfreezing the entire model and training at a 10-fold lower learning rate (10âˆ’4) resulted in a final model with an accuracy of 94.8% (error rate of 5.2%).

It is also possible that the training process was stopped based on the validation loss plateauing or decreasing only slightly over a certain number of epochs. This is a common approach to determine when to stop training, as it helps to prevent overfitting of the model to the training data. However, without explicit mention of this criterion in the provided context, it is difficult to confirm.

In addition, the study mentions that data augmentation was used to help generalize the model, which can also contribute to preventing overfitting and improving the performance of the model. The fastai get\_transforms function was used with arguments for vertical flipping, limiting overexposure, disabling zooming, and reducing memory load on the GPU. These transformations can help to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Overall, while the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in the study described is not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that a sufficiently low error rate was achieved and that measures were taken to prevent overfitting and improve generalization of the model.
