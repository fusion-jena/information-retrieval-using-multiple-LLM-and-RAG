Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to determine when the training of the FERM model is complete. The document mainly focuses on the description of the FERM model's parameters, example values, and validation performance statistics.

However, in general, machine learning models like the FERM model typically use one or a combination of the following criteria to determine when training is complete:

1. Validation loss plateau: Training stops when the validation loss does not decrease for a certain number of epochs or iterations, indicating that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data.
2. Early stopping: Training stops when the validation loss starts increasing, even if the training loss is still decreasing, to prevent overfitting.
3. Monitoring other metrics: Training can also be stopped based on other metrics, such as accuracy, precision, or recall, if they reach a satisfactory level or stop improving.

It is possible that the FERM model uses one or more of these criteria to determine when training is complete, but the context does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion.
