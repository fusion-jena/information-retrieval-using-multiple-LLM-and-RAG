The provided article does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for oil palm yield prediction. However, it is mentioned that comprehensive datasets are used in the study.

In general, data annotation techniques for deep learning can include:

1. Image labeling: This is the process of assigning a class or category to an entire image. For example, an image containing an oil palm tree could be labeled as 'oil palm'.

2. Bounding box annotation: This involves drawing a box around an object of interest in an image and labeling it. For instance, bounding boxes can be drawn around individual oil palm trees in satellite images and then labeled accordingly.

3. Semantic segmentation: This is the process of dividing an image into multiple segments or regions, each representing a specific class or category. For example, an image of an oil palm plantation can be segmented into regions representing oil palm trees, soil, and other vegetation.

4. Instance segmentation: This is a more advanced form of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and labeled individually. For example, each individual oil palm tree would be segmented and labeled in an image of an oil palm plantation.

5. Landmark annotation: This involves identifying and labeling key points or landmarks on an object within an image. For instance, landmarks could be placed on the leaves or fruits of an oil palm tree to aid in yield prediction.

The choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific requirements of the deep learning pipeline and the nature of the data being used. For oil palm yield prediction, techniques such as image labeling, bounding box annotation, and semantic or instance segmentation could be useful for identifying and quantifying oil palm trees in images. However, the specific techniques used in the study mentioned in the article are not provided.
