Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance was evaluated after training it with different ratios of training data. This was done to understand the impact of data split on the final accuracy of wetland mapping. The training ratio was varied from 10% to 90% in increments of 10%, and the classification results were analyzed for each case. This approach provided insights into the required amount of data to reach an acceptable wetland accuracy level, which is particularly useful when there is a limited number of reference data in a project.

Moreover, the context provides information about the hardware configurations used for the experiments, which could be relevant for monitoring the computational cost of training the models. However, it does not explicitly mention any strategy for monitoring the model performance during training.

In summary, while there is no explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, the context suggests that the model's performance was evaluated after training it with different ratios of training data. This approach provided insights into the impact of data split on the final accuracy of wetland mapping.
