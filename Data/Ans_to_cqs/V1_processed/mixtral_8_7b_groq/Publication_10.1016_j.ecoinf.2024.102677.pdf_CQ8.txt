Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several research papers and a book chapter, but none of them mention or provide a link to a code repository on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

The first two pieces of context are research papers related to deep learning methods for understanding rural landscapes and river classification. While these papers discuss the methodologies and results of their respective studies, they do not provide any information about the code repository.

The third piece of context is a book chapter about deltas in the Anthropocene, which discusses the impact of human activities on deltas and their ecosystems. This chapter does not mention any deep learning pipeline or code repository.

The fourth piece of context is a research paper about contradictions in the concept of sustainable development. This paper does not discuss deep learning or provide any information about a code repository.

Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline.
