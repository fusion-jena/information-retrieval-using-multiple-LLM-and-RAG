The provided context does not mention or give information about a deep learning pipeline or a code repository for it. The study described in the context used the BIOMOD2 package in R to build ensemble models for predicting the distribution of study species. The models used were regression-based and machine-learning models, not deep learning models. The context also does not mention or provide a link to any code repository on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I am unable to provide the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline.
