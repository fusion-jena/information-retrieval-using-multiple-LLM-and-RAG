The hyperparameters of the random forest (RF) model are optimized using repeated cross-validations performed with a specific number of folds and repetitions for each dataset. The number of trees in the forest is determined by running the model multiple times with different numbers of trees. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization.

For the best split selection measurement, the Gini Index is used. The number of variables used for each node (mtry) is automatically selected by using repeated cross-validations with 10 folds and 10 repetitions for the seagrass meadow models, while 5 folds and 5 repetitions are used for species meadow models.

The available validation dataset is used to create a confusion matrix for image classifications. Based on the confusion matrix, overall (O.A.), producer (P.A.), and user (U.A.) accuracy for each classified class are calculated. O.A. represents the proportion of correctly classified validation samples to the total number of validation samples, irrespective of class. P.A. quantifies the proportion of accurately classified samples for each class, while U.A. measures the proportion of correctly identified samples for each predicted class.

The table provided compares the performance of different RF models generated for the classification of presence/absence of seagrasses (seagrass meadows) and species classification (4 classes, species meadows) for 2010. The models use different image dates and input variables, and the number of classes and mtry vary for each model. However, the context does not mention any specific method for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search.
