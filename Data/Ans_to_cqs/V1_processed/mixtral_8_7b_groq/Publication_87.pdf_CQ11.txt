Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. There is no mention of any link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context focuses on explaining the workflow of the deep learning pipeline for species identification and spatial co-occurrence quantification using a dataset of labelled images. However, it does not provide information about where the dataset can be accessed or downloaded. Therefore, I am unable to provide the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
