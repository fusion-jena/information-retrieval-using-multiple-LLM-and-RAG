The deep learning pipeline in the given context uses satellite image data in the form of multi-spectral images for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. The specific data formats used are not explicitly mentioned, but based on the information provided, we can infer that the input data is likely in the form of multi-band image files.

The input data consists of four basic channels from SPOT6 satellite images, namely Red, Green, Blue, and Near Infra-Red. Additionally, six neo-channels are derived from these basic channels, which are NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), MSAVI (Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index), MNDWI (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index), L, c3, and ExG (Excess Green). These neo-channels are non-linear combinations of the raw channels, which provide additional information to improve the classification performance.

Furthermore, land cover (LC) information can also be used as input for land use classification. In this case, LC mapping is performed first, and the max-likelihood LC label is added as an input channel for the LU (land use) mapping.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline for LULC classification in this context uses multi-spectral image data with additional derived channels as input.
