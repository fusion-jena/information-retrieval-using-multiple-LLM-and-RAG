The provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the development of a Res_AUNet network for water sun glint detection in UAV water images, including the reduction of 3 Ã— 3 convolutional kernels and the incorporation of a residual structure to mitigate overfitting. However, it does not specify any methods used to address data bias such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
