Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does mention the use of deep convolutional neural networks (D-CNNs) such as AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, GoogleNet, and Inceptionv3. These networks are often pre-trained on large-scale datasets like ImageNet, which may already include data augmentation techniques during training.

For instance, ImageNet includes random horizontal flipping, random cropping, and color jittering (brightness, contrast, and saturation adjustments) as data augmentation techniques. Therefore, if the D-CNNs used in the study were pre-trained on ImageNet, these data augmentation techniques would have been applied during the pre-training process.

In addition, the context describes a method for creating a visual vocabulary (VV) by extracting features from small patches of underwater images using handcrafted descriptors and D-CNNs. Although not explicitly stated, it is possible that data augmentation techniques were applied during this feature extraction process to increase the diversity of the extracted features.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is possible that techniques such as random horizontal flipping, random cropping, and color jittering were applied during pre-training of the D-CNNs on datasets like ImageNet. Additionally, data augmentation techniques might have been used during the feature extraction process for creating the visual vocabulary. However, without further information, this remains speculative.
