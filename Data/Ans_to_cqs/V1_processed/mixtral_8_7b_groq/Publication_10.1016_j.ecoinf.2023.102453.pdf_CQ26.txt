The provided context discusses the process flow of a study involving model training and deployment for image classification, particularly in the context of camera trap datasets. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing include:

1. Stratified splitting: This method involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain criteria (e.g., class labels) and then ensuring that each subgroup is proportionally represented in the training, validation, and test sets. This helps maintain the balance and diversity of the dataset throughout the deep learning pipeline.
2. Oversampling: In cases where certain classes are underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from these classes. This can be done either by duplicating existing instances or by generating synthetic instances using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Undersampling: Conversely, if certain classes are overrepresented in the dataset, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of instances from these classes. This can be done either by randomly selecting a subset of instances or by using more sophisticated methods like Tomek links or Edited Nearest Neighbors.
4. Diverse data collection: Addressing data bias starts with collecting a diverse and representative dataset. This includes considering various factors like geographical location, time of day, weather conditions, and animal behavior to ensure that the dataset captures the natural variability of the target subject.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, it does discuss the importance of pre-processing, such as image resizing, and the use of pre-trained models for transfer learning. These techniques can help mitigate data bias by leveraging the knowledge and features learned from large, diverse datasets and applying them to smaller, more specific datasets. However, the context does not provide enough information to determine if these techniques were explicitly used to address data bias in this particular study.
