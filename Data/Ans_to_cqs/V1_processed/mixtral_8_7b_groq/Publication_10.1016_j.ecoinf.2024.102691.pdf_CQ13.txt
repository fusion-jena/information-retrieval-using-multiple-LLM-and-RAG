The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, as described in the provided context, include the learning rate and optimizer. The model was trained using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer. The initial learning rate was 0.01, and a cycle learning rate of 0.2 was also used. 

During model training, the input image size was set to 512 Ã— 512 and the maximum batch size was limited to 4. To prevent underfitting, all models were ensured to follow back-propagation after accumulating the batch size 32 times. 

However, it's important to note that the context provides detailed information about a specific type of attention mechanism used in the YOLOv5 network, known as depth-attention. This mechanism has its own set of parameters, but they are not referred to as hyperparameters in the traditional machine learning sense. The depth-attention weights are not updated during training and remain fixed throughout the learning process. 

The paper compares and tests this attention mechanism against other methods and fruits using different input modals and fusion techniques. The impact of using multi-modal information on model performance is also discussed. 

In summary, the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, according to the provided context, are the learning rate and the optimizer (SGD). The model was trained with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and a cycle learning rate of 0.2. The input image size, batch size, and other training details are also provided, but these are not typically referred to as hyperparameters.
