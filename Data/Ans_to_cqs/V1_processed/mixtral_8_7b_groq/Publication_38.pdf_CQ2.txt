The deep learning pipeline can use various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV. The provided context includes several examples of deep learning applications for audio data. For instance, Piczak (2015) used environmental sound data for classification with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Salamon and Bello (2016) also employed CNNs for environmental sound classification, using data augmentation techniques. Hershey et al. (2016) presented CNN architectures for large-scale audio classification. These studies demonstrate the use of audio data in deep learning pipelines.

In the context of audio data, the deep learning pipeline typically involves processing time-series data, such as sound waveforms, into a suitable format for deep learning models. This preprocessing often includes transforming the raw waveform data into a spectrogram representation, which can be used as a 2D image-like input for CNNs. For example, the study by Goeau et al. (2016) on bird identification used spectrograms as input data for their deep learning models.

While the context does not explicitly mention the use of video or CSV data formats in deep learning pipelines, it is still possible to use these formats. Video data can be preprocessed into a sequence of frames, which can then be treated as a series of images for deep learning models. CSV data, on the other hand, can be used for supervised learning tasks where each row represents a data point with labeled features.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline can use various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV. The provided context mainly focuses on audio data, where time-series waveform data is transformed into spectrograms for CNN-based models. However, deep learning pipelines can also handle video data (as a sequence of frames) and CSV data (for supervised learning tasks) by applying appropriate preprocessing techniques.
