The provided context does not contain information about the use of a deep learning model or any platform (such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) that it might have been deployed on. The text focuses on the use of the GFR (Generalized Framework of Resource Selection) models for analyzing ecological datasets.

In section 5.2.1, the sparrow population dataset is discussed, and it is mentioned that it was addressed more efficiently under the GFR family of models. Similarly, in section 5.2.2, the wolf dataset is discussed, and it is mentioned that it was used in Matthiopoulos et al. (2011) to fit the original GFR model. However, there is no mention of a deep learning model or any cloud platform.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
