The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the setting of a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of Conditional Random Fields (CRF) as a strategy to improve the detail of skyline delineation in the context of semantic segmentation.

CRF is a type of probabilistic graphical model that is used to improve the accuracy of pixel-level classification in image segmentation tasks. It does this by incorporating contextual information from neighboring pixels to refine the initial classification provided by a deep learning model. This can help to reduce the impact of randomness in the initial classification by taking into account the overall context of the image.

Another way to handle randomness in deep learning models is by setting a fixed random seed value. This ensures that the same initial random weights are used for each training run, which can make the training process more reproducible. Additionally, techniques such as data augmentation, where artificial data is generated by applying random transformations to the original data, can help to increase the robustness of the model to random variations in the input data.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of CRF as a strategy to improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation, which can help to reduce the impact of randomness in the initial classification. Additionally, techniques such as setting a fixed random seed value and data augmentation can also be used to handle randomness in deep learning models.
