The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves audio data, as it refers to the manual validation of song recordings, and the use of software for sound analysis. Additionally, there is a reference to a user-friendly interface called Arbimon, which may be used for visual and acoustic validation of the recordings.

The context also mentions the use of "recordings" and "total time" spent on analyzing the dataset, which further supports the assumption that the pipeline involves audio data. However, the specific format of the audio data (e.g., WAV, MP3, FLAC) is not specified.

Therefore, the answer to the query is:


The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves audio data, possibly in the form of sound recordings. The specific format of the audio data is not specified.
