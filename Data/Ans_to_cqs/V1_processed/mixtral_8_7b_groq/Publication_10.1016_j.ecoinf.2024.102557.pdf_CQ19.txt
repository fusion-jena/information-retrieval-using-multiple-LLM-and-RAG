Based on the provided sources, there is no specific mention of which frameworks were used to build deep learning models for ecological applications. However, we can make some educated guesses based on the general knowledge of the field.

Deep learning frameworks are software libraries that allow developers to build and train neural networks. Some of the most popular deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras.

In the context of ecological research, Christin et al. (2019) mentioned the use of deep learning techniques for ecological applications, but they did not specify which frameworks were used. Similarly, Cejka et al. (2020) used deep learning to predict the potential distribution of truffles under climate change, but they did not mention the specific framework used.

Chang (2023) used machine learning and deep learning techniques for biodiversity estimation, but again, the specific framework used is not mentioned. However, since Chang's work was published in 2023, it is possible that more recent deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch 2.x were used.

In summary, while the specific deep learning frameworks used in ecological research are not explicitly mentioned in the provided sources, it is likely that popular frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch were used.
