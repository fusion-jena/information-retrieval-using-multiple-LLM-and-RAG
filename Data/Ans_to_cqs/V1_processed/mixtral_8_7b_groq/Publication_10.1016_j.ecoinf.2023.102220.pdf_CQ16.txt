Based on the provided context, there are no specific details about the criteria used to determine when the training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, the text describes a method for predicting outbreaks in an aphid population using a predictor based on a time series of aphid observations.

The method involves selecting a threshold value, $x^* = 200$, based on the number of aphid species collected in traps related to the economic threshold of 10% of plants infected by aphids. The method's accuracy is then evaluated using different percentages of training data obtained from the initial observations of the aphid time series.

The value of $d^*$ is also defined as a threshold for prediction, and it is used to determine whether a new event will occur at the next time step. Specifically, if the computed association coefficient between the new observations and each row of a matrix $P'$ is greater than or equal to $d^*$, the method predicts that a new event will occur. Otherwise, it predicts that no event will occur.

The values of $m$ and $d^*$ are chosen using k-fold cross-validation to optimize the method's accuracy. The method's predictions are then evaluated based on true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention validation loss plateau or any other criteria for determining when the training is complete, the method's accuracy is evaluated using cross-validation and the prediction performance is assessed using true and false positive and negative rates.
