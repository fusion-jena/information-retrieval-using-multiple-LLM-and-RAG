The provided context does not contain specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention various studies that have used different types of data.

For instance, Mohseni et al. (2003) studied potential changes in fish habitat in U.S. streams due to global warming, which implies the use of hydrological or limnological data. Park et al. (2003) applied artificial neural networks for patterning and predicting aquatic insect species richness in running waters, suggesting the use of entomological data. Patz et al. (1998) and Reiter (2001) discussed dengue fever epidemic potential and climate change's impact on mosquito-borne diseases, indicating the use of epidemiological and meteorological data. Revich et al. (2012) studied climate change and zoonotic infections in the Russian Arctic, likely involving veterinary or medical data.

In addition to these, Brosse et al. (1999) predicted fish distribution in a mesotrophic lake using hydroacoustic survey and artificial neural networks, indicating the use of hydroacoustic data. Chuang et al. (2012) analyzed weather variation influences on mosquito abundance patterns in Saginaw County, Michigan, suggesting the use of meteorological and entomological data. Lebl et al. (2013) predicted Culex pipiens/restuans population dynamics using interval lagged weather data, implying the use of meteorological data.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for modeling and predicting various phenomena. ANNs typically require large datasets for training, which can be obtained from various sources, including surveys, sensors, and public datasets.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it implies the use of various data sources, such as hydrological, limnological, entomological, epidemiological, meteorological, veterinary, and medical data, likely obtained through methods such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets.
