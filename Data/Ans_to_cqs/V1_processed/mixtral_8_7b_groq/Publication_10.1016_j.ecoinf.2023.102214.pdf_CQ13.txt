The provided context does not give specific details about the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. However, it does mention that models were trained and tested by tuning the number of required epochs. This implies that the number of epochs was a hyperparameter that was adjusted during the training process.

In addition, the context states that the efficacy of the techniques was assessed by computing the top-k accuracy on a test set. This suggests that other hyperparameters, such as the batch size or the number of layers in the model, may have also been tuned to optimize performance.

Furthermore, the context mentions that the deep learning methods used in this study were partially funded by a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and that a Microsoft Sponsorship supported Azure-based development and model deployment in Whiskerbook.org. This information indicates that the researchers used cloud-based resources for development and deployment, which may have included tools or platforms for hyperparameter tuning.

Overall, while the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not provided in the context, it is clear that the number of epochs was tuned and other hyperparameters may have also been adjusted to optimize performance. Additionally, the use of cloud-based resources suggests that the researchers had access to tools or platforms for hyperparameter tuning.
