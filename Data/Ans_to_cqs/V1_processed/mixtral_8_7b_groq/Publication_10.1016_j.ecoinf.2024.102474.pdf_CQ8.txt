The provided context does not give information about the specific location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The models were implemented using the PyTorch Lightning framework, which is built on top of PyTorch, and the hyperparameters were tuned using an Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization procedure. However, the study does not mention where the code for this implementation is stored or if it is publicly available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
