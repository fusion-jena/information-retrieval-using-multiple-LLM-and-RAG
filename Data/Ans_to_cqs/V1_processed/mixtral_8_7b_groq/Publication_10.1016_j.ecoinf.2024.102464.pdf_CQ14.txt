The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as whether a grid search, random search, or some other method was used. However, it does mention that the parameters were refined through "several hundred independent simulations" and logistic regression analysis. 

In the context of model building, simulations are often used to test different combinations of parameter values and evaluate the performance of the model. By running "several hundred independent simulations," the researchers were able to explore a wide range of possible parameter values and identify the combination that produced the best results.

The logistic regression analysis mentioned in the text was likely used to derive the parameters x, u, and y for the leopard cat regression analysis model. Logistic regression is a statistical method that is often used to model the relationship between a binary response variable (in this case, the presence or absence of the leopard cat) and one or more predictor variables. By conducting this analysis on 288 grids, the researchers were able to identify the parameter values that produced the best fit for the data.

Overall, while the text does not provide specific details about the method used to optimize the hyperparameters, it is clear that the researchers used a combination of simulations and statistical analysis to refine the parameters and improve the performance of the model.
