The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the authors used a deep learning technique for fish biomass estimation. It is common practice to use powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which is essential for handling the large number of computations involved in deep learning. Therefore, it is likely that GPUs were used for training the deep learning model in this study, but this is not explicitly stated in the context.
