The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves minimizing the loss on the validation dataset to perform objective function evaluations. The models were trained for a maximum of 10 epochs using the stochastic gradient descent with a momentum (‘sgdm’) optimizer. This means that the model's performance was evaluated at the end of each epoch on the validation dataset, and the optimization process adjusted the model's parameters to minimize the loss.

Additionally, the implementation of models and ensemble learning methods was performed using the MATLAB R2021a, and the individual models were trained using the six pre-trained networks for each dataset. The weights for the first 10 layers for each pre-trained network were frozen, and the optimization of hyperparameters was performed using the Bayesian optimization. This approach allowed for a more efficient and effective optimization of the model's performance during training.

Furthermore, the classification accuracies for validation and testing data for UBD_45 and VP_200 datasets are presented in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5, respectively. These figures provide a visual representation of the model's performance during training and can be used to monitor the model's progress and identify any potential issues.

The other performance metrics including sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-measure for all models for UBD_45 and VP_200 datasets are shown in Table I and Table II, respectively. These metrics provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance during training and can be used to identify any strengths or weaknesses in the model's ability to classify the data.

Overall, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves a combination of minimizing the loss on the validation dataset, using pre-trained networks and Bayesian optimization, and evaluating the model's performance using various metrics. This approach allows for a thorough and effective monitoring of the model's performance during training.
