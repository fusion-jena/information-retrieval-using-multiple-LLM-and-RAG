The provided context does not contain information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. The text mainly discusses the use of Random Forest, a machine learning technique, to evaluate the presence-absence and family classification of seagrass meadows in the Mediterranean Sea.

However, in machine learning, including deep learning, randomness can be handled through various strategies, such as:

1. Initializing weights with random values: Neural networks are initialized with random weights to break symmetry and ensure that different neurons learn different features during training.
2. Shuffling training data: Shuffling the training dataset before each epoch helps to avoid overfitting and ensures that the model learns from different patterns in the data.
3. Using a random seed value: A random seed value is used to ensure reproducibility in the training process. By setting a specific seed value, the same initial random weights and shuffled training data will be used in every run, allowing for consistent results.
4. Regularization techniques: Techniques like dropout, L1/L2 regularization, and early stopping are used to prevent overfitting and improve generalization by adding a level of randomness during training.

In the context provided, the Random Forest algorithm uses bootstrap aggregating (bagging) to handle randomness. This involves creating multiple subsets of the original dataset with replacement, fitting a decision tree to each subset, and aggregating the results to produce the final prediction. This process reduces overfitting and increases the robustness of the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, general strategies for machine learning include initializing weights with random values, shuffling training data, using a random seed value, and regularization techniques. The Random Forest algorithm specifically uses bootstrap aggregating to handle randomness.
