The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. There is no mention of GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository hosting platforms in the given text. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link or location for the code repository.

For researchers or developers interested in the deep learning pipeline used in this study, it is recommended to contact the authors directly. The contact information for the authors, Lino Comesa˜na-Cebral, Joaquín Martínez-S´anchez, Gabriel Su´arez-Fern´andez, and Pedro Arias, is provided in the context, and they can be reached through their affiliated institution, CINTECX, Universidade de Vigo, Applied Geotechnology Group.

Alternatively, the authors may have submitted their code to the journal's supplementary materials or made it available through a data sharing platform, which is not specified in the context. In this case, searching for the paper's title, "Wildfire response of forest species from multispectral LiDAR data. A deep learning approach with synthetic data," or the authors' names in combination with keywords like "code," "repository," or "deep learning pipeline" might help locate the code.
