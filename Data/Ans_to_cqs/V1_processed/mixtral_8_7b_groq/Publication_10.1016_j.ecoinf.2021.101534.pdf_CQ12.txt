The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is inferred from the context that mentions the use of a CNN-based classifier for wildlife sound identification, and the description of the model architecture in terms of convolutional layers, filters, and pooling operations. Additionally, the input to the model is described as spectrogram images, which are commonly used as input for CNN-based models in image recognition tasks. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in this pipeline is a CNN.
