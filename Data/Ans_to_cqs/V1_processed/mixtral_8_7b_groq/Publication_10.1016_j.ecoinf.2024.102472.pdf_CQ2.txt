The provided pieces of context do not specifically mention the use of deep learning techniques. However, they do discuss the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks in image classification and biomass prediction. The input data formats used in these studies are primarily related to remote sensing imagery.

In the study by De Lucia et al. (2022), hyperspectral image data is used for explainable AI in edge computing environments. Hyperspectral imaging provides detailed information about the spectral characteristics of objects in an image, and it is commonly used in remote sensing applications.

Domingues et al. (2020) used integrated multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for high-performance prediction of eucalyptus biomass. Multispectral data consists of multiple bands of optical imagery, while SAR data is acquired using radar technology and can provide information about the physical properties of objects, such as their dielectric constant.

Dube and Mutanga (2015) used Landsat 8 multispectral data for quantifying aboveground biomass in South Africa. Landsat is a widely used satellite system for remote sensing applications, and Landsat 8 provides multispectral data in 11 bands.

Mngadi et al. (2021a) used Sentinel-2 spectral data for quantifying above-ground carbon stock in an urban reforested landscape. Sentinel-2 is a European Space Agency (ESA) Earth observation mission that provides high-resolution multispectral data.

Mngadi et al. (2021b) examined the effectiveness of Sentinel-1 and 2 imagery for commercial forest species mapping. Sentinel-1 provides SAR data, while Sentinel-2 provides multispectral data.

Therefore, the primary data formats used in the studies mentioned are remote sensing imagery, specifically multispectral and SAR data. While these studies do not explicitly mention deep learning techniques, it is worth noting that deep learning has been increasingly applied to remote sensing image analysis in recent years. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a type of deep learning model, have been used for image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks in remote sensing applications. In such cases, the input data format would still be remote sensing imagery.
