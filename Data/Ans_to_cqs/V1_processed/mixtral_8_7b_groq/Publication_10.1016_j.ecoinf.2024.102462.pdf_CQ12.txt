The specific type of deep learning model used in the described pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), more specifically, the ResNet architecture. This information can be inferred from the context as it mentions the use of residual connections, which is a key innovation of the ResNet (Residual Network) model introduced in 2015 by He et al. The ResNet model became a breakthrough in the field of convolutional neural networks, winning the ILSVRC challenge that year. The use of residual connections allowed for the arbitrary limit of stacked consecutive blocks to be lifted, enabling researchers to have an effectively infinite number of parameters and depth. This innovation has become a staple in deep learning and is still used in modern architectures. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model utilized in the described pipeline is a CNN, specifically the ResNet architecture.
