The provided context does not include a direct link to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that "Data and code are available as supplementary material to the article." This suggests that the code for the deep learning pipeline could be available as supplementary material along with the article.

To access the supplementary material, one would need to locate the article and look for a section or link labeled "Supplementary Material" or "Online Supplementary Material." This section typically contains additional figures, tables, and data that support the findings of the article. It is possible that the code for the deep learning pipeline is included in this supplementary material.

The article can be found at the following link: <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-0912-1>. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a direct link to the code repository.

Therefore, the answer to the query is: The code repository link for the deep learning pipeline is not directly provided in the given context, but the code may be available as supplementary material along with the article at <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-0912-1>.
