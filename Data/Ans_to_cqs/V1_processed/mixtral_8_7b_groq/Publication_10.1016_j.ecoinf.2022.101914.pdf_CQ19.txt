The provided context does not mention any deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text focuses on the procedure for building models using the biomod2 package in R, which includes regression-based models (Generalized Linear Models, Generalized Additive Models, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines) and machine learning models (Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks, and Maximum Entropy software). It appears that the models are built using the biomod2 package in R, without specifying any deep learning frameworks.
