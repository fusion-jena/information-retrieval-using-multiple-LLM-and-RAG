The provided context does not include information about the performance metrics used to evaluate a deep learning model. The context discusses Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products, their suitability for research needs, and the evaluation of NDVI data from different sources.

However, in general, when evaluating the performance of a deep learning model, several metrics can be used, including:

1. Accuracy: It is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. It gives an overall idea of the model's performance.
2. Precision: It is the ratio of true positive predictions (relevant samples that are correctly identified) to the total number of positive predictions. It measures the exactness of the model.
3. Recall: It is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of relevant samples. It measures the completeness of the model.
4. F1-score: It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which gives a balanced view of both measures.
5. Confusion matrix: It is a table that summarizes the predictions made by the model, including true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
6. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve: It is a plot of the true positive rate against the false positive rate, which helps to evaluate the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.

These metrics can provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance and help to identify areas for improvement.
