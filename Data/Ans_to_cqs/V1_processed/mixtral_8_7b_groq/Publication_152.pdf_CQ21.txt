Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the post-processing steps taken after training the model. However, it does mention the calculation of the F1 score and Jaccard index as part of the results measurement. It is likely that these metrics were calculated to evaluate the performance of the model.

In the context of image classification tasks, other common post-processing steps include:

1. Generating saliency maps: These are visualizations that highlight the parts of the input image that the model found most important for its prediction. Saliency maps can be useful for understanding how the model is making its decisions and for identifying any potential biases.
2. Creating confusion matrices: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by comparing its predicted labels to the true labels. It shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, which can be used to calculate various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
3. Visualizing model predictions: This involves applying the trained model to new, unseen images and visualizing the predicted labels. This can help to evaluate the model's performance on a qualitative level and to identify any potential issues or limitations.

Given that the context discusses the use of the U-net architecture for image segmentation, it is possible that additional post-processing steps were taken to refine the segmentation masks produced by the model. These might include morphological operations such as erosion and dilation, connected component analysis, or conditional random fields. However, without further information, it is not possible to say for certain what post-processing steps were taken.
