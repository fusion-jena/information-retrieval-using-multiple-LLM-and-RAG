The deep learning model in question is used for the purpose of image classification, specifically for empty camera trap image recognition. This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of the ResNext-101 model for experiments, a model that is widely used for empty camera trap image recognition. Furthermore, the training process of the model is optimized to minimize loss value, which is a common practice in classification tasks. However, the specific classes or categories that the model is trained to distinguish between are not specified in the context.

Moreover, the data splitting strategy used in the study also supports the classification purpose of the model. The data is split in a way that keeps the integrity of events, i.e., putting all images of an event into the same dataset. This is done to prevent poor generalization of the DCNN model, which is a common issue in classification tasks where similar data points can lead to overfitting.

In addition, the selection of update layers for the model further indicates its use for classification. The recommendation is to selectively update the last few layers of the DCNN model, which is a common practice in transfer learning for classification tasks. This approach allows the model to learn high-level features that are specific to the classification task at hand.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the deep learning model is designed for the purpose of image classification, specifically for empty camera trap image recognition.
