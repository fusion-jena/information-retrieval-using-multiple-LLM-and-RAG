Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps applied after model training. However, it does mention that models were developed and tested using various subsets of training data. It also mentions that the models used are Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models.

The context does mention that the models were tested using a separate test set, which is a common postprocessing step to evaluate the performance of the models. The models' performance could have been evaluated using various metrics, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), or R-squared, but the text does not provide information on which metrics were used.

Additionally, the context describes the development of multiple models with and without sensor values, and with and without continuous high-frequency data. These variations could have been used to perform sensitivity analyses or compare the performance of different model configurations, which are common postprocessing steps in machine learning projects.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices, it does mention that the models were tested using a separate test set and that various model configurations were developed and compared. The performance of the models could have been evaluated using various metrics, but the text does not provide information on which metrics were used.
