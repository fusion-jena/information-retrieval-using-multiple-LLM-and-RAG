The text does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the performance of the models was evaluated on both a validation set and a test set, which is a common practice to assess how well a model can generalize to unseen data.

Moreover, the proposed transformer-based neural network, EMViT-Net, was compared with other state-of-the-art models on the validation set and test set of the considered dataset, EMDS-6. The comparison was based on the evaluation of average precision, recall, and F1-score for all categories, which provides a comprehensive view of the model's performance on the unseen data.

Therefore, while the text does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models, the evaluation of the models on both validation and test sets and the comparison of the proposed model with other state-of-the-art models on the unseen data suggest that some efforts were made to assess the models' generalizability.

It is also worth noting that the EMViT-Net model achieved the highest classification accuracy on both the validation set and the test set, indicating that it may have better generalizability than the other considered models. However, without further information about the dataset and the training process, it is difficult to make a definitive conclusion about the generalizability of the models.
