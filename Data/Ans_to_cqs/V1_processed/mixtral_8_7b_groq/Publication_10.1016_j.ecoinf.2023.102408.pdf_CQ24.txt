The provided context discusses the use of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm in a study, but it does not directly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of randomness in the RF algorithm.

RF algorithm uses bagging or boosting algorithms to randomly select predictors, which helps to reduce overfitting and improve the accuracy of the model. In this study, the researchers systematically evaluated the "mtry" parameter, which determines the number of variables randomly selected at each split, to strike a balance between stability and minimizing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

As for deep learning pipelines, there are several strategies employed to handle randomness. One common approach is to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. A random seed value is a starting point for the random number generator algorithm, which is used in various parts of the deep learning pipeline, such as weight initialization, data shuffling, and dropout regularization. By setting a fixed random seed value, researchers can ensure that the same set of random numbers is generated every time the pipeline is run, which helps to reproduce the results.

Another strategy to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines is to use techniques such as cross-validation and ensemble methods. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on one fold, and testing it on another fold. This process is repeated for each fold, and the results are averaged to obtain a more robust estimate of the model's performance. Ensemble methods, such as bagging and boosting, involve training multiple models on different subsets of the data and combining their predictions to improve the accuracy and reduce overfitting.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines, it does discuss the use of randomness in the RF algorithm. In deep learning pipelines, common strategies to handle randomness include setting a random seed value, using cross-validation, and employing ensemble methods.
