Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text focuses mainly on the parameters and performance evaluation of the model, without mentioning any details about the computational hardware used for training.

However, it is common practice to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for deep learning training due to their ability to perform parallel computations efficiently. Given that this study involves deep learning models, it is highly likely that GPUs or TPUs were used for training, but this information is not available in the provided context.
