The deep learning model in this study is built using the TensorFlow (version 1.12.0) framework. This information can be inferred from the statement that mentions the development environment is built using Python (version 3.6.2) packaged by Conda-forge, and the tool packages used in the virtual environment are TensorFlow (version 1.12.0) and Numpy (version 1.19.2). There is no mention of any other deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, Keras, or Caffe, so it can be concluded that only TensorFlow was used to build the deep learning model.
