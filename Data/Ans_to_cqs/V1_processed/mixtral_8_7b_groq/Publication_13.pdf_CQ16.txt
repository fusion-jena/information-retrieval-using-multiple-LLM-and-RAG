Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the training process involves an adversarial training procedure, where the model parameters in the shared part of the network are optimized to minimize the loss of the label classifier and maximize the loss of the domain classifier simultaneously. This suggests that the training process might involve monitoring the performance of both the label classifier and the domain classifier to assess the model's ability to generalize across datasets.

Additionally, the context mentions that loss and accuracy development during training are reported in Figures S2 and S3. Therefore, it is possible that the training process involves tracking the loss or accuracy over time and using that information to determine when training is complete. For instance, the training process might be configured to stop when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing, or when the validation accuracy reaches a certain threshold.

However, it is important to note that the provided context does not give specific details about the training procedure or the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query without additional information.
