Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the use of terms such as "CNN model" and "convolutional" in the context. The authors use this model for between-dataset prediction, where the CNN model is trained with a source dataset to predict images from a different target dataset. Additionally, the CNN model is also used for within-dataset classification, where the model is trained with a subset of images from the same dataset and then used to predict the class (family label) of another subset of images from the same dataset. Therefore, it can be concluded that a CNN model is the type of deep learning model used in this pipeline.
