The provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It gives a detailed explanation of the proposed work for the classification of environmental microorganisms using a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) modules. The model, named EMViT-Net, is tested on a publicly available dataset of environmental microorganisms, EMDS-6, and the results are compared with other deep learning models. The operating system, processor, RAM, programming language, development environment, input dataset, input dimensions, batch size, loss, activation function, learning rate, epochs, and optimizer used for the testing are also mentioned. However, there is no information about the code repository link for this deep learning pipeline.
