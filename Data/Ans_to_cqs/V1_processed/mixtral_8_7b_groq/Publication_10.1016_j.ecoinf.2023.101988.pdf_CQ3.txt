The provided context does not contain specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the study of unmanned aircraft systems in wildlife research. However, it does mention the use of acoustic monitoring and birdsong identification software such as Bird Song Id Australia and Raven Lite.

In the context of deep learning for computer vision tasks, common data annotation techniques include:

1. Image-level annotation: In this technique, an image is annotated with a single label indicating the presence or absence of a particular object class. This is the simplest form of annotation and is useful for tasks such as image classification.
2. Bounding box annotation: In this technique, a bounding box is drawn around each instance of an object class in an image. This is useful for tasks such as object detection, where the goal is to locate and identify objects within an image.
3. Semantic segmentation: In this technique, each pixel in an image is assigned a label indicating the object class to which it belongs. This is useful for tasks such as image segmentation, where the goal is to partition an image into regions corresponding to different object classes.
4. Instance segmentation: In this technique, each instance of an object class in an image is segmented and assigned a unique label. This is useful for tasks such as instance-level object detection and tracking.

It is possible that one or more of these techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline for the study of unmanned aircraft systems in wildlife research, but the provided context does not contain enough information to confirm this.

In summary, the provided context does not contain specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the study of unmanned aircraft systems in wildlife research. However, it does mention the use of acoustic monitoring and birdsong identification software. Common data annotation techniques for computer vision tasks include image-level annotation, bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation.
