Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text describes the methods used to create a pipeline for building supervised classification models for different tuna species, but it does not mention where the code for this pipeline is hosted. It is possible that the code is not publicly available or that it was not specified in the text. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific repository location for the deep learning pipeline.
