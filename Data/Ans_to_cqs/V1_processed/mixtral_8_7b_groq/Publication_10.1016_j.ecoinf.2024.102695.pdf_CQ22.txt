The specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) levels in the Shandong peninsula are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model provides an "overall performance evaluation" that considers the correlation, variability, and bias of the tested model.

The correlation refers to the strength and direction of the relationship between the predicted and actual DO values. A high positive correlation indicates that the model's predictions are closely aligned with the actual DO values, while a low or negative correlation indicates poor performance.

Variability refers to the spread or dispersion of the predicted DO values around the actual DO values. A low variability indicates that the model's predictions are consistently close to the actual DO values, while a high variability indicates that the predictions are spread out and less accurate.

Bias refers to the systematic error or deviation of the predicted DO values from the actual DO values. A low bias indicates that the model's predictions are unbiased and accurate, while a high bias indicates that the predictions are consistently higher or lower than the actual DO values.

Additionally, the early stopping strategy is used to prevent overfitting issues, which suggests that the model's performance is also evaluated based on its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Therefore, while the specific metrics of accuracy, precision, and recall are not mentioned, the context implies that the model's performance is evaluated based on its correlation, variability, bias, and generalizability.
