The strategy to monitor model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated using overall accuracy (OA) and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metrics. The learning rate is gradually decayed as the training progresses, and the model's performance is assessed by adjusting three parameters: voxel size, regularization strength, and batch size. The voxel size is the voxelization subsampling size, the regularization strength influences the coarseness of the minimal partition, and batch size means the batch number of point cloud samples in training. The hold-out method is used to distinguish the test set and the training set at a ratio of 3:7 for preprocessing the original data. The parameters of networks are further adjusted to explore the influence of parameters on experimental results.

Moreover, the context suggests that the training batch size was adjusted to observe its impact on segmentation accuracy. It was found that, within a reasonable range limited by GPU memory, a larger training batch size of 8 could better preserve the original features of the point clouds and result in a sharper minimum, leading to improved results.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention a strategy for monitoring model performance during training, it can be inferred that the performance is evaluated using OA and mIoU metrics, and adjustments are made to the learning rate, voxel size, regularization strength, and batch size to optimize model performance.
