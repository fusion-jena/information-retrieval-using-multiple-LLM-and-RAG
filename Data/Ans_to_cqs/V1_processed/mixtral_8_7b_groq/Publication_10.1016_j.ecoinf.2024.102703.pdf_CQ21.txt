Based on the provided context, there are specific postprocessing steps mentioned after the model training. However, the query asks for common steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, and Confusion matrix. I will answer the query by first explaining the mentioned postprocessing steps and then discussing the common steps.

Mentioned postprocessing steps:

1. Coefficient of determination (R²) calculation: R² is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. In this case, R² is calculated between the measured and predicted TSI values.
2. Root-mean-square error (RMSE) calculation: RMSE is a standard way to quantify the error of a model. It measures the differences between values predicted by a model and the values actually observed.

Common postprocessing steps not mentioned in the context:

1. Saliency maps: Saliency maps are a way to visualize the importance of input features concerning the predicted output. They highlight the regions of the input that have the most influence on the output. In the context of this problem, saliency maps could be used to visualize the importance of aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) in predicting TSI.
2. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm in terms of its ability to correctly classify samples into predefined categories. In this case, a confusion matrix would not be applicable since the model is predicting a continuous variable (TSI) rather than categorical variables.

In summary, the provided context mentions postprocessing steps related to the calculation of R² and RMSE. Common postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps and Confusion matrix are not mentioned. Saliency maps could be used to visualize the importance of input features, while a confusion matrix would not be applicable in this case due to the continuous nature of the predicted variable.
