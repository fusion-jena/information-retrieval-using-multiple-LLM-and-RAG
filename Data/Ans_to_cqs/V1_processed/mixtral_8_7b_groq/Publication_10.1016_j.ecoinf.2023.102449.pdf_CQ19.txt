The provided context does not give specific information about the framework used to build the deep learning model. The focus of the text is on the architecture of the model, its components, and their configurations. It describes the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) set up as wide residual networks, with details on the pre-processing, encoding, decoding, and post-processing operations. However, it does not mention any specific deep learning framework such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or others. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this question based on the given context.
