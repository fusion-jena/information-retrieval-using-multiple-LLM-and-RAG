The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is semantic segmentation. Semantic segmentation is a process of labeling each pixel in an image to a specific class, enabling the location and delineation of artificial and natural objects in photos. This is evident in the studies by Aghanaki, T. et al., 2021; Taghanaki, S.A. et al., 2021; and Martinez-Sanchez et al., 2022.

In the study by Martinez-Sanchez et al., 2022, the deep learning model is specifically used for the delineation of the skyline in images. However, the detection of edges or object boundaries in semantic segmentation tends to be blurry, leading to a loss of effective spatial resolution and diminished high-frequency details. To address this, a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) is applied to capture fine details, compensating for the limited performance of these kinds of networks to generate precisely delineated objects.

The effectiveness of the CRF is measured by calculating the length of the signals extracted with and without CRF and evaluating the gain length. This allows for a more detailed skyline, which is crucial for extracting meaningful information for the study.

In summary, the deep learning model is used for semantic segmentation, specifically for the delineation of the skyline in images. The CRF is applied to increase the detail of the skyline, making it possible to extract precise and meaningful information for the study.
