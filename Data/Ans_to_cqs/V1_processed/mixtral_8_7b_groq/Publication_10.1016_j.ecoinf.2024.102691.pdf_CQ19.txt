Based on the provided context, the specific framework used to build the deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned. However, we can make an educated guess that the model was built using PyTorch. Here's why:

The context mentions the use of the YOLOv5 architecture, which is a popular object detection model. YOLOv5 has official implementations in PyTorch, and the research community primarily uses PyTorch for implementing and extending the YOLO architecture. Furthermore, the context mentions the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as an optimizer, which is a standard optimizer in PyTorch.

Although the text does not explicitly state the use of PyTorch, the combination of YOLOv5 and SGD optimizer suggests that PyTorch is the most likely framework used to build the deep learning model. However, it's important to note that this is an educated guess based on the available context, and the actual framework used may be different.
