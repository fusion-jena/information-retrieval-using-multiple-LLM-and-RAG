The provided pieces of context do not contain information about the specific datasets (MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet, etc.) used in deep learning pipelines. However, they do mention the application of deep learning in ecology and environmental studies.

Christin, S., Hervet, ´E., Lecomte, N., 2019, in their paper "Applications for deep learning in ecology" discuss the use of deep learning techniques for various ecological applications, including species distribution modeling, habitat mapping, and phenological forecasting. However, they do not mention specific datasets used in these applications.

Voces, R., Diaz-Balteiro, L., Alfranca, W¨aldchen, J., M¨ader, P., 2018, in their paper "Machine learning for image based species identification" discuss the use of machine learning techniques for species identification using images. They mention the use of various image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, but they do not specify the datasets used.

Cejka, T., et al., 2020, in their paper "Predicted climate change will increase the truffle cultivation potential in Central Europe" use species distribution models to predict the potential cultivation area of truffles under climate change. They mention the use of various environmental and climatic variables, but they do not mention any specific datasets used in their study.

Chang, G.J., 2023, in their paper "Biodiversity estimation by environment drivers using machine/deep learning for ecological management" discuss the use of machine learning and deep learning for biodiversity estimation. They mention the use of various environmental and species occurrence data, but they do not specify any specific datasets used.

In conclusion, while the provided context discusses the use of deep learning in ecology and environmental studies, it does not contain information about the specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines.
