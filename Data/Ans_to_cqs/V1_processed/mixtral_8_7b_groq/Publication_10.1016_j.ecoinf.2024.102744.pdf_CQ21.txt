After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be involved, such as generating saliency maps, calculating various metrics, and creating a confusion matrix. However, based on the provided context, the specific postprocessing steps are not explicitly mentioned.

From the context, we know that the model is a classification network with several convolution, pooling, dropout, and dense layers. The network is designed to classify images, particularly for counting pollen-bearing bees. The training process includes the use of techniques like focal loss and an Overlap Sampler to improve the model's performance.

The context also provides a table (Table 6) comparing the number of parameters, GFLOPs, and inference time of various models, including the proposed methods. This table is a result of the post-training evaluation.

However, there is no information about generating saliency maps, which are often used to visualize the regions of the input that the model focuses on for making predictions. Similarly, there is no mention of calculating metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score, which are commonly used for evaluating classification models. A confusion matrix, another evaluation tool, is also not mentioned in the provided context.

In conclusion, while the context provides details about the model architecture, training techniques, and a comparison of various models' performance, it does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps like generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix.
