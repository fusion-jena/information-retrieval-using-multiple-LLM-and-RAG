Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The study conducted by Kikuchi et al. (2022) focused on analyzing wild bird species' richness in online shared videos on the YouTube platform. The study used the keyword "Yacho" (wild birds) to extract videos that had been viewed more than 100 times as of June 15, 2022. However, the context does not mention any data repository related to the deep learning pipeline used in the study.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it is not mentioned in the provided context. It is possible that the data repository is not publicly available or was not mentioned in the study's publication. If you have access to the study's methodology or additional information, you may be able to find the answer to the query. Otherwise, it may be necessary to contact the study's authors directly to inquire about the data repository.
