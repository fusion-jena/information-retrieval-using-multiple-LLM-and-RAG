The text provided does not give explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the images were labeled as "dam" or "not dam" for the training of the classifier. This is a form of image-level annotation, where each image is assigned a single label, in this case indicating the presence or absence of a dam in the image.

Instance segmentation, which involves labeling each individual instance of an object in an image, is not mentioned in the text. Similarly, bounding box annotation, which involves drawing a box around each object in an image, is also not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it appears that the data annotation technique used in this deep learning pipeline is image-level annotation, where each image is labeled as "dam" or "not dam".
