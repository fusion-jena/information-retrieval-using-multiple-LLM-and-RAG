Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the description of a deep learning model for daily streamflow forecasting, which includes the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRU), Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Networks (BiRNN), and other machine learning methods like KELM and RVFL.

The model's architecture consists of CNN layers with a specified number of filters and kernel size, followed by BiGRU or BiRNN layers with a defined number of neurons. The optimizer, activation function, number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate are also provided for the training process. However, there is no reference to data augmentation techniques, which are commonly used to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's performance, especially when dealing with small datasets.

In summary, based on the given context, data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are not explicitly applied in the described deep learning pipeline.
