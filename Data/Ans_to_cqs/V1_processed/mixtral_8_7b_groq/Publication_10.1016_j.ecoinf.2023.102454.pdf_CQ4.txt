I don't have the specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for the study you're referring to, as the context provided does not include details about the deep learning methods used. However, I can tell you that common data augmentation techniques in deep learning include flipping, rotation, and scaling.

Data augmentation is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the diversity of data available for training models, without actually collecting new data. This is particularly important in the field of computer vision, where data scarcity and class imbalance can significantly impact model performance.

Flipping is a simple data augmentation technique where the image is horizontally or vertically flipped. This helps the model to generalize better, as it can learn features that are invariant to the direction of the object in the image.

Rotation involves rotating the image by a certain angle. This helps the model to learn features that are invariant to the orientation of the object in the image.

Scaling changes the size of the image. This can help the model to learn features that are invariant to the size of the object in the image.

These techniques can be applied in isolation or in combination, and can greatly increase the robustness and performance of deep learning models. However, the specific techniques and parameters used would depend on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the model.
