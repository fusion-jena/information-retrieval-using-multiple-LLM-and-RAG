The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics: Mean Scaled Absolute Error (MSAE), Intersection over Union (IoU) for plants, and DCA-Procrustes-Correlation (DPC).

The Mean Scaled Absolute Error (MSAE) is a measure of the difference between the predicted and actual values. It is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values, scaled by the range of the actual values. A lower MSAE indicates better performance.

The Intersection over Union (IoU) for plants is a measure of the overlap between the predicted and actual plant cover. It is calculated as the area of overlap between the predicted and actual plant cover, divided by the area of union of the predicted and actual plant cover. A higher IoU indicates better performance.

The DCA-Procrustes-Correlation (DPC) is a measure of the similarity between the predicted and actual plant species distribution. It is calculated as the correlation between the predicted and actual plant species distribution, after aligning them using Procrustes analysis. A higher DPC indicates better performance.

These metrics are used to compare the different model setups and configurations. The results are averaged over three repetitions to ensure the consistency and reliability of the evaluation.
