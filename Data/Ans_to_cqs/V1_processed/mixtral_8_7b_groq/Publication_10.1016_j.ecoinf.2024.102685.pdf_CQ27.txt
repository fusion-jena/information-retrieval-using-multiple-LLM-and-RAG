Based on the provided context, there is no information about deploying a trained deep learning model. The text mainly discusses the use of random forest classification for statistical analysis of seagrass species in a lagoon. It includes details about data acquisition, preparation, and validation but does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model.

The process described in the context involves collecting field data, preprocessing the data, and then using it to train and validate random forest classification models. The satellite data and image preprocessing are also discussed, but these are separate from the model training and validation process.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query since the necessary information is not provided in the given context.
