Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. There are references to various studies and datasets, but none of them mention the specific cloud platform used for deployment.

One of the sources, "Crego, R.D., Stabach, J.A., Connette, G., 2022. Implementation of species distribution models in Google earth engine," discusses the implementation of species distribution models in Google Earth Engine. However, it does not specify if a deep learning model was deployed or which cloud platform was used.

Another source, "DiMiceli, C., Sohlberg, R., Townshend, J., 2022. MODIS/Terra Vegetation Continuous Fields Yearly L3 Global 250m SIN Grid V061 [Dataset]," provides a dataset used for land cover studies, but it does not mention anything about deep learning model deployment.

The remaining sources are research papers and a book chapter that discuss various methods and techniques for species distribution modeling, model evaluation, and sampling bias correction. However, they do not provide information on the cloud platform used for deep learning model deployment.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
