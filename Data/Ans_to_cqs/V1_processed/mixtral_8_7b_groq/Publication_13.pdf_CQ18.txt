During the training of the models, the performance was monitored using loss and accuracy development, which is reported in Figures S2 and S3. These figures provide insights into how well the model is learning and fitting the data as the training progresses.

Additionally, an adversarial training procedure was implemented, which aims to optimize shared intermediate features to be invariant between two domains. This means that the model is trained to classify datasets instead of taxa, making the dataset classification task harder when the feature distributions between two datasets are more different. A large classification error in this context indicates that the model can generalize across all specimens regardless of their body size, implying that the model is learning robust features for classification.

Furthermore, the model's performance was evaluated using a within-dataset analysis with 400 training images in the LH random sampling. This analysis showed that large taxonomic groups were correctly classified in most cases, indicating that the model performs well when the input subclass (species and genera within a family) is present in the training data.

In summary, the strategy to monitor the model performance during training involves tracking loss and accuracy, implementing adversarial training for robust feature learning, and evaluating the model's performance on a within-dataset analysis.
