Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the mentioned studies. The references [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] discuss various deep learning methods and architectures for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, but they do not mention where the data or code for their pipelines are available.

In general, researchers may use various platforms to share their data and code, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, GitHub, or the study's own website. However, without specific information, it is not possible to determine where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in these studies is available.

Therefore, I would recommend contacting the authors of the studies directly to inquire about the data repository. They should be able to provide more information about where the data and code for their deep learning pipelines are available.
