Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the deep learning models used in the study. However, it is mentioned that the networks' performance is evaluated using several metrics, such as accuracy (Acc), specificity (Spe), sensitivity (Sen), and mean average precision (mAP), among others. These metrics are calculated based on the top 100 matches retrieved for each query image.

In general, deep learning models can be trained using different strategies, such as early stopping or monitoring validation loss. Early stopping consists of halting the training process before the model starts overfitting the training data. This can be done by tracking the performance of the model on a validation set during training and stopping the training when the performance on the validation set starts degrading or plateaus. Monitoring validation loss involves stopping the training when the validation loss reaches a minimum or plateaus, indicating that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data.

Therefore, while the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the models used in the study are not provided, it can be inferred that some form of validation-based stopping criterion was likely employed. However, further information would be needed to confirm this.
