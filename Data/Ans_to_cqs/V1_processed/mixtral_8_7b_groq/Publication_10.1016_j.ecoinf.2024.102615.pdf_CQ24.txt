The text provided discusses a deep learning pipeline that includes data partitioning and the training of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. While it does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the pipeline, it does describe other strategies that are used to ensure the reproducibility and reliability of the model's performance.

In the data partitioning stage, the raw dataset is randomly shuffled and then divided into training, validation, and test sets. To reduce the influence of random splitting, this partitioning process is repeated ten times, and the data partitioning ratio between the training, validation, and test sets is set as 8:1:1. This strategy helps to ensure that the model's performance is not overly dependent on the specific random split of the data.

In the MLP model training stage, the text describes a process of hyperparameter tuning, where the number of neural network layers, the number of neurons per layer, dropout, learning rate, and batch size are all varied within specified ranges. By systematically exploring these hyperparameters, the authors are able to identify an optimal MLP architecture and parameter configuration that yields an R value of 0.76. This strategy of hyperparameter tuning helps to ensure that the model's performance is not overly dependent on the specific initial configuration of the hyperparameters.

Additionally, the text describes the use of several techniques to mitigate overfitting and accelerate learning in the MLP model. These techniques include batch normalization, dropout, the Adam optimizer, the ReLu activation function, and early stopping. By using these techniques, the authors are able to improve the generalizability and reliability of the model's performance.

Overall, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does describe other strategies that are used to ensure the reproducibility and reliability of the model's performance. These strategies include repeated data partitioning, hyperparameter tuning, and the use of techniques to mitigate overfitting and accelerate learning.
