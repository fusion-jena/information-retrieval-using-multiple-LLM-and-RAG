The criteria used to determine when training is complete for the alate detection models on sorghum leaves is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the optimal hyperparameters for training were determined to be 400 epochs with a batch size of 8, which were constant for all five detection models compared at input resolutions of 640 × 640 and 1280 × 1280 pixels.

In general, training of deep learning models is often determined to be complete when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly, or when the model begins to overfit to the training data. Monitoring the validation loss during training can help determine when to stop training to prevent overfitting and ensure good generalization performance.

In the context of the alate detection models, it is possible that the training was determined to be complete based on a combination of factors, including the performance on the validation set, the computational resources available, and the time required for training. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
