The criteria used to determine when the training of the model is complete is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the training process might be complete when the loss reaches a plateau or when the model starts to overfit the training data.

In the given context, it is mentioned that the loss showed a rapid decline around 1000 iterations and then plateaued. This suggests that the training process could be complete around this point. Moreover, it is stated that when the number of epochs exceeds 200, the network seems to be overfitted to the training data. This implies that the training process might also be complete when the model starts to overfit.

Additionally, the training process might also be evaluated based on the performance of the model on a validation set. However, this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, based on the given context, the criteria used to determine when the training is complete could be a combination of the loss plateauing, the model starting to overfit, and the performance of the model on a validation set.
