The text does not provide explicit information on how the data was split for training, testing, or validation of the deep learning models. However, it does mention that for the between-dataset prediction, the CNN model was trained with a source dataset to predict images from a different target dataset. This suggests that the data was split based on the source and target datasets, with one used for training and the other for testing or validation. Additionally, the text mentions that the CNN model was trained with N images randomly selected from the source dataset, which could imply a form of random sampling or splitting for model training. For within-dataset classification, the model was trained and tested using the same dataset, but with a subset of images used for training and the remaining used for testing or validation. Further details on the exact data splitting criteria are not provided in the text.
