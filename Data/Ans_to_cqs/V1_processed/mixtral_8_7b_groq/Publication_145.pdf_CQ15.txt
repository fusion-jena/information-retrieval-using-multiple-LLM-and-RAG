The deep learning pipeline in the context provided uses the optimizer RMSprop, which is an adaptive learning rate method proposed by Geoff Hinton. RMSprop is not explicitly stated to be a type of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), but it is similar in the sense that it is an optimization technique used to train neural networks. RMSprop adjusts the learning rate based on the moving average of the gradients, allowing for faster convergence and better performance in some cases compared to traditional SGD. The Adam optimizer, which is another type of optimization method that combines the ideas of momentum and adaptive learning rates, is not mentioned in the provided context. The initial learning rate for RMSprop is set to 0.0001, and the network is trained for 300 epochs with 24 images per batch.
