Based on the provided context, there are two techniques mentioned that can be used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline:

1. Purity screening: This technique is used to ensure that adjacent pixels of the same land cover type have similar surface reflectance or Leaf Area Index (LAI) and have enough MODIS pixels. Purity screening is performed using a MODIS pixel where the same land-use type accounts for >90% of the area and the coefficient of variation (CV) of reflectance is <0.3. The CV is the ratio of the average reflectance of the near-infrared (NIR) band to the standard deviation of all sub-pixels included in the MODIS pixel. This technique helps to ensure that the training samples are representative of the actual land cover types and reduces the uncertainty in the selected training samples.
2. Mixed pixel linear decomposition: This technique is based on the assumption of linear modeling of hybrid pixel decomposition. LAI and reflectance in MODIS hybrid pixels can be expressed as a linear combination of the LAI and reflectance of the different land cover types present in the pixel. This technique can help to account for the mixed pixel problem, where a single pixel contains multiple land cover types, and can help to reduce the uncertainty in the selected training samples.

While these techniques do not directly correspond to the examples given in the query (stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection), they do address data bias by ensuring that the training samples are representative of the actual land cover types and accounting for mixed pixels.

In addition, the context suggests that adding measurement data in future studies can further reduce the uncertainty in the selected training samples and improve the suitability of the model for complex terrain areas in high spatial resolution LAI estimation. This could be seen as a form of diverse data collection, as it involves collecting data from multiple sources or perspectives. However, the context does not provide specific details on how this would be implemented.
