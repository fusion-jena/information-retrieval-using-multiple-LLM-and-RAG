Deep learning pipelines utilize a variety of optimization techniques to effectively train deep neural networks (DNNs). Two popular optimization techniques mentioned in the context are Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function in DNNs. It is an extension of the standard gradient descent method, which updates connection weights in the direction of the negative gradient of the error function. SGD improves efficiency by approximating the gradient using a single training example at a time, rather than the entire training dataset. This makes SGD more suitable for large datasets and allows for faster convergence.

Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is another optimization technique used in deep learning. Adam combines ideas from both SGD and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) algorithms. It calculates individual adaptive learning rates for each parameter in the DNN, based on the estimates of the first and second moments of the gradient. This adaptive learning rate allows Adam to effectively handle sparse gradients and non-stationary objectives, resulting in faster training and better convergence compared to SGD.

In summary, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam are two optimization techniques commonly applied in deep learning pipelines. SGD offers efficiency by approximating gradients using single training examples, while Adam provides adaptive learning rates for faster training and better convergence. These optimization techniques help improve the performance of DNNs in various applications, including ecological prediction and forest disturbance analysis.
