Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the comparison between a workflow for importing and applying color palettes to images, and a function that automates this process with color blind friendly ramp palettes. It mentions specific color ramp palettes used for different types of color blindness, but it does not provide information about training criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query with the information given.
