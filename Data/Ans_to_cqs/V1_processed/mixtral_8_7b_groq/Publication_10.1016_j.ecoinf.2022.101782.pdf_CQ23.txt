The text does not provide explicit information about measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, there are some implicit indications that certain steps were taken to enhance the model's ability to generalize.

Firstly, data augmentation was applied to the training set, which involves horizontal flips, random zooms, and counterclockwise shears. This technique helps increase the size and diversity of the training set, reducing overfitting and improving the model's ability to handle new, unseen data.

Secondly, the model was trained on a large dataset consisting of 24,675 images for one class and 32,986 images for another class. The large size of the dataset might have contributed to the model's generalizability. However, it is not explicitly mentioned if the dataset is diverse or if it covers various scenarios, objects, and scenarios.

Thirdly, the model was trained using the ADAM optimizer with a learning rate of 10, and the training process lasted for 4 days, indicating that the model was likely trained on a large number of epochs or iterations. This extensive training process might have helped the model to converge to a better minimum, reducing overfitting and improving generalization.

Lastly, the model's performance was evaluated based on an independent test set of 2060 images, which is a common practice to assess the model's ability to generalize to new data. However, it is not explicitly mentioned if this test set is diverse or if it covers various scenarios, objects, and scenarios.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, there are some implicit indications that data augmentation, large dataset size, extensive training process, and evaluation on an independent test set were used to enhance the model's ability to generalize. However, without more information, it is difficult to definitively say if the model is generalizable.
