Based on the provided context, the data repository for the NGEE Tropics project is called the NGEE Tropics Archive. However, the context does not explicitly mention if this repository is affiliated with or equivalent to any of the popular data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.

The NGEE Tropics Archive is a data repository that allows users to upload and access data packages. It has a web portal and is supported by a programmatic REST API built on top of the Django Python web framework. The Archive manages the data package by storing the data package and associated metadata.

For each data file submitted to the NGEE Tropics Archive, data originators report metadata in an MS Excel template, including the Tree ID or other Location ID, time period of the data, and timestamp details. This metadata is used to facilitate search and retrieval of the content, as well as for long-term archiving and tracking provenance.

Therefore, while the NGEE Tropics Archive is the data repository for the NGEE Tropics project, it is not explicitly mentioned as being affiliated with any of the popular data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
