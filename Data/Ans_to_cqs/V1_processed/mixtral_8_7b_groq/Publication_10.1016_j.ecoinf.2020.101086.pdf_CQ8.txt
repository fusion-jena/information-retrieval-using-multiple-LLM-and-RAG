Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the topic of correcting the effect of sampling bias in species distribution modeling, specifically in the case of a low number of presence data. It mentions a study by Wisz et al., 2008, which discusses the effects of sample size on the performance of species distribution models (SDMs), but it does not mention any code repository.

The context also describes a study by Moua et al., 2020, which presents a new method for correcting the effect of sampling bias in SDMs. However, the study does not provide information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in their research.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query regarding the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline.
