The provided context does not include information about where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. The text describes a research study that uses deep learning for environmental acoustic monitoring and mentions that the neural network architecture was designed to be easily retrained for new recording sites. However, it does not give any details about the location of the code repository, such as whether it is on GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or another platform. Therefore, I am unable to answer this question without additional information.
