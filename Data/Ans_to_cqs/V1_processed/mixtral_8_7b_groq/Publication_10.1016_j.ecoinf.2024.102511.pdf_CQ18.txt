The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a high level of confidence for inclusion in the training data, particularly for species with small sample sizes or variable call characteristics. This means that only confident 'ground truth' classifications are considered, ideally determined by agreement from more than one analyst. This approach ensures that the training data is reliable, which is crucial for the success of BANTER as a supervised machine learning tool.

Additionally, it is recommended that all species and events be included in the classification model to better represent the local species diversity and variability found in the area. However, this may not always be possible due to the challenges in confidently determining species identity based on call characteristics alone.

To further monitor the model performance during training, it is important to ensure that the sample sizes are large enough to explain the natural variability in the data. This is because the accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of automated classification routines depend on the quality and quantity of the training data.

Therefore, the strategy for monitoring the model performance during training involves using high-confidence training data, including all relevant species and events, and ensuring that the sample sizes are large enough to capture the natural variability in the data. This approach helps to improve the efficiency, reduce the subjectivity, and decrease the cost of analyzing large datasets while ensuring accurate and reliable classification results.
