The provided context does not contain information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The context focuses on the DIVERSIMAR project and the methodology used to search for specific tweets through the Twitter API. It mentions the use of the twarc2 library to handle the data in JSON format returned by the Twitter API, but it does not provide any details about the deployment of a deep learning model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
