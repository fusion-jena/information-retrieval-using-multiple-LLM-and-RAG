The provided context does not mention the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers in the described pipeline. Instead, it focuses on the use of a Random Forest (RF) model, which is a type of machine learning algorithm based on classification trees.

The RF model is constructed by creating multiple decision trees and combining them according to certain criteria to generate a final model. The randomness of RF comes from the random selection of samples and characteristic variables. This model has several advantages over other black-box machine learning algorithms, such as high tolerance for noisy datasets, low computational overhead, high interpretability, effective prevention of variable collinearity, avoidance of model overfitting, and good prediction ability for high-dimensional datasets.

The RF model's parameters, such as the number of trees (n\_estimators), minimum number of leaves (minleaf), and number of randomly selected node-split feature variables (max\_features), were optimized using a grid search method based on out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the pipeline does not involve any deep learning models.
