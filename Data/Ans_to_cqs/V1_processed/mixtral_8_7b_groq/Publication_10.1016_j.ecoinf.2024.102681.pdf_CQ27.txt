The context does not provide explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, it does mention that a hybrid CNN-LSTM model was used for drought propagation research.

The study "From meteorological to agricultural drought: Propagation time and influencing factors over diverse underlying surfaces based on CNN-LSTM model" by Junchen Long et al. discusses the development and testing of the model. They used a comprehensive dataset of various factors influencing drought propagation, which included a long time series from 1950 to 2020. The dataset was divided into 42 distinct datasets using a sliding window method.

The researchers then trained and tested their hybrid CNN-LSTM model using these datasets. They adjusted the size and number of convolution kernels and hyperparameters like the learning rate. After embedding the LSTM into the CNN, they found that the model's prediction accuracy improved by about 20% compared to the original CNN.

While the context does not provide specific details about deploying the trained model, it can be inferred that the model was likely deployed for testing and evaluation purposes. This might have involved serializing the model, saving its weights, and then loading it onto a platform suitable for running the model, such as a local machine or a cloud-based server. However, the text does not offer specifics on these processes.
