Based on the provided context, there is no information about postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix. The context focuses on the data acquisition and processing steps in Google Earth Engine (GEE) for creating a dataset that includes land cover types, wildfire locations, Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), and above-ground biomass data in mainland China.

The described steps include filtering the feature collection using the MCD64A1 date attribute "Burndate" to represent the fire occurrence area, extracting land cover types for each year by overlaying MCD12Q1, and calculating the annual Net Primary Production (NPP) using MOD17A3. The "ForestFireArea" image collection is then created by adding attribute information using the "image.addBands()" API.

However, the context does not mention any postprocessing steps after the model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given information.
