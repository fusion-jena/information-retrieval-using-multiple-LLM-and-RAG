Based on the provided context, it appears that the generalizability of the deep learning model was addressed through the use of a diverse dataset and the evaluation of the model's performance using multiple metrics.

First, the model was trained using synthetic data, which likely helped to increase the diversity of the training set. Synthetic data can be generated with a wide range of variations, including different lighting conditions, object poses, and backgrounds, which can help the model learn to handle a variety of situations.

Next, the model's performance was evaluated using several metrics, including Overall Accuracy, IoU, MA, and MIoU. In particular, the use of MIoU, which considers the individual values for each class within the dataset and computes their average, can enhance the reliability of the classification results for imbalanced data. This is important because imbalanced data can be a challenge for deep learning models, as they may be biased towards the majority class. By considering the performance of the model on each individual class, MIoU can help to ensure that the model is performing well on all classes, rather than just the majority class.

Additionally, the model was trained for 1000 epochs, and metrics such as MIoU or MA were computed after each epoch to analyze the training performance. This allowed the researchers to monitor the model's performance over time and ensure that it was not overfitting to the training data.

However, the context does not mention the use of techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are commonly used to further improve the generalizability of deep learning models. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on one subset and evaluating its performance on another subset, and repeating this process for all subsets. This can help to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and can generalize well to new data. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets in a way that preserves the distribution of classes, which can be particularly important when working with imbalanced data.

In summary, the generalizability of the deep learning model was addressed through the use of synthetic data and the evaluation of the model's performance using multiple metrics. However, it is not clear from the provided context whether techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to further improve the model's generalizability.
