The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that a cross-comparison method was used to validate the ApisFis model. This involved comparing the model's outcomes with validation data obtained from a field survey. The comparison was done for 12 sites, and it was observed that the field estimations were close to the model's predictions for most sites. However, there were instances where the field estimations were higher or lower than the model's predictions.

Moreover, the Apis-FIS model's performance was evaluated by comparing the culture map in the model with field data. This comparison demonstrated that data is essential for this decision-making instrument, and beekeepers need this information to quickly adapt to their requirements.

Additionally, the rules for the Apis-FIS subsystem were defined using fuzzy logic, and the fuzzy logic toolbox of Matlab 2023b was used to implement the FIS models. The toolbox provides large capabilities to choose several membership functions and to build any desired set of inference rules.

Therefore, while the specific strategy for monitoring the model's performance during training is not mentioned, it can be inferred that cross-comparison with field data and evaluating the culture map in the model were used to validate the ApisFis model's performance.
