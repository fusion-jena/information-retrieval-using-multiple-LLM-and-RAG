The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of pre-trained networks with convolutional layers, which are commonly used for image data. These networks are used to extract patterns within images efficiently. The output layer of these models consists of a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function, producing invasion predictions between 0.0 and 1.0. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline in this context uses image data.

The context also mentions the use of remotely sensed data, which can include various data formats such as raster images (e.g., satellite or aerial imagery), point clouds, and vector data. However, the specific data format used is not mentioned.

There is no mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files in the provided context.

In summary, while the provided context suggests that the deep learning pipeline uses image data, it does not explicitly mention the data formats used. Therefore, the answer to the query is: the deep learning pipeline uses image data, but the specific data formats are not mentioned in the provided context.
