The deep learning model in question is used for herbarium specimens classification. This is evident in the "Experiments and results" section where all the experiments conducted measure the top-1 and top-5 accuracy of the model in classifying herbarium specimens. The model's performance is evaluated under different circumstances such as transfer learning across herbarium data from different regions and transfer learning from herbarium data to non-dried plant images. The purpose of the model is to classify herbarium specimens accurately, and the results presented in the tables and figures suggest that the model performs well in this task.

The deep learning model is based on the GoogleNet architecture, as shown in Table 1, with batch normalization added outside the Inception modules for faster convergence. The modified Inception module is comprised of several pooling layers, and batch normalization is added after each pooling layer. The model is implemented using the Caffe framework and trained using a batch size of 16 images with a learning rate of 0.0075. Simple crop and resize data augmentation is used for training the model.

The study's discussion and conclusions further support the model's purpose of herbarium specimens classification. The authors state that the study is the first one to analyze a big dataset with thousands of specimen images from herbaria and use deep learning. The results show the potential of deep learning on herbarium species identification, particularly by training and testing across different herbarium datasets. The authors suggest that the model could potentially lead to the creation of a semi or fully automatic system to help taxonomists and experts do their annotation, classification, and revision work at herbarium.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is herbarium specimens classification.
