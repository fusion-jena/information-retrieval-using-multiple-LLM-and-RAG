Based on the provided context, there is no clear information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Norouzzadeh et al. (2018). The context describes the methodology, model architecture, and results of the study, but it does not mention where the data repository is available.

However, the study does mention that they used camera trap images from the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, and they collected additional images from publicly available sources such as the Snapshot Serengeti dataset (Knospe et al., 2015) and the Caltech Camera Traps dataset (Beery et al., 2018). It is possible that the data repository may be available on one of these platforms or through the authors' affiliated institutions.

Additionally, the study used the AlexNet deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model, which was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). The authors fine-tuned the model using their collected camera trap images, but they do not mention if they made their fine-tuned model available in a data repository.

Therefore, while the context provides valuable information about the study's methodology and results, it does not explicitly mention where the data repository is available. Further investigation may be necessary to locate the data repository.
