The provided context does not give specific details on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It only mentions that well-known values of hyperparameters were used for the deep learning algorithm and that these values were selected by a data scientist before machine learning began. It is possible that grid search, random search, or another hyperparameter optimization method was used, but the text does not provide enough information to make a definitive statement.
