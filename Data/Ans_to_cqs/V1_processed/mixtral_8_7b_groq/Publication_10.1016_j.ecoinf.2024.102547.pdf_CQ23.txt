Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the generalizability measures taken for a deep learning model. However, there are some implicit details that suggest the use of diverse datasets and dimension reduction techniques, which could indirectly contribute to the generalizability of a model.

Firstly, the context mentions the examination of data characterized by functional attributes distributed across a spatial domain, which includes dimension reduction techniques and supervised and unsupervised methods that consider spatial dependencies within extensive datasets. These methods could have been used to preprocess and prepare the data for a deep learning model, enhancing its ability to handle complex structures and relationships within the data.

Secondly, the context highlights the use of Functional Data Analysis (FDA), an alternative to diverse and heterogeneous datasets of functional, shape, or more complex structure. FDA focuses on the analysis of data that varies over a continuum, such as time or space, and aims to extract relevant features and patterns from such data. This approach could have been employed to extract meaningful information from the raw data and create a more informative and manageable dataset for the deep learning model.

Lastly, there are several references to studies that have worked with datasets related to oceanography, acoustic data, and mesopelagic zone biomass estimation. These studies might have provided the datasets used in the deep learning model, ensuring diversity and richness in the data.

While there is no direct mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting techniques, the use of diverse datasets, dimension reduction techniques, and FDA could indirectly contribute to the generalizability of a deep learning model by providing better-structured data, reducing overfitting, and enhancing the model's ability to capture complex relationships within the data.
