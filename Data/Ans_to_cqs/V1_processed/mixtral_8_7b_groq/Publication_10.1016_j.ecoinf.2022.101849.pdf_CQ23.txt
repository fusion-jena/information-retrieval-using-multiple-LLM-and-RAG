The provided context does not give specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does discuss some methods that could be used to improve the model's performance and applicability to real-world data.

First, the study formulates a new computational setting for regression, where target labels are structurally incomplete. This setting is then computationally studied via a case study in predictive modeling of global vegetation cover. This approach allows for the investigation of tailored methods for exploiting scarce and noisy target labels, which can improve the model's performance on real-world data.

Second, the study compares the mean absolute error (MAE) of a baseline approach and a partial imputation algorithm on artificially incomplete data. This comparison is repeated over 1000 repetitions for each experiment, which can help to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the results.

Third, the study uses two types of clusters in the partial imputation algorithm. While the specifics of these clusters are not provided, using clustering techniques can help to identify patterns and relationships in the data, which can improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, it does discuss methods that can contribute to the generalizability of a deep learning model. These methods include investigating tailored approaches for exploiting scarce and noisy target labels, comparing results over multiple repetitions, and using clustering techniques to identify patterns and relationships in the data.
