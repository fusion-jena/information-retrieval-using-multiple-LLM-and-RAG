The provided context does not give specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for the leaf classification task. However, it does mention that transfer learning is used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of deep learning models when training data is limited. The two most common strategies of transfer learning are feature extraction and fine-tuning. In the context of leaf classification, feature extraction is performed by using a pre-trained model as a feature extractor, and the bottleneck features are used as more generic features.

While the context does not provide information on data augmentation techniques, it is worth noting that data augmentation is a common technique used to increase the size and diversity of training data in deep learning. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping are often used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize to new data. By applying these transformations to the training data, the model can learn to be invariant to these transformations, which can improve its performance on new data.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention data augmentation techniques, it is likely that data augmentation was used in the deep learning pipeline for leaf classification to increase the size and diversity of the training data.
