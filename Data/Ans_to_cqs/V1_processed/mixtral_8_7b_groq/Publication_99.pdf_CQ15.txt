The deep learning pipeline described in the context utilizes several optimization techniques. The primary optimization techniques used are the Adam optimizer and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), although the latter is not explicitly mentioned but implied through the use of learning rates.

For the PConv networks, the Adam optimizer is used with a learning rate of 2e-4. Similarly, for the Pix2Pix networks, the Adam optimizer is utilized with a learning rate of 9e-5. The Classification networks, on the other hand, use the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.03 for training from scratch and 0.0002 for pre-trained networks.

SGD is implied through the use of learning rates in the context. For instance, the Classification networks trained from scratch use a learning rate of 0.03, which is a typical value for SGD. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of SGD.

Additionally, other optimization techniques are used in conjunction with the optimizers. For the PConv networks, a two-phase training process is initially required due to the generated holes' problem for batch normalization. However, in this study, all models were trained in a single process while freezing the batch normalization layer in the encoder part.

For the Pix2Pix networks, after every 500 iterations, the performance of the generator models is evaluated using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Peak Signal-To-Noise Ratio (PSNR) metrics. The model is saved as the best model if it has improved the performance on the validation set compared to previous iterations.

For the Classification networks, various data augmentation techniques such as height and width shift, flipping, zooming, and brightness changes are used. These techniques help improve the model's generalization and prevent overfitting.

In summary, the Adam optimizer is the primary optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context. However, SGD is implied through the use of learning rates. Other optimization techniques, such as batch normalization, data augmentation, and model evaluation metrics, are also used to improve the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
