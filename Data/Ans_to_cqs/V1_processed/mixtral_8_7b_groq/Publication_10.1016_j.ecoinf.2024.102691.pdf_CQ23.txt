Based on the provided context, the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, are not explicitly mentioned. However, there are some details about the training process and model architecture that can contribute to the model's ability to generalize.

Firstly, during model training, the input image size was set to 512 Ã— 512, and the maximum batch size was limited to 4. This consistent input size can help the model to learn features more effectively, which can improve its ability to generalize.

Secondly, to prevent underfitting, all models were ensured to follow back-propagation after accumulating the batch size 32 times. This technique, known as batch normalization, can help the model to converge faster and reduce overfitting, thereby improving its ability to generalize.

Thirdly, the models were trained using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and a cycle learning rate of 0.2. The use of a cyclical learning rate policy can help the model to explore the weight space more effectively, which can improve its ability to generalize.

Lastly, the depth-attention mechanism was placed after the final processing layers of the detection model and remains unchanged throughout the learning process. This means that the depth-attention weights are not updated during training and remain fixed. By keeping the attention mechanism fixed, the model may be less prone to overfitting to the training data, which can improve its ability to generalize.

However, it is important to note that without explicit mention of techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or a diverse dataset, the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model may be limited.
