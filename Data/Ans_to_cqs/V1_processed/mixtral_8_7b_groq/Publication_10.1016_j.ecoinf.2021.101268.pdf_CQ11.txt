Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. There is a mention of a new Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset, but there is no indication of where this dataset has been shared or made publicly available. Additionally, the context describes the use of various deep learning architectures for scan/pseudo scan leaf classification, but it does not provide a link to the code or models used in this pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
