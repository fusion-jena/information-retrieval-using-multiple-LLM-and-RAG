The provided context does not directly discuss data bias mitigation techniques during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention several methods related to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data preprocessing, which can provide some insights.

NDVI is a commonly used vegetation index in remote sensing and ecological studies. Preprocessing NDVI data may involve techniques such as time-series reconstruction, cloud removal, and handling data gaps. Some of the methods mentioned in the context include:

1. Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS): This method, proposed by Zhou et al. (2015, 2021), is used for global MODIS NDVI time series reconstruction. It decomposes the NDVI time series into harmonics, enabling the estimation of missing data points and the reduction of noise.
2. Savitzky-Golay filter: Chen et al. (2004) proposed a simple method for reconstructing high-quality NDVI time-series data based on the Savitzky-Golay filter. This filter is a digital signal processing technique used for smoothing noisy data and can help reduce data bias.
3. SAR to optical image synthesis with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Bermudez et al. (2018) presented a method for cloud removal using GANs. This technique can help create more complete and unbiased NDVI datasets by filling in gaps caused by clouds.

While these methods do not explicitly address data bias mitigation techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling, they do contribute to creating more accurate and complete NDVI datasets, which can help reduce data bias indirectly.

In summary, the provided context discusses various NDVI data preprocessing methods, including time-series reconstruction, cloud removal, and gap filling. These techniques can help improve data quality and reduce data bias indirectly. However, specific data bias mitigation techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling are not mentioned in the context.
