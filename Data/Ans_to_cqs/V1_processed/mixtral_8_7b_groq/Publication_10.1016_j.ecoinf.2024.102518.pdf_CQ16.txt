The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criterion used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does provide information about the cross-validation process and the metrics used to evaluate the models.

In the study, nine algorithms were evaluated using AUC-ROC and Cohen's KAPPA metrics, and the MaxEnt algorithm was found to be the most suitable model. The Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) was also used in addition to the AUC-ROC because AUC-ROC can be unreliable when obtaining true absences is challenging.

The optimal model was determined by setting the regularization multiplier from 0.5 to 5 and using the delta in the Akaike minimum information criterion (delta.AICc) as the metric to determine the best tuning parameters. The optimal model is the one with the minimum delta.AICc value (delta.AICc = 0), and a model with delta.AICc <2 is considered credible.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention a validation loss plateau as a criterion for determining when training is complete, it does describe a rigorous cross-validation process and the use of multiple metrics to evaluate and select the optimal model.
