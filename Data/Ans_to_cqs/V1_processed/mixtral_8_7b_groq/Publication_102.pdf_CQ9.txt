The data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available on Zenodo, as described in reference [23] and [25]. Specifically, the Aerial Elephant Dataset, which is used in the pipeline, can be found in the Zenodo repository with the DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3234780. This dataset was created by Naudé JJ and Joubert D in 2019 and it is a new public benchmark for aerial object detection. The dataset includes images of elephants in aerial views, which are used to train and test the deep learning models for object detection. The use of this dataset is crucial for the reproducibility and transparency of the deep learning pipeline.
