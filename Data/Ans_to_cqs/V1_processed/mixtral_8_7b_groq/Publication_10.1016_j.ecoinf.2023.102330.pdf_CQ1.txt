The provided context discusses the use of Acoustic Recording Units (ARUs) for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for acoustic detection and localization of bobwhite covey calls. ARUs are autonomous recording devices that can be deployed in the field to capture audio data over extended periods. This method allows for the collection of large datasets, which are essential for training deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

In the context, researchers used ARUs to record audio data, which were then analyzed using a previously developed CNN model trained on covey call spectrogram data. The CNN model was trained to detect and localize all covey calls per ARU during the recording period and note their associated time and peak power.

While the context focuses on the use of ARUs for data collection, other methods for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines can include surveys, other types of sensors, and public datasets. Surveys can be used to collect data through targeted sampling of specific populations or environments. Sensors, such as microphones, cameras, or accelerometers, can be used to collect data continuously or in response to specific triggers. Public datasets, which can be obtained from repositories or data sharing platforms, can provide large and diverse datasets for training deep learning models.

In summary, the provided context discusses the use of ARUs for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for acoustic detection and localization of bobwhite covey calls. However, other methods for collecting raw data can include surveys, sensors, and public datasets. The choice of data collection method will depend on the specific research question, the availability of resources, and the characteristics of the data required for training the deep learning model.
