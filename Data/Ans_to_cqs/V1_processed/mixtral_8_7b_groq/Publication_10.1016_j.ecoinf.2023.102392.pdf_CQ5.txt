Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. The studies focus on the application of deep learning models, specifically the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model, for land use/land cover classification and forest type categorization using images collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and SPOT satellite equipment. However, the names of the datasets used in these studies are not provided.

In general, the datasets commonly used in deep learning research include MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, CIFAR for object recognition, and ImageNet for large-scale image classification. These datasets are widely used as benchmarks for evaluating the performance of deep learning models. However, the context does not specify if any of these standard datasets were used in the studies.
