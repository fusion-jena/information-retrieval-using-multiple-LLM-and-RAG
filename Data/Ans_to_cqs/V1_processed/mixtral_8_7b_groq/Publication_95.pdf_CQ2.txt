The data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context is images. The study focuses on training deep convolutional neural networks for image classification tasks. The images are taken as the input data for the neural networks. Before being processed by the network, the images undergo a three-step data augmentation procedure, which includes randomly flipping the image horizontally, scaling the contrast of each image channel by a random factor, and randomly cropping the image to a square.

The context does not mention the use of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files in this particular deep learning pipeline. However, it is important to note that the choice of data format largely depends on the specific problem and task at hand. Deep learning models can be trained on various data formats, including time-series data (audio, sensor data), spatial data (images, videos), and structured data (CSV, tabular data). The selection of the appropriate data format is determined by the nature of the data and the problem being addressed.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline described in the context uses images as the data format, but deep learning models can be trained on various data formats, such as audio, video, and CSV files, depending on the specific problem and task.
