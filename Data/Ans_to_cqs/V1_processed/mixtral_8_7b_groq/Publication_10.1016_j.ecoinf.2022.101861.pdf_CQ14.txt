Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific hyperparameters of a model being optimized, or the methods used for optimization such as grid search or random search. The context focuses on the process of identifying the Brazilian nightjar with the least information available, using a combined index based on the number of scientific articles, observations on a citizen science platform (eBird), and recordings on a public online database of sounds (Xeno-canto). The selection of nightjar species is based on sightings uploaded to eBird in the Brazilian Pantanal, and Kaleidoscope is used to extract sounds that satisfy specific signal parameters. However, there is no mention of a model or its hyperparameters being optimized in this process.
