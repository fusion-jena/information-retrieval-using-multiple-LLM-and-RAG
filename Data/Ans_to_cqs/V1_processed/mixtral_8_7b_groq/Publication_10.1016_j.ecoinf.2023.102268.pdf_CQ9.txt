Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text describes the methods used for feature extraction, classification, and model selection, but it does not mention where the data or code for the pipeline is stored or made available for public access. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query. It is possible that the data repository is not specified in the given text, and further investigation would be needed to find this information.
