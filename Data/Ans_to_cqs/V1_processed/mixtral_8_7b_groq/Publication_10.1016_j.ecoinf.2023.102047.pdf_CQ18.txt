The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of early stopping, which is a form of regularization used to avoid overfitting. Specifically, the validation loss is monitored during training time for every epoch on the validation set. If the validation loss does not decrease for a certain number of epochs (referred to as patience), the training process is stopped, and the model with the lowest validation loss is selected as the final model.

In this case, a patience of 20 was chosen, which means that if the validation loss does not decrease for 20 consecutive epochs, the training process will be stopped. Additionally, a batch size of 16 and a number of epochs of 500 were set for the training process.

It is important to note that the validation loss is a measure of how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data. Therefore, monitoring the validation loss during training provides insight into how well the model is likely to perform on new data, rather than just the training data.

Furthermore, the use of early stopping allows for more efficient use of computational resources, as it prevents the training process from continuing indefinitely if the model is not improving. This is particularly important when training large models or working with large datasets, as training can be a time-consuming and computationally intensive process.

Overall, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of early stopping to prevent overfitting and improve generalization, while also increasing the efficiency of the training process.
