Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on data filtering and scaling processes for environmental Earth observation (EOS) data using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform.

However, it is important to note that optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam are not specific to data preprocessing or GEE. These techniques are primarily used during the training phase of deep learning models to minimize the loss function and find optimal parameters.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention any specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, these techniques are typically applied during the training phase of deep learning models and are not directly related to data preprocessing or GEE.
