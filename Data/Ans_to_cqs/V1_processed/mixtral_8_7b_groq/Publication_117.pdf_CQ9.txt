The data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available on Zenodo, a free and open-access platform for researchers to share and preserve their data. The specific DOI for the source code of the deep learning method is http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2562058. This repository includes the code for the convolutional neural network (CNN) used in the study, which was trained using a dataset of 500 survey images and pretrained weights from the COCO dataset provided by Redmon & Farhadi (2018). The CNN was then used to detect and count wildebeest in the survey images. The data and code repository on Zenodo allows for reproducibility and transparency of the deep learning pipeline used in the study.
