The specific type of deep learning model used in the proposed framework is an attention-based AODEGRU model. This model is a combination of Adaptive Online Deep Learning (AODE) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), enhanced with an attention mechanism. The AODE component aids in addressing the issue of data variability and interpretability, while the GRU component is suitable for handling sequential data, which can be useful for time-series water quality data. The attention mechanism further improves the model's performance by focusing on the most relevant features in the input data. This model is customized for water pollution analysis in aquaculture, aiming to provide increased accuracy and efficiency while addressing scaling issues prevalent in other deep learning models.
