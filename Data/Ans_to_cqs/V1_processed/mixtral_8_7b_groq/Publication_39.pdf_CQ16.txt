The pieces of context provided do not explicitly state the specific criterion used to determine when training is complete. However, they do mention some details about the training process that can give us some insight.

In the first context, it is mentioned that the models are trained for a fixed number of epochs, which is 30 for the SlowFast architecture. This suggests that the training process is not determined by a dynamic criterion such as a validation loss plateau, but rather by a predetermined schedule.

In the second context, the training process for the SlowFast architecture is described in more detail. It mentions that the learning rate is decreased with a cosine strategy, but it does not specify any criterion for stopping the training process.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it appears that the training process is not determined by a dynamic criterion such as a validation loss plateau, but rather by a predetermined schedule. Specifically, the models are trained for a fixed number of epochs, and the learning rate is decreased according to a predetermined strategy. However, it is important to note that this conclusion is based on the provided context, and it is possible that other criteria were used in the training process that were not mentioned in the context.
