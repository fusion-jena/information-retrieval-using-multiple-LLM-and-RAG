The provided context discusses the use of various machine learning models, including some that can be considered "deep learning" models, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). However, the preprocessing steps taken before training these models are not explicitly stated in the text. Therefore, I will provide a general answer regarding common preprocessing steps for deep learning models.


Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to ensure the data's quality and compatibility with the model. These steps include:

1. Data cleaning: This step involves handling missing or corrupted data points. Common techniques include removing rows with missing values, imputing missing values with statistical measures (e.g., mean, median, or mode), or using advanced methods like multiple imputation by chained equations (MICE).

2. Data normalization or scaling: Deep learning models, especially those using gradient-based optimization, can benefit from normalized or scaled input features. Common normalization techniques include min-max scaling, which scales features between 0 and 1, and z-score scaling, which standardizes features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

3. Feature engineering: This step involves creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance. Techniques include polynomial feature creation, interaction terms, and one-hot encoding for categorical variables.

4. Data splitting: The dataset is typically split into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to fit the model, the validation set is used for hyperparameter tuning, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

5. Handling class imbalance: For classification tasks, if the dataset has an imbalanced class distribution, techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or generating synthetic samples (using methods like SMOTE) can be applied.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these preprocessing steps, it is essential to perform these steps when working with deep learning models to ensure optimal performance.
