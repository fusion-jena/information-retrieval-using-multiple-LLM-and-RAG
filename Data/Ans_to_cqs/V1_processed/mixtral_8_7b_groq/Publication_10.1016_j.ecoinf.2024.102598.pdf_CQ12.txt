Based on the provided context, the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. The text discusses the use of machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, and makes references to ensemble modeling and advancements in machine learning models. However, it does not specify whether a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or any other type of deep learning model was employed. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
