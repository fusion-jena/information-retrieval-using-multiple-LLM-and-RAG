Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The text focuses on the improvements made to the Waveman model, including the modification of BatNet and the optimization of parameter settings. It explains how a new type of BNorm layers was added behind the 22 convolutional layers to prevent overfitting and enhance the model's ability to generalize from both "known" and "unknown" datasets. The concept of batch size and its role in limiting the number of images trained at once is also discussed. However, the specific postprocessing steps after the model training are not mentioned.
