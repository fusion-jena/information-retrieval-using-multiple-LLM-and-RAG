The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of ResNet101 and ResNet50 models, both of which are types of CNNs. The ResNet101 model, used for bird object detection, is initialized with pretrained COCO weights, indicating its use as a CNN. Additionally, the context describes image augmentation techniques such as horizontal flips, shear, and random zoom, which are commonly applied to image data in CNN-based models. Therefore, it can be concluded that the pipeline primarily uses CNNs for object detection and species identification.
