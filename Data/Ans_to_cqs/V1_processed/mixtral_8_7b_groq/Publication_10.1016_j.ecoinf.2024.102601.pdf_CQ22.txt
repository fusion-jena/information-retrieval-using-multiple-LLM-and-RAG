The provided context does not indicate the use of a deep learning model for wildfire area identification. Instead, it mentions the use of a random forest (RF) algorithm for multi-layer classification. However, I can provide information on how the RF model's performance is evaluated using the given context.

The performance of the RF model is evaluated using two primary metrics: Overall Accuracy (OA) and Cohen's Kappa statistic.

OA is the proportion of correctly predicted instances (wildfire-affected and unaffected areas) out of the total instances evaluated. It can be expressed mathematically as:

OA = (number of correct predictions) / (total number of instances)

Cohen's Kappa statistic is a measure of agreement between the predicted and true labels, considering the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance. It is calculated as:

Kappa = (Observed agreement - Expected agreement) / (1 - Expected agreement)

For the RF model's hyperparameter optimization, the context provides specific values for n_estimators, max_features, min_samples_split, and max_depth. The models RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV are used for hyperparameter tuning.

The evaluation metrics used during the hyperparameter optimization are not explicitly stated in the context. However, it is mentioned that the model achieves a training accuracy of 1.0 and a validation accuracy of 0.924.

In summary, the performance of the RF model is evaluated using Overall Accuracy (OA) and Cohen's Kappa statistic. The model's training and validation accuracy are also provided as a measure of its performance. The context does not mention any metrics used to evaluate a deep learning model.
