The Adam optimization method is used in the deep learning pipeline for training a U-Net neural network to identify and grade maize drought on RGB images captured by a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) [23]. Adam, proposed by Kingma and Ba in 2014, is a method for stochastic optimization that only requires first-order gradients with little memory overhead [27]. It is a popular optimization technique in deep learning due to its efficiency and effectiveness.

Adam combines the advantages of two other optimization methods: AdaGrad and RMSProp. AdaGrad is an optimization method that adapts the learning rate to the parameters, giving faster learning for parameters with high gradients and slower learning for parameters with low gradients [27]. RMSProp, on the other hand, is an optimization method that adapts the learning rate based on the moving average of the squared gradients [27]. Adam uses the best of both worlds by computing individual adaptive learning rates for different parameters from estimates of first and second moments of the gradients [27].

In the context of the study [23], the authors used the Adam optimizer to train their U-Net model for maize drought identification and grading. The U-Net model is a convolutional neural network that was originally developed for biomedical image segmentation [24]. It has since been successfully applied to various other segmentation tasks, including vegetation segmentation from high-resolution UAV-based RGB images [24]. The authors of [24] mentioned that the U-Net neural network should converge with a relatively small amount of data, which is an advantage when working with limited labeled data.

In summary, the Adam optimization method is used in the deep learning pipeline for training a U-Net neural network to identify and grade maize drought on RGB images captured by a UAV. Adam is a popular optimization technique in deep learning due to its efficiency and effectiveness, combining the advantages of AdaGrad and RMSProp.
