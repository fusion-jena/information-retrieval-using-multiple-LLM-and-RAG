The text provided does not give specific information about techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of deep learning pipelines. However, it does mention some methods used in machine learning and species distribution modeling that could potentially be used to address data bias.

In the context of mapping forecasts of different algorithms in an ensemble approach, Phillips et al. (2006) used selected algorithms with regression and classification prediction tasks to ensure the processing of both continuous and categorical discrete values in the metadata. This suggests that they may have used techniques such as oversampling or undersampling to address imbalanced data.

Jiang et al. (2022) provide a review of machine learning advances in microbiology, including methods and applications. They mention that data preprocessing is an important step in machine learning, which includes techniques such as data cleaning, normalization, and transformation. However, they do not explicitly mention techniques for addressing data bias.

Jiménez-Valverde (2012) discusses the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a discrimination measure in species distribution modeling. The AUC is a threshold-independent measure of model performance, which can be useful in cases of imbalanced data.

Jones and Hallin (2010) discuss ecological and evolutionary factors underlying global and local assembly of denitrifier communities. They mention that rare species can have a large impact on community structure and function, which suggests the importance of addressing data bias in such cases.

Thuiller et al. (2009) introduce BIOMOD, a platform for ensemble forecasting of species distributions. They mention that the BIOMOD platform can handle different types of data bias, such as spatial and temporal autocorrelation, and can use techniques such as cross-validation and bootstrapping to address such bias.

Topçuoğlu et al. (2020) propose a framework for effective application of machine learning to microbiome-based classification problems. They mention the importance of addressing data bias in such problems, and suggest techniques such as rarefaction, subsampling, and data augmentation to address such bias.

Overall, while the text provided does not give specific information about techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of deep learning pipelines, it does suggest that techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, cross-validation, bootstrapping, rarefaction, subsampling, and data augmentation could be used to address data bias in machine learning and species distribution modeling. Additionally, the use of threshold-independent measures such as AUC can be useful in cases of imbalanced data.
