Based on the provided context, there are several postprocessing steps that can be inferred to be involved after the model training. However, the specific step of generating saliency maps is not mentioned.

Firstly, metrics calculation is performed after the model training. The metrics calculated include the mean squared error (MSE), mean average percentage error (MAPE), and average accuracy (Acc%). These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for predicting river age, sea age, and spawning. The MSE is a measure of the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values, while the MAPE is the average absolute difference between the actual and predicted values, expressed as a percentage of the actual value. The Acc% is the percentage of correct predictions made by the model.

Secondly, a confusion matrix can be inferred to be calculated based on the given information. A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It compares the predicted classifications with the actual classifications and can be used to calculate various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. In the provided context, the Acc% can be seen as a metric derived from a confusion matrix.

Thirdly, the context mentions the use of a specific training data configuration for the CNN models, which includes the number of epochs without improvement in validation error before training will terminate early. This can be seen as a form of early stopping, which is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting.

Lastly, the context provides information on the weighting of classes for the spawning prediction task. This can be seen as a form of class balancing, which is a technique used to address the issue of imbalanced class distributions in a dataset.

In conclusion, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include metrics calculation, confusion matrix, early stopping, and class balancing. However, the specific step of generating saliency maps is not mentioned in the provided context.
