Based on the provided context, there is no information about the use of specific hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs for training a deep learning model. The context focuses on the discussion of an algorithm called MTMI-SMF (Multitemporal and Multispectral Fusion) and its application in ecological and conservation contexts. The text highlights the efficiency of MTMI-SMF in handling training data and its ability to deal with mixed pixels, which is a common issue in ecological applications.

Furthermore, the context includes confusion matrices for RapidEye, Landsat, and NAIP imagery using MTMI-SMF and Random Forest, respectively. However, these matrices do not provide information about the hardware resources used for training.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model.
