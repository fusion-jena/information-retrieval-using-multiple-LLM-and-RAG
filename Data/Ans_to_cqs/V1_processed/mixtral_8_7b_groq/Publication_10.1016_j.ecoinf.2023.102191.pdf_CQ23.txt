The provided context does not contain information about the development or implementation of a deep learning model. The text focuses on the testing of a monitoring program for recreational SCUBA diving, using a mobile app called Dive Reporter to collect standardized data on marine taxa. Measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as creating a diverse dataset, using cross-validation, and stratified splitting, are not mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given context.
