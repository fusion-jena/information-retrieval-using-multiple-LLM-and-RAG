Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in the BirdNET project. The text focuses on the description of BirdNET, its capabilities, and the settings used for bird vocalization detection, but it does not mention the specific data split strategy.

However, it is essential to note that data splitting is a common practice in machine learning projects, including deep learning. Generally, the dataset is divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing.

1. Training set: This set is used to train the model, allowing it to learn the underlying patterns in the data.
2. Validation set: This set is used during the training process to validate and tune the model's hyperparameters. It helps to ensure that the model does not overfit or underfit the training data.
3. Testing set: This set is used to evaluate the model's performance after training and hyperparameter tuning. It provides an unbiased estimate of the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

In the context of BirdNET, the authors might have used a similar data splitting strategy, but the specific criteria are not provided. It is possible that the authors did not include these details in their text, focusing instead on the BirdNET project's main contributions and findings.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in the BirdNET project. However, it is common practice to divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets in machine learning projects.
