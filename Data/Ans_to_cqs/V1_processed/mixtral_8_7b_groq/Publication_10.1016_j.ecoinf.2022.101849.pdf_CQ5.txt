The provided context does not include information about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on a case study of predictive modeling of global vegetation cover and the concept of structurally incomplete target labels in regression tasks. It mentions various machine learning methods like neural networks, random forests, gradient boosting, and k-nearest neighbors, but it does not specify any particular dataset used in the deep learning pipeline.

Commonly used datasets in deep learning pipelines include MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, CIFAR for image classification, and ImageNet for large-scale object recognition. However, these datasets are not mentioned in the provided context.
