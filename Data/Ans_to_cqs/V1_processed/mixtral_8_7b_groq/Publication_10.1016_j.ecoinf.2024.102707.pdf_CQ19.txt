The provided context does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning frameworks were used to build the model. However, it does mention that the study used YOLOv6, which is an object detection algorithm. YOLOv6 can be implemented using different deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, while the exact framework is not specified, it can be inferred that either TensorFlow or PyTorch was used in this study.
