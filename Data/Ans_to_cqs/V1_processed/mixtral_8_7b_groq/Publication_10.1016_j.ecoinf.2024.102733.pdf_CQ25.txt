The deep learning model in question serves the purpose of classification. This is evident in the context provided, as the model is designed to predict the event class by comparing the values of the 12 neurons in the last layer to the real event ground truth. Each neuron in the last layer corresponds to one of the events, and the maximum neuron value is used for predicting the event class. This process is facilitated by a loss function, which updates the model parameters and performs the training. Therefore, the deep learning model is designed to classify events based on the learned features extracted from the diffusion model.
