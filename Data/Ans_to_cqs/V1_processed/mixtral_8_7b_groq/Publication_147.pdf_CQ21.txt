Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or XGBoost (XGB) models. However, there are some common postprocessing steps that are often used in machine learning projects, which could be applied in this context as well.

Some possible postprocessing steps could be:

1. **Metrics calculation:** After obtaining the predictions from the model, it is important to calculate the evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the model. The context does not specify which metrics were used for evaluation, but common metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
2. **Confusion matrix:** A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It can provide information about the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative counts, which can be used to calculate various metrics.
3. **Saliency maps:** Saliency maps are a technique used to visualize the importance of input features for a given prediction. They can be useful for understanding which features the model is focusing on and can help identify potential issues or biases in the model.
4. **Hyperparameter tuning:** Although the context mentions that the models were trained and optimized, it does not specify the exact hyperparameters that were used. Hyperparameter tuning is an important postprocessing step that involves adjusting the hyperparameters of the model to improve its performance.
5. **Model ensembling:** Model ensembling is a technique that involves combining the predictions of multiple models to improve the overall performance. This can be useful when different models have different strengths and weaknesses.

It is important to note that the specific postprocessing steps used will depend on the problem at hand and the goals of the project. Therefore, the actual postprocessing steps used for the CNN and XGB models in this context may differ from the ones listed above.
