The text provided does not give specific details about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention that they calibrated models for classification challenges using different numbers of training steps as one of the hyperparameters. They chose 4000 training steps as the optimum number for all challenges except Challenge 3, where they used 8000 training steps. This was determined by considering the correct identification rate and processing time.

The model architecture used is a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a type of deep neural network (DNN) specialized for image classification tasks and pattern recognition. CNNs have three types of layers: convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The convolutional layers apply hierarchical feature extraction and decomposition of input images, while the pooling layers reduce the number of parameters and computation. The fully connected layers perform the actual classification at the end of the pipeline.

Additional hyperparameters for future consideration include restricting candidate species pools based on biogeographic realm, ectomorph type, and classification for fine-tuning TensorFlow's automation of species recognition. Other caveats for future development include single notes per species and limited sample sizes for rare species or those that occur at naturally low abundances or have reduced detection probabilities due to cryptic microhabitat preferences, narrow activity patterns, or seasonally-limited reproductive cycles.

In summary, while the text provides information about the training steps and model architecture used, it does not give specific details about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model.
