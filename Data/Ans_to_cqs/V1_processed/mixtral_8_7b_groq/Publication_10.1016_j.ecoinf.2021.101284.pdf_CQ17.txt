Based on the provided texts, there is no direct mention of the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, one of the texts, "Early diagnosis of covid-19-affected patients based on x-ray and computed tomography images using deep learning algorithm" by Castillo (2020), does discuss the use of deep learning algorithms in the context of COVID-19 diagnosis.

Deep learning algorithms are a type of machine learning algorithm that are particularly well-suited to handling large and complex datasets, such as those associated with medical imaging. However, these algorithms can be prone to overfitting, which occurs when the model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on new, unseen data.

Regularization methods, such as dropout and L2 regularization, are techniques that can be used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Dropout involves randomly setting a fraction of the model's weights to zero during training, which helps to prevent the model from becoming too reliant on any one set of weights. L2 regularization, on the other hand, involves adding a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the model's weights. This encourages the model to keep its weights small, which can help to prevent overfitting.

Without more information from the provided texts, it is not possible to say for certain whether these regularization methods were used in the deep learning pipeline described in the Castillo (2020) text. However, it is mentioned that the deep learning algorithm used in the study was based on a pre-trained model, which may have already incorporated regularization techniques.

In summary, while the provided texts do not directly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, it is reasonable to assume that such techniques may have been used in the deep learning pipeline described in the Castillo (2020) text.
