The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the ICSNet deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the number of epochs is 200, and the initial learning rate is 0.0004. These parameters are related to optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and adaptive learning rate methods like Adam.

In deep learning, the most common optimization techniques are SGD and its variants, such as Momentum SGD, Adagrad, Adadelta, and Adam. The choice of optimization technique can significantly impact the training process and the final performance of the model.

SGD is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters by computing the gradient of the loss function for a single training example (or a small batch of examples) at each iteration. SGD is widely used due to its efficiency and ease of implementation.

Adam is an adaptive learning rate method that combines the advantages of Adagrad and Momentum. Adam maintains an estimate of the first and second moments of the gradients and uses these estimates to adapt the learning rate for each parameter. Adam has been shown to perform well in practice and is a popular choice for deep learning applications.

Considering the provided context, it is likely that an optimization technique like SGD or Adam was used in the ICSNet deep learning pipeline. However, without explicit information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
