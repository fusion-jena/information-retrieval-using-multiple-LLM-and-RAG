The text provided does not give specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that an ensemble of machine learning models was trained, tested, and evaluated using 68 open-access predictor layers, which were added to a geographic information system (GIS) platform. This suggests that the data used in the study is likely in a format that can be used with GIS software, such as a raster or vector format. Additionally, the study resulted in predictions at a 100-m resolution, which implies that the data used may include spatial data. The predictor layers likely include socio-economic data from the US Census, which is available in a variety of formats, including CSV. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to definitively say which data formats were used in the deep learning pipeline.
