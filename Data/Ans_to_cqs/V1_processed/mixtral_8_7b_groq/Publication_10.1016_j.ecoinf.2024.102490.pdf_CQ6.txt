The provided context discusses the creation and evaluation of models for predicting the climatic suitability of certain species, but it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention some data processing techniques that are commonly used as preprocessing steps in machine learning tasks.

When preparing data for machine learning models, including deep learning models, data preprocessing is a crucial step. This process can include various techniques such as data cleaning, normalization, and scaling.

Data cleaning involves handling missing or inconsistent data points. For instance, missing values can be replaced with imputed values, or rows with missing data can be removed entirely. In the provided context, it is not explicitly stated whether any data cleaning was performed, but it is mentioned that 80% of the data was used for training, and 20% for evaluation, indicating that some form of data splitting was performed.

Normalization and scaling are techniques used to adjust the range of features in a dataset. Normalization typically involves rescaling features to a range of 0 to 1, while scaling can involve adjusting features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. These techniques can help improve model performance by reducing the impact of outlier values or differences in scales between features.

In the provided context, it is mentioned that bioclimatic layers were cropped using QGIS, but it is not explicitly stated whether any normalization or scaling was performed on the data. However, it is mentioned that various machine learning algorithms were used, including XGBOOST, GBM, and RF, which are commonly used in conjunction with normalization and scaling techniques.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model, it is likely that some form of data cleaning, normalization, or scaling was performed, as these are common preprocessing techniques used in machine learning tasks.
