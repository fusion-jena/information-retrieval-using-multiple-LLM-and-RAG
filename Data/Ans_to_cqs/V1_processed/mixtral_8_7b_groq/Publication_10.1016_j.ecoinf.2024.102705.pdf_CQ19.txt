The context provided does not explicitly mention which framework was used to build the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based on the given information.

However, it is worth noting that both TensorFlow and PyTorch are popular open-source frameworks for building deep learning models. They provide extensive functionalities and tools that facilitate the design, training, and implementation of neural networks. Given the widespread use of these frameworks in the machine learning community, it is plausible that either TensorFlow or PyTorch (or potentially another framework) was used to construct the deep learning model in this study.

In conclusion, while the specific framework remains undisclosed in the context, it is likely that a well-known framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, was employed to build the deep learning model.
