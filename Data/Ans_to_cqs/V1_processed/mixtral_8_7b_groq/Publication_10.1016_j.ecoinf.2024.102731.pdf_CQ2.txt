Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline appears to use raster format data, which is a grid of pixels with each pixel containing a value representing a specific attribute. This format is used for the vegetation, land cover, and climate data. For instance, the vegetation data is represented in the form of sparse vegetation cover (tree, shrub, herbaceous cover) with varying densities, bare areas, croplands, mosaics of vegetation and croplands, flooded tree cover, and shrub or herbaceous cover in fresh, saline, or brackish water. Similarly, climate data is provided by sources like WorldClim and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with a resolution of 30m is acquired from the Copernicus program.

However, the context does not explicitly mention other data formats such as image, audio, video, or CSV. It is possible that these formats are not used in this particular deep learning pipeline.
