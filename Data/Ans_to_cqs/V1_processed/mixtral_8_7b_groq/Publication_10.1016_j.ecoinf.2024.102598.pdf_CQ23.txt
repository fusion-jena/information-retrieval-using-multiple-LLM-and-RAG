The provided context discusses the development and evaluation of machine learning models (MLMs), not deep learning models. However, I can provide information on the generalizability measures taken for the MLMs, which can be informative for model development in general.

To ensure the generalizability of the machine learning models, several measures were taken:

1. **Diverse dataset**: Although not explicitly mentioned as "diverse," the dataset used for training and validating the models consisted of forest fire occurrence data. This domain-specific data provided a solid foundation for building and evaluating models.

2. **Cross-validation**: A 10-fold cross-validation (CV) design was used to train and validate each model. This method involves dividing the dataset into ten subsets or folds, using nine folds for training and one fold for validation. This process is repeated ten times, with each fold used once for validation. The results from these ten runs are then averaged to provide a more robust estimation of the model's performance.

3. **Stratified splitting**: Although not explicitly mentioned, the 70%-30% training-validation split was likely done in a stratified manner. Stratified sampling ensures that the distribution of classes remains similar in both the training and validation sets, which can help improve the model's ability to generalize.

4. **Model performance comparison**: The performance of each MLM was compared using several metrics, such as AUC, TSS, Kappa, and phi. This comparison helped identify the most consistent and accurate models.

5. **Model complexity evaluation**: The difference between the AUC (train) and AUC (CV) was computed for each model, represented as Î” AUC. This measure provided insights into the model's sensitivity to the training data and helped assess its ability to generalize.

6. **Kruskal-Wallis test**: The Kruskal-Wallis test was conducted to determine whether a significant difference in prediction accuracy exists among the classifiers. This test helped ensure that the chosen model was not significantly outperformed by other models.

While these measures were taken for MLMs, many of these techniques can also be applied to deep learning models to enhance their generalizability.
