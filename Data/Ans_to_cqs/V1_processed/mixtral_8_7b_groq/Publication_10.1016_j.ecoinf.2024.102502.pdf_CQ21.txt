Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, the text does mention some processing steps related to data curation, data scaling, and gap filling that are carried out within Google Earth Engine (GEE) during data extraction.

The postprocessing steps typically follow the training of a machine learning or statistical model and are used to evaluate the model's performance, visualize the results, and interpret the model's behavior. These steps may include generating Saliency maps, calculating various metrics, and creating Confusion matrices.

Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the important features or regions in the input data that contribute to the model's predictions. Metrics calculation involves assessing the model's performance using various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A Confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predictions made by a classification model, comparing them against the actual classes.

In the given context, the authors discuss the preprocessing steps for environmental data, including data filtering, data curation, and data scaling. Data filtering involves selecting relevant environmental data for ecological processes. Data curation refers to the preparation and management of the data, while data scaling is the final step that includes gap filling and data matching levels required by the user. These scaling processes are implemented sequentially within GEE during data extraction.

However, the text does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps applied after the model training. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer this query accurately.
