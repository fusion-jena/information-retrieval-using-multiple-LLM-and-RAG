Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in this particular research involves the analysis of large-scale acoustic data, specifically, urban audio environments (AE). Therefore, the primary data format used in this pipeline is audio.

The audio recordings are initially processed to retrieve information about the frequency spectrum. This is achieved by calculating a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for all recordings, sorting the values into 1024 equally sized bins, and averaging the values energetically inside each bin. The frequencies are then aligned by a log-transformation, focusing on the frequency range from 0 to 13 kHz.

However, the context does not mention the use of other data formats such as images, videos, or CSV files in the deep learning pipeline. The pipeline primarily revolves around processing and analyzing audio data to understand the urban AE better. 

Therefore, the answer to the query is: The primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio. Other data formats like images, videos, or CSV files are not mentioned in the context.
