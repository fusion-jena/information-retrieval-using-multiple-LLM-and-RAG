Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on the data preprocessing methods, feature learning, and classification performance of different models for classifying bird sounds.

However, we can make some educated guesses about the general steps that might have been taken based on common practices in deep learning model deployment.



While the context does not provide specific details about the deployment of the trained deep learning model, it is reasonable to assume that the following general steps were taken:

1. Model serialization: After training the deep learning model, the model architecture and learned parameters were saved to a file, often referred to as model serialization. This allows the trained model to be easily loaded and used for making predictions on new data.

2. Platform selection: Depending on the intended use case, the trained model would need to be deployed on an appropriate platform. For example, if the model is to be used for real-time bird sound classification on a mobile device, then the model would need to be optimized and deployed on a mobile-friendly platform. On the other hand, if the model is to be used for offline analysis of audio recordings, then a more powerful server or cloud-based platform could be used.

3. Model integration: Once the model is deployed on the chosen platform, it would need to be integrated with the application or system that will be using it for making predictions. This might involve writing code to load the serialized model, prepare input data, and call the model to make predictions.

4. Model evaluation and monitoring: After deployment, it is important to evaluate the performance of the model on new data and monitor its behavior over time. This can help identify any issues or degradation in performance and inform the need for model retraining or optimization.

It is important to note that these are general steps that are commonly taken in deep learning model deployment, but the specific details may vary depending on the use case and platform.
