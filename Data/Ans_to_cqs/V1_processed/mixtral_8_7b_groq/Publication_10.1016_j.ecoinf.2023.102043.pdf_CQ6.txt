The text provided does not directly discuss the preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does describe the preprocessing steps taken before using a specific deep learning model, YAMNet, for goat vocalization detection.

The preprocessing steps for the YAMNet model involve:

1. Converting the audio to a monophonic channel and resampling it at 16 kHz.
2. Extracting the spectrogram using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) magnitudes of 25 ms, overlapped by 15 ms.
3. Calculating the Mel spectrogram by mapping to 64 bins of the Mel scale within the range of 125â€“7500 Hz.

These steps are specific to audio data and are used to extract meaningful features from the audio signals, which are then used as input to the YAMNet model.

Therefore, while the text does not discuss general preprocessing steps for deep learning models, it does provide insight into the preprocessing steps required for a specific deep learning model, YAMNet, when used for audio signal processing.
