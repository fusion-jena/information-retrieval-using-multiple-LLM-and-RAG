Based on the provided context, the NASaWebServiceAPIProvider class of the nasawebservice package exposes methods for accessing NASA's web service, including methods for executing requests for specific products, bands, dates, and subsets. The execute\_many() method is used to avoid a limitation of a maximum of ten dates per request.

However, the context does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline of the NASA web service. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query "What optimization techniques are applied in the deep learning pipeline (e.g., SGD, Adam)?" based on the given context.
