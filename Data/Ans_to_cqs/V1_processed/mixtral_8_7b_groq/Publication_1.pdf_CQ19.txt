The provided context does not give specific information about which deep learning frameworks are used in the biodiversity monitoring application. However, it is mentioned that the deep learning model is built using a trainable computational model composed of a stack of processing layers. Deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras provide the necessary tools to build and train such models. TensorFlow, developed by Google Brain, is a popular open-source library for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning. PyTorch, developed by Facebook's AI Research lab, is another open-source machine learning library that provides maximum flexibility and speed. Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.

Considering the availability of large amounts of labeled data produced by analysts using the UI, and the need for big data infrastructure, it is likely that one of these popular deep learning frameworks is used to build the deep learning model for biodiversity monitoring. However, the specific framework used is not mentioned in the provided context.
