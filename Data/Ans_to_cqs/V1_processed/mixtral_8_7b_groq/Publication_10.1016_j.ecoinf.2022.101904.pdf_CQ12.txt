The deep learning models used in the pipeline mentioned in the provided context are Transformers, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).

The Transformer model is used in the Vision Transformer (ViT) and Swin Transformer. These models are used for wetland classification, as shown in Figure 8. The Transformer model utilizes an attention-based approach, which allows it to acquire global contextual knowledge through self-attention. This results in better generalization capability compared to CNN algorithms.

CNNs are used in the CoAtNet model and a custom CNN + ST (Swin Transformer) model. These models are also used for wetland classification. CNNs are known for their ability to extract local features from images, making them suitable for image classification tasks.

GANs are used in the 3DUNetGSFormer model, which is a deep learning pipeline for complex wetland mapping. GANs are a class of models that consist of two components, a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates new data instances, while the discriminator evaluates them for authenticity. GANs are often used for image generation and have been used in this pipeline for complex wetland mapping.

In summary, the deep learning models used in the pipeline are Transformers (Vision Transformer and Swin Transformer), CNNs (CoAtNet and CNN + ST), and GANs (3DUNetGSFormer). Each of these models has its strengths and is used for different tasks in the pipeline, such as wetland classification and complex wetland mapping.
