The text provided does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model after training. However, it does mention that the deep learning model used in this study is a GRU-DNN model, which is a combination of Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and a Regular Neural Network (DNN). The GRU layer is preceded by an input layer and followed by a fully connected layer, from which the predicted values can be produced.

The text also mentions that the proposed work uses a dataset from the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency and that the data is preprocessed and fine-tuned before being used for model training. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model is serialized or deployed on a platform for real-world use.

Therefore, while the text provides details on the data collection, preprocessing, and model training stages, it does not provide information on the deployment of the trained deep learning model.
