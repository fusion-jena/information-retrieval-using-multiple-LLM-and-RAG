The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of validation accuracy metrics, specifically the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE). These metrics are calculated between the measured and predicted Trophic State Index (TSI) values. The RMSE is determined using Equation 6, which takes the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the measured and predicted TSI values, divided by the number of samples, and then takes the square root of that value.

The model being trained is a three-layer backpropagation artificial neural network implemented in MATLAB R2014b. The input layer corresponds to the aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) values, while the intermediate and output layers each consist of a single neuron that corresponds to the TSI predictor. The maximum training times are set to 10,000 and the training error is set to 0.001.

The model is trained using 64 water samples for calibration, with the remaining samples used for validation. The validation accuracy is then assessed by calculating the R2 and RMSE between the measured and predicted TSI values for the validation samples.

This strategy allows for the monitoring of the model's performance during training by evaluating how well the model is able to predict the TSI values for the validation samples. By using both the R2 and RMSE metrics, the model's ability to accurately predict the TSI values and the magnitude of the errors in those predictions can be evaluated. This information can then be used to determine if the model is overfitting or underfitting the data and adjust the training parameters accordingly.
