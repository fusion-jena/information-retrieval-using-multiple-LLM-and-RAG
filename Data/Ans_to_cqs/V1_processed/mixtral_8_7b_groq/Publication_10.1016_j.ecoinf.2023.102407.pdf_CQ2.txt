Based on the provided context, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline in this particular study are CSV files. The context mentions the use of BIOCLIM variables, which are climate data variables used in species distribution modeling (SDM). These variables include different temperature and precipitation measures, all of which are continuous variables provided in the form of a CSV file.

Moreover, the context also mentions the use of a modeling package, which implies that the data is in a format that can be processed by the chosen package. In SDM, it is common to use presence-only or presence-absence data, which can be stored in a CSV file format.

However, the context does not mention any other data formats such as image, audio, or video. Therefore, it can be concluded that in this particular deep learning pipeline, the data format used is a CSV file containing climate variables used in species distribution modeling.

Another point worth noting is that the deep learning models mentioned in the context, such as GLM, GAM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, XGB, LGBM, ANN, and SDP-EPL, are all commonly used in species distribution modeling and are typically applied to tabular data, such as CSV files.

In summary, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context is a CSV file containing climate variables used in species distribution modeling.
