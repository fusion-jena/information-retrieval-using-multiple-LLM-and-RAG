The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models include batch size, learning rate, number of epochs, and input image size. Specifically, for the Inception-V3 model, the batch size is 48, the learning rate is 0.05, the number of epochs is 75, and the input image size is 299x299. For the MobileNet-V2 model, the batch size is 32, the learning rate is 0.01, the number of epochs is 100, and the input image size is 224x224. For the ResNet-18 model, the batch size is also 32, the learning rate is 0.005, the number of epochs is 150, and the input image size is 224x224. Lastly, for the DenseNet-121 model, the batch size is 16, the learning rate is 0.001, the number of epochs is 100, and the input image size is 224x224.

In addition, the optimizer used for all four models is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The models were initially trained by freezing the feature extraction layers and training the classification layers only. However, better results were obtained when both feature extraction and classifier layers of each architecture were configured to be trainable.

It is worth noting that these hyperparameters were obtained using grid search, and the models were implemented using Keras. The resulting hyperparameters for each model are shown in Table II of the provided context.
