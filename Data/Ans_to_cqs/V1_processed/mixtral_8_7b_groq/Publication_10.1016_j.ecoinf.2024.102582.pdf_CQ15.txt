Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam used in the deep learning pipeline for individual tree crown delineation in mangrove forests (Lassalle et al., 2022). However, it is mentioned that the random forest algorithm was applied for rapid land use type classification.

The study by Lassalle et al. (2022) primarily focuses on the development of a deep learning-based approach for individual tree crown delineation in mangrove forests using very-high-resolution satellite imagery. The study discusses the limitations of data sources and classification methods, and suggests the use of improved image resolution and machine learning approaches for accurate identification of mangrove species. However, the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not discussed.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
