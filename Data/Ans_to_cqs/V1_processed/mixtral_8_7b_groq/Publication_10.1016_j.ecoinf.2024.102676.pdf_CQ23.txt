The text provided does not give specific details about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was trained on images of all qualities, which suggests an attempt to use a diverse dataset. It is also possible that other techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were used, but this information is not provided in the context.

In addition, the authors mention that they used data preprocessing techniques such as omitting missing values and mean imputation. These techniques can help improve the quality of the data and reduce bias, which can in turn help improve the generalizability of the model.

Furthermore, the authors also mention that they used a control group consisting of unmodified datasets of each species, as well as a control group defined as the geometric profile extracted by an experienced operator. These control groups could have been used to evaluate the performance of the model and ensure that it is generalizable to new data.

Overall, while the text does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it does suggest that the authors took steps to use a diverse dataset, improve the quality of the data, and evaluate the performance of the model.
