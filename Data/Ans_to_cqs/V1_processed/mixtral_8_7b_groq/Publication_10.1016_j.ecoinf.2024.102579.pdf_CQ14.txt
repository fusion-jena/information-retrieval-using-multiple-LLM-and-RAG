Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses various forest diversity indices, their equations, and their estimation methods. However, it does not mention any specific techniques for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search.

The closest related information is the use of the number of nearest neighbors (k) as a parameter for some diversity indices. The text states that diversity indices were estimated for k = 1 and k = 4 nearest neighbors. However, this is not an optimization technique for model hyperparameters.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query regarding the optimization of model hyperparameters.
