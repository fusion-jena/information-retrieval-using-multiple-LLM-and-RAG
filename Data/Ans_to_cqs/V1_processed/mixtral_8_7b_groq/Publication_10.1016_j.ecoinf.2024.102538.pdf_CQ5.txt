The provided context discusses four datasets used in bird sound recognition, which is a specific application of deep learning. These datasets are BirdCLEF2018-Small (BC-S), BirdCLEF2018-Large (BC-L), Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata (LS), and Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata (LS*).

1. BirdCLEF2018-Small (BC-S) and BirdCLEF2018-Large (BC-L): These datasets were released in 2018 for the BirdCLEF competition. The competition focuses on bird sound recognition, and the datasets contain bird sound recordings from Europe and America. BC-S has 3,118 training, 308 validation, and 308 test sounds, categorized into 14 coarse, 42 medium, and 122 fine categories. BC-L has 10,216 training, 1,005 validation, and 1,005 test sounds, categorized into 22 coarse, 57 medium, and 309 fine categories.

2. Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata (LS): This dataset was recorded in China and contains 20,512 training, 2,514 validation, and 2,513 test sounds. The sounds are categorized into 13 coarse, 47 medium, and 100 fine categories.

3. Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata (LS*): This dataset is a modified version of LS, with the same number of sounds and categories. However, the context does not provide information on the specific modifications made to this dataset.

These datasets are used for bird sound recognition, and deep learning models like Xception networks with positional attention mechanisms are employed for this task. These models are trained on mel-scale spectrograms derived from the sound amplitude data.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in the context of bird sound recognition uses the following datasets: BirdCLEF2018-Small (BC-S), BirdCLEF2018-Large (BC-L), Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata (LS), and Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata (LS*).
