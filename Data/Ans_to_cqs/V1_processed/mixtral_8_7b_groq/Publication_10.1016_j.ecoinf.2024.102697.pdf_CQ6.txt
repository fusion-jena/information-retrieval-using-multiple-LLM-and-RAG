Based on the provided context, there is no mention of deep learning models being used in the study. The study primarily focuses on machine learning models, specifically the random forest method. Therefore, I cannot provide information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model based on this context.

However, I can provide some general insights on preprocessing steps for machine learning models, which might include:

1. Data cleaning: This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistent data.
2. Normalization or scaling: This process adjusts the range of features to ensure that all features contribute proportionately to the model. Normalization typically scales features to a range of [0, 1], while scaling can involve other ranges, such as [-1, 1] or standardization to a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
3. Feature engineering or selection: This step involves selecting relevant features for the model, which can help minimize training costs, measurement requirements, and decrease the likelihood of overfitting.

In the context of the study, it appears that the primary preprocessing steps involve k-fold cross-validation for training and testing the machine learning models. This process includes an initial division of the data into holdout data and data for model development, followed by an inner 5 k-fold cross-validation to minimize the bias caused by tuning of hyperparameters on training results. The training performance is calculated based on the inner cross-validated ensemble, while the testing performance is determined by selecting the optimal set of hyperparameters from the entire training set to predict on the holdout data. This process is repeated 15 times for each unique model to reduce potential bias and variance related to random sampling.
