The hyperparameters of the model are not explicitly stated to be optimized using methods such as grid search or random search in the provided context. The hyperparameters such as k, the number of dimensions in the embedding space, are set to preselected values due to computational reasons. Specifically, the embedding size k is set to 128 for data sets with 200 taxa and 512 for larger data sets. Other hyperparameters are fixed to their defaults unless otherwise specified.

However, the text suggests that it is possible to fine-tune all the hyperparameters using a validation set in practice. This process involves randomly selecting a subset of the reference species as the validation set, using these as testing data to tune the parameters for the given data set, and then training one last time with all the data with the fine-tuned parameters. This procedure requires repeated training and can be slow, and the preliminary results show that the gain in accuracy obtained can be small.

Therefore, while the hyperparameters are not explicitly optimized using methods such as grid search or random search, there is a suggested approach for fine-tuning the hyperparameters using a validation set in practice.
