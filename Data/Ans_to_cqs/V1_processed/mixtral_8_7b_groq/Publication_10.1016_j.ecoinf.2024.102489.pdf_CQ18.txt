The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation in a grid search method (GridSearchCV) to search for the optimal parameters of the Random Forest (RF) model. This approach allows for an evaluation of the model's performance at various stages of the training process, thus ensuring that the model is not overfitting or underfitting the data.

The OOB error is an estimate of the generalization error that is calculated by averaging the errors of each tree in the RF model on the samples that were not used in the construction of that tree. This provides an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on new data, allowing for an assessment of the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

In addition to the OOB error, five-fold cross-validation is used to further evaluate the model's performance. Cross-validation involves dividing the training data into k folds, where k is typically set to 5. The model is then trained on k-1 folds and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, with each fold serving as the test set once. The average performance across all k folds is then used as an estimate of the model's performance.

The grid search method (GridSearchCV) is used to search for the optimal parameters of the RF model. This involves specifying a range of possible values for each parameter, and then training the model with all possible combinations of these values. The combination of parameters that results in the lowest OOB error and cross-validation error is then selected as the optimal set of parameters.

In this study, the parameters of the RF model, including the number of trees (n\_estimators), minimum number of leaves (minleaf), and number of randomly selected node-split feature variables (max\_features), were found to significantly affect the accuracy and complexity of the model. The grid search method was used to search for the optimal values of these parameters, with n\_estimators ranging from 100 to 1000 in intervals of 50, minleaf ranging from 2 to 50, and max\_features ranging from 1 to k, where k is the number of characteristic variables.

Overall, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of OOB error, five-fold cross-validation, and grid search method to search for the optimal parameters of the RF model. This allows for an evaluation of the model's performance at various stages of the training process, ensuring that the model is not overfitting or underfitting the data.
