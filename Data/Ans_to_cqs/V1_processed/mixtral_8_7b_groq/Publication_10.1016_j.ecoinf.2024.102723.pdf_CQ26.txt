Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of stratified sampling during the splitting of the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.

Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that aims to ensure that the sample is representative of the population with respect to certain characteristics. In this case, the dataset is stratified based on year (2008-2010) and location (19 different stations) to ensure that the training, validation, and test sets have a similar distribution of these characteristics as the original dataset. This can help to prevent bias in the model's performance that might arise if the distribution of these characteristics in the training, validation, and test sets were significantly different from that in the original dataset.

Other techniques that can be used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Oversampling is a technique used to increase the representation of a minority class in a dataset by replicating instances of that class. This can help to prevent bias in the model's performance that might arise if the minority class is underrepresented in the training data.

Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the representation of a majority class in a dataset by removing instances of that class. This can help to prevent bias in the model's performance that might arise if the majority class is overrepresented in the training data.

Diverse data collection is a technique used to ensure that the dataset includes a wide range of examples that are representative of the population. This can help to prevent bias in the model's performance that might arise if the dataset is not representative of the population.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, it does mention the use of stratified sampling during the splitting of the dataset. Other techniques that can be used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
