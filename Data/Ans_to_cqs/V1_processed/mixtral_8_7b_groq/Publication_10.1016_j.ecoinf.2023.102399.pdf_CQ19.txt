The context provided does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) was used to build the improved YOLO model for fish biomass estimation. However, it is mentioned that the model is based on a deep neural network. Therefore, it can be inferred that one of the popular deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, was likely used to build the model. To get the exact information, it would be necessary to refer to the original research article or contact the authors.
