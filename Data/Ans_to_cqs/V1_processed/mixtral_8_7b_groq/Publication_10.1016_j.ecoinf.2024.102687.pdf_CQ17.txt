The provided context does not directly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the fine-tuning of a pretrained DenseNet, which can be used in conjunction with regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.

Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models by adding a penalty term to the loss function. This penalty term discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data that may not generalize well to new, unseen data.

Two common regularization methods are dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are "dropped out" or ignored during training. This helps to prevent over-reliance on any single neuron and encourages the model to learn more robust features. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which can help to prevent overfitting.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these regularization techniques, it is possible that they were used during the fine-tuning of the pretrained DenseNet. The fine-tuning process involves adjusting the pretrained model's weights to better fit the specific task and dataset at hand. Regularization techniques can be used during this fine-tuning process to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of Prototypical Networks (PN) during fine-tuning. Prototypical Networks are a type of few-shot learning algorithm that can be used for clustering tasks. While not a regularization technique itself, Prototypical Networks can help to prevent overfitting by limiting the number of trainable parameters in the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, it is possible that techniques such as dropout and L2 regularization were used during the fine-tuning of the pretrained DenseNet. Additionally, the use of Prototypical Networks can help to prevent overfitting by limiting the number of trainable parameters in the model.
