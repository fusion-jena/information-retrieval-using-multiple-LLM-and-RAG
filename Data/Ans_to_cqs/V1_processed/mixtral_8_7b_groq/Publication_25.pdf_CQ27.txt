The text provided does not give detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model is retrained based on a small number of hand-annotated trees to create the full model. This implies that the model was trained on a larger dataset generated through unsupervised methods and then fine-tuned using a smaller, manually annotated dataset.

In terms of model serialization, the text does not provide specific details. Model serialization is the process of saving the state of a trained model so that it can be loaded and used later. This is a common practice in deep learning to ensure that trained models can be easily shared and deployed.

As for platform selection, the text does not provide any information. Platform selection refers to choosing the hardware and software environment where the deep learning model will be deployed. This could range from a local machine to a cloud-based platform, depending on the requirements of the application.

In summary, while the text provides some insights into the training process of the deep learning model, it does not give specific details on model serialization and platform selection. These are important steps in the deployment of a deep learning model and would typically be specified in a complete description of the model deployment process.
