The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it does mention that five training datasets were built and five CNN models were trained on these datasets. It can be inferred that the data was likely split into training and validation sets during the training phase, and possibly a separate test set was used for the validation phase.

In general, it is common practice in deep learning to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and test. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model.

The context also mentions the use of data augmentation, which can be used to increase the size of the training set and reduce overfitting. Techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping can be used to generate additional training examples from the existing data.

In the case of the study described in the context, it appears that the training datasets were created by compiling a global database of high-resolution satellite and aerial RGB images from two sources. The images were then labeled with different levels of tree cover and the "Non-Forest" class. It is possible that the data was split into training and validation sets during the construction of these datasets.

Overall, while the context does not provide specific details on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it can be inferred that standard practices such as training, validation, and test sets were likely used.
