The text provided does not contain a direct answer to the question about techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of deep learning algorithms in strategic planning and in the exploration of influencing factors of land use and agricultural systems. Therefore, it is likely that the techniques used to address data bias in deep learning, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, would also be applicable in these contexts.

Stratified splitting is a technique used to ensure that each subset of the data (e.g., training, validation, testing) contains a representative sample of the overall data. This can help to prevent bias that may arise from an unrepresentative sample.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to address class imbalance in the data. Class imbalance occurs when one class (e.g., positive class) has significantly fewer instances than another class (e.g., negative class). Oversampling involves creating more instances of the minority class, while undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class. Both techniques can help to improve the performance of deep learning algorithms by ensuring that the model is trained on a more balanced dataset.

Diverse data collection is a technique used to ensure that the data used to train deep learning algorithms is representative of the population or phenomenon being studied. This can help to prevent bias that may arise from using a dataset that is not representative of the population or phenomenon.

It is important to note that these techniques are not exhaustive and other techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) can also be used to address data bias during preprocessing of deep learning pipeline.
