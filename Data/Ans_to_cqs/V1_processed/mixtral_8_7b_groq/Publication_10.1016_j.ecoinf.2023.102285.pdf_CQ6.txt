Based on the provided document, it is not possible to explicitly list the preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. However, the document does mention some data processing techniques that were applied.

Firstly, the document discusses a methodology for classification of man-made underwater objects in optical and SAS data. The datasets used for building and testing this methodology are explored in Section 3 of the document. Therefore, it can be inferred that some form of data cleaning and preparation was carried out on these datasets.

Secondly, the document mentions the use of a database from APEM, and an experimental design of data utilization and processing with targeted objectives is outlined in Table 3. This suggests that some preprocessing steps, such as data cleaning, normalization, or scaling, may have been applied to the APEM database.

Thirdly, the document discusses the development of algorithms for man-made object detection with an overall computational complexity of O(n log n). While the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned, it is likely that some form of image processing was carried out on the input images before feeding them into the deep learning model.

Therefore, while the specific preprocessing steps are not detailed in the document, it is clear that some form of data cleaning, preparation, and processing was carried out on the datasets used in the study.
