Based on the provided context, the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are not mentioned. The text discusses the use of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in the context of spatial predictions and cross-validation, but it does not specify these as metrics for evaluating a deep learning model.

However, it is important to note that the choice of evaluation metric for a deep learning model depends on the specific problem and the nature of the data. Commonly used metrics for evaluating deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.

In the context of the study described, where the goal is to predict total soil nitrogen and phosphorus (TSN and TSP) under various physiographic positions, it is likely that the model's performance was evaluated using metrics that are appropriate for regression problems, such as MSE, RMSE, or R-squared.

Therefore, while the specific metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model are not mentioned in the provided context, it is important to choose appropriate metrics based on the specific problem and the nature of the data.
