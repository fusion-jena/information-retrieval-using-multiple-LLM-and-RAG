Based on the provided context, there is no information that directly answers the query about which deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) are used to build the model. The text focuses on the overall workflow and methods used for processing and analyzing vessel data for fishing pressure estimation. It does not mention any specific deep learning frameworks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
