The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, as described in the given context, involves dividing the data into training and testing sets. However, there is no explicit mention of a validation set.

The training set consisted of 21 different individuals (classes), each having 4 different 320 Ã— 320 pixels images. This resulted in a total of 84 images for training. On the other hand, the test size included 99 other labeled images of the individuals that appeared in the training set.

The train-test split was designed such that the test set included images of the individuals that appeared in the training set. This allowed for the testing of the model's ability to generalize to images of individuals it had seen during training.

It is important to note that there was no mention of a validation set. A validation set is typically used during the training process to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data. This can help prevent overfitting and ensure that the model is able to generalize well to new data.

In summary, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this context involved dividing the data into a training set of 84 images and a test set of 99 images. However, there was no mention of a validation set, which is typically used during the training process to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
