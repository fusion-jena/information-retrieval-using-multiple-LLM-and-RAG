The provided context discusses imputation methods for handling missing data, specifically focusing on tree-based nonparametric imputation techniques like missForest, missRanger, and MICE RF. However, it does not directly address the question about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

Deep learning models often incorporate randomness during different stages of the training process, such as:

1. Initialization of model parameters: Model weights and biases are typically initialized with random values.
2. Data shuffling and splitting: Training, validation, and test datasets are often randomly split from the original dataset. Moreover, data samples are randomly shuffled during each training epoch.
3. Dropout: A regularization technique that randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent overfitting.
4. Batch normalization: Scaling and shifting the activations of the previous layer using running estimates of the mean and variance, which are randomly initialized at the beginning of training.

Strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines include:

1. **Setting a random seed value**: By fixing the random seed value, the randomness can be controlled, and the same sequence of random numbers will be generated across multiple runs. This ensures reproducibility of the results.
2. **Cross-validation**: Performing k-fold cross-validation to train and test the model on different subsets of the data, reducing the impact of randomness on the final performance metric.
3. **Ensemble methods**: Training multiple models with different random initializations and combining their predictions to improve generalization and reduce the impact of individual random events.

In summary, the provided context does not discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. However, deep learning models incorporate randomness during various stages of the training process. Strategies for handling randomness include setting a random seed value, cross-validation, and ensemble methods.
