The provided context does not give detailed information on the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the U-Net model was trained using both training and validation data, and that the availability of labeling data is crucial for U-Net model applications.

The context also describes the process of generating training data for the Probabilistic Change Framework (PCF) using satellite imagery. This process involved creating grid cells with a resolution of 2560 m in South Korea, and extracting results to prepare input data for model training. The sub-class land-cover map of South Korea was then transformed into a macro-class land-cover map by converting all sub-class items into macro-class items.

Therefore, it can be inferred that after training the deep learning model, the next step would be to serialize the model so that it can be deployed on a platform for real-world application. Model serialization involves saving the model architecture and weights in a format that can be loaded and used for making predictions.

The choice of platform for deploying the model would depend on the specific requirements of the application. For example, if the application involves real-time processing of satellite imagery, a cloud-based platform with GPU acceleration may be suitable. On the other hand, if the application involves batch processing of large volumes of data, a local server or HPC cluster may be more appropriate.

Overall, while the context does not provide specific details on the process of deploying the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the general process would involve model serialization and platform selection based on the specific requirements of the application.
