Based on the provided context, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, called MIGRATE\_ELM, involves the use of an innovative Deep Learning algorithm (DELE) and a Geo Location Country Based Service for assigning the class 'native' or 'invasive' to marine species. However, the text does not explicitly mention the steps taken for model serialization or platform selection.

Model serialization refers to the process of saving the trained model into a file that can be later loaded and used for making predictions. Common formats for model serialization include JSON, XML, or specific formats provided by deep learning frameworks like HDF5 or Tensorflowâ€™s SavedModel. The context does not provide information on whether the MIGRATE\_ELM model was serialized and, if so, in which format.

Platform selection refers to choosing the hardware and software environment where the model will be deployed. This could be a local machine, a cluster, or a cloud-based platform like Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure. The context does not provide information on where the MIGRATE\_ELM model was deployed or on which hardware it runs.

Nonetheless, the text does mention that the MIGRATE\_ELM model is applied for marine species identification in the context of biosecurity. This implies that the model is used to analyze big data related to marine species, and it is expected to perform well in terms of generalization, training time, and parameter determination, as stated in the advantages of ELMs.

In summary, while the context provides information on the development of the MIGRATE\_ELM model and its innovative features, it does not explicitly mention the processes of model serialization and platform selection.
