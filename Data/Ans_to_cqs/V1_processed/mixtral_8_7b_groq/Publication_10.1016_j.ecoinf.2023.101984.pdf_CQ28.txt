Based on the provided context, there is no information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. The context includes several academic papers about ecological informatics and biogeography, as well as a list of geographic layers, but it does not mention any cloud platforms or model deployment details. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
