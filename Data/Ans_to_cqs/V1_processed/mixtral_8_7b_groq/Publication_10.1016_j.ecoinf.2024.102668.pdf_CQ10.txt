The provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The CRediT authorship contribution statement mentions the contributions of the authors related to the conceptualization, investigation, methodology, software, validation, and writing of the original draft. However, it does not specify the link to the code repository where the pipeline can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.

It is worth mentioning that open-science practices encourage the sharing of code and data to promote transparency and reproducibility. In this study, the authors have followed the open-access publishing model by publishing the article under the CCBY-NC license. However, they have not provided information about the code repository used in the study.

An interested reader could contact the authors and request access to the code repository. The corresponding author, Jos´e D. L´opez, is mentioned in the paper, and their contact information could be used to initiate the conversation. Additionally, the authors could consider sharing the code repository in the future to promote open science and reproducibility of their research.
