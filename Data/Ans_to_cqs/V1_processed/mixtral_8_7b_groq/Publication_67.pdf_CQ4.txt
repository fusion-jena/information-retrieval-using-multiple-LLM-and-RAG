The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as described in the given context, include changes in brightness, half-random rotation, random rotation, random cropping, and random scaling of image size. 

First, a 50% increase in brightness was applied to the original samples. This technique helps the model to generalize better by making it invariant to changes in lighting conditions. 

Second, a half-random rotation was used. This means that the image was rotated randomly by an angle between 0 and 180 degrees. This technique helps the model to learn features that are invariant to orientation.

Third, random rotation with a factor randomly selected between 0° and 359° was applied. This technique further increases the variability of the training data by allowing for a wider range of rotation angles.

Fourth, random cropping was used. This technique involves selecting a random portion of the image and discarding the rest. This helps the model to learn features that are important regardless of their location in the image.

Finally, random scaling of image size was applied. This technique involves changing the size of the image by a random factor. This helps the model to learn features that are invariant to changes in distance or perspective.

These techniques were used to artificially increase the number of samples and preserve their labels, resulting in samples that are slightly different from the original ones. This approach helps to improve the performance of the CNN-based models by reducing the requirement of a large dataset for model training.
