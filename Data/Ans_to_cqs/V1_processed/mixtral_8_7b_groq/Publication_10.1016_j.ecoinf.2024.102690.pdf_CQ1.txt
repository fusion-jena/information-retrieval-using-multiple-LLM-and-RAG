The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Ecological Service Bundles (ESBs) and Ecological Service Values (ESVs) in the study. ESBs are research units allocated into different bundles based on spatial similarities using the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) neural network approach. ESVs are then used to establish three scenarios for product supply, water conservation, and habitat maintenance.

The context also mentions the use of hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord G*i) to analyze the spatial clustering of ESV and identify hotspot areas as optional ecological sources. Additionally, the study considers ecological leisure corridors, species migration corridors, and river runoff corridors in Scenario C.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the raw data used in this study likely includes spatial data related to land use, ecological services, and corridors. The sources of this data could include surveys, remote sensing data from satellites or sensors, and/or public datasets related to land use and ecological services. However, the specific methods used for collecting raw data are not provided in the context.
