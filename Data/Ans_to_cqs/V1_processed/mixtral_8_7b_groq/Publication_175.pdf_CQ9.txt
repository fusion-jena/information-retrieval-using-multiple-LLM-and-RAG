I regret to inform you that the context provided does not contain information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on discussing the challenge of working with limited data in the field of computer vision, specifically for image classification tasks with few images per class. It presents two approaches to tackle this problem: data augmentation and few-shots learning algorithms.

Data augmentation involves manipulating the existing data to create new samples, while few-shots learning focuses on designing classification algorithms that can learn from a few examples. However, the context does not mention any specific data repository or dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to your query based on the given information. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
