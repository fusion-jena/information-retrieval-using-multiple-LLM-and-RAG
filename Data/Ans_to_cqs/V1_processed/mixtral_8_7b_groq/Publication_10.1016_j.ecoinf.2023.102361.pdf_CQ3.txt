The text provided does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the potential for automatic annotation of data using the proposed approach.

One possible data annotation technique that could be used in this context is image classification, where each image in the dataset is assigned to a specific class or category. This is suggested by the mention of achieving better classification accuracy and the use of VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet-50 models, which are commonly used for image classification tasks.

Another possible data annotation technique is object detection, where bounding boxes are drawn around objects of interest in an image. This technique could be useful for annotating images in the weed dataset, as it would allow for the identification and location of specific types of weeds within an image.

Additionally, instance segmentation could be used as a data annotation technique. This is a more fine-grained approach than object detection, as it involves segmenting each instance of an object in an image and labeling it separately. This could be useful for the weed dataset if the goal is to identify and differentiate between individual weeds that may be in close proximity to each other.

Overall, while the text provided does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest the potential for automatic annotation and the use of image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation as possible techniques.
