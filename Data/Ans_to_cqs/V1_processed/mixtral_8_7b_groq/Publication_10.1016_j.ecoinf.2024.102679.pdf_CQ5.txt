The provided context does not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for processing aerial survey images in wildlife population estimation. However, it mentions that deep learning (DL) has been widely employed for (semi-)automating the detection and counting of various practices in remotely sensed imagery. Commonly used datasets in deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet, are not specified in the context.

The context does mention the use of a specific deep learning architecture, HerdNet, for processing aerial survey images in the context of an African savanna wildlife survey. However, it does not provide information on the dataset used to train or test the HerdNet model.

In summary, the provided context does not contain specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for processing aerial survey images in wildlife population estimation.
