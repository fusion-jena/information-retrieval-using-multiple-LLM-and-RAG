Based on the provided context, there are no specific mentions of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some of the sources do discuss data augmentation, which can help reduce bias in some cases. Data augmentation involves creating new synthetic data from existing data through various transformations, such as rotation, scaling, or flipping. This can help increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting.

Source 34 discusses environmental sound classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and mentions data augmentation as a method to improve model performance. Specifically, the authors used time stretching and pitch shifting to create new audio samples.

Source 35 also presents a study on environmental sound classification using deep convolutional neural networks and data augmentation. The authors used time stretching and pitch shifting, as well as adding background noise, to create new audio samples.

Source 36, "CNN Architectures for Large-Scale Audio Classification," discusses data augmentation strategies for audio data, including time stretching, pitch shifting, and adding background noise.

Source 37, "Deep neural networks for acoustic modeling in speech recognition," mentions data augmentation as a method to improve model performance and robustness.

In summary, while the provided context does not specifically mention techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling for addressing data bias during preprocessing, some sources do discuss data augmentation as a method to increase data diversity and reduce overfitting. Data augmentation techniques mentioned include time stretching, pitch shifting, and adding background noise.
