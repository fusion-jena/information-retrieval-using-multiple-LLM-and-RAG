Based on the provided context, the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for landslide susceptibility modeling (LSM) are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is clear that various data sources are used in LSM, including remote sensing and geospatial technologies.

Remote sensing technologies, such as satellite and airborne sensors, are commonly used to collect data for LSM. These sensors can capture various types of data, such as optical, radar, and lidar data, which can be used to extract information about the terrain, land cover, soil, lithology, and other factors that influence landslide susceptibility. For instance, the context mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN), which are deep learning models that are commonly used for image analysis and can be applied to remote sensing data.

Public datasets are also used in LSM, as mentioned in the context. These datasets can include various types of information, such as topographic data, geological maps, land cover maps, and historical landslide inventory data. For example, the context mentions the use of data-driven LSM techniques, such as weights-of-evidence, frequency ratio, weighted overlay, analytical hierarchy process, and evidential belief function, which likely rely on public datasets.

While the context does not explicitly mention surveys as a method for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for LSM, they could be used to collect information that is not available through remote sensing or public datasets. Surveys could be used to collect information about the properties of the soil, the presence of groundwater, or the degree of anthropogenic activity in the area, among other factors.

In summary, while the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for LSM are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is clear that remote sensing and geospatial technologies, public datasets, and potentially surveys are used to collect the necessary data.
