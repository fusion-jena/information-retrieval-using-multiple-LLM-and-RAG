The provided context does not give specific information about the frameworks used to build the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of the twarc2 library to handle the data in JSON format returned by the Twitter API. This library simplifies the handling of the quota limits imposed by the Twitter API and the pagination resulting from a single query. It does not necessarily mean that twarc2 was used to build the deep learning model, but it was used to handle the data. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given context.
