In the context provided, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training involves dividing the labeled pixels of the UAV hyperspectral image into a training set and a test set. This is done with a ratio of 1:9, meaning that for every 10 labeled pixels, 1 is used for training and 9 are used for testing. The training samples are used to learn the weights and biases of the network, while the test samples are used to evaluate the classification performance. However, there is no mention of a validation set in the provided context. In some deep learning workflows, a validation set is used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model during the training process, helping to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. In this case, it appears that the model's performance is evaluated solely on the test set after training.
