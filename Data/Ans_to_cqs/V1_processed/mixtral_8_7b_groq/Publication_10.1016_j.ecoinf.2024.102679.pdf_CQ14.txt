The context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. There is no mention of methods such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization techniques. The text does mention that the pre-trained model underwent fine-tuning for four iterations, but it does not specify how the hyperparameters were adjusted during these iterations. The focus of the context seems to be more on the process of gathering samples and enhancing the model's performance for a specific region (SW stratum) rather than on the optimization of hyperparameters. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer this query.
