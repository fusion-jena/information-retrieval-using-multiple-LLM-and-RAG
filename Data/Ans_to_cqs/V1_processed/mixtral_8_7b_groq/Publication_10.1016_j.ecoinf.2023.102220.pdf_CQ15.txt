The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) blocks in the architecture, but it does not specify the optimization techniques utilized during the training of the model.

Optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and others are commonly used to minimize the loss function and update the weights in deep learning pipelines. However, the context does not mention any of these techniques explicitly.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to accurately answer the query about the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
