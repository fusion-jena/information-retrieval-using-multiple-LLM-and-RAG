The provided context does not contain information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text describes the methodology and data used in a case study for detecting damage in forests using deep learning and high-resolution orthophotos. However, it does not provide a link to the data repository where the deep learning pipeline or the used dataset can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
