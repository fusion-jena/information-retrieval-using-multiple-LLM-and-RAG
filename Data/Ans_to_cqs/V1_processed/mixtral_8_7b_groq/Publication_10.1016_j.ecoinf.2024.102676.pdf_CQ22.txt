Based on the provided context, the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are not explicitly stated. The text mentions the use of a final rank-based performance evaluation metric, which is an average of the rankings for both the BCR (Balanced Classification Rate) and DER (Detection Error Rate) for each species and fraction of missing landmarks. However, this metric seems to be a custom evaluation method used for comparing different methods and not a standard metric like accuracy, precision, or recall.

In the study design section, the authors mention the use of deep learning models for classifying three sympatric otter species. They compare a model trained on images of all qualities with a model trained only on high-quality prints. The comparison is based on the overall performance of the models, but the specific evaluation metric used for this comparison is not provided.

Given the context, it can be inferred that the study uses custom evaluation metrics (BCR and DER) and a final rank-based performance evaluation metric tailored for their specific study. The standard evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

 The provided context does not specify the standard evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) for assessing the performance of the deep learning model. Instead, custom evaluation metrics (BCR, DER, and a final rank-based performance evaluation metric) are used for comparing different methods in the study.
