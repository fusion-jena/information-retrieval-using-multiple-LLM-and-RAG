The provided context discusses various aspects of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their use in image classification, including the architectures of AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet. However, it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. 

However, based on general practices in deep learning, some common preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model can include:

1. **Data Normalization**: This involves scaling the input data to a similar range to avoid any feature dominating the others. In the context of images, this could mean normalizing pixel values to a range between 0 and 1.

2. **Data Augmentation**: This is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by creating modified versions of the images in the dataset. This can include operations like rotation, scaling, flipping, and cropping. Data augmentation can help improve the model's ability to generalize.

3. **Data Cleaning**: This involves removing any irrelevant or corrupted data from the dataset. In the context of images, this could mean removing images that are too dark, too bright, or otherwise unclear.

4. **One-Hot Encoding**: This is a process used to represent categorical data as binary vectors. In the context of image classification, this could mean converting labels into a format that the model can understand.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these steps, it does discuss the use of Batch Normalization (BN) in deep CNNs. BN is a technique used during the training process to standardize and normalize the inputs to each layer of the network. This can help speed up learning and improve the final performance of the model.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly answer the query, it does provide relevant information about the use of normalization in deep learning models.
