The provided context discusses the use of deep learning techniques for predicting landscape types in a case study area, but it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of image annotation was likely employed during the dataset construction phase.

In the context of computer vision and image recognition tasks, common data annotation techniques for deep learning include:

1. Image-level classification: This is the simplest form of annotation where each image is assigned to a single class or category. In the context of landscape prediction, an image might be annotated as 'forest', 'urban', 'agricultural', etc.

2. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a bounding box around objects of interest within an image. This can help the deep learning model to focus on specific regions of the image and improve object detection performance.

3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with a corresponding class or category. This can help the deep learning model to understand the spatial distribution of objects within an image and improve object localization performance.

4. Instance segmentation: This technique is an extension of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and assigned a unique identifier. This can help the deep learning model to distinguish between multiple instances of the same object within an image.

Given that the deep learning pipeline in the provided context involves image recognition tasks, it is likely that one or more of these data annotation techniques were used during the dataset construction phase. However, the specific techniques used are not mentioned in the provided context.
