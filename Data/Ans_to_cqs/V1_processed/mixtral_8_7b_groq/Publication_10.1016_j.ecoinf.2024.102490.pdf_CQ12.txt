Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating that a specific type of deep learning model, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers, is used in the pipeline. The context focuses on various machine learning techniques, including Maximum Entropy, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Generalized Additive Models (GAM), and others, but it does not mention any deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query based on the given context.
