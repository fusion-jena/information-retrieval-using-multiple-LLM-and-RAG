Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context focuses on an ecological informatics study about optimizing land use demand in 2030, including data resources and the improvement of the monitoring system for grassland restoration.

However, in machine learning and deep learning models, training is typically considered complete when the validation loss reaches a plateau or stops decreasing significantly. This indicates that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data and is unlikely to improve further by continuing the training process. Other criteria for determining training completion include early stopping to prevent overfitting and monitoring the performance on a separate test dataset.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific criteria for determining when training is complete, in machine learning and deep learning models, training is typically considered complete when the validation loss reaches a plateau or stops decreasing significantly.
