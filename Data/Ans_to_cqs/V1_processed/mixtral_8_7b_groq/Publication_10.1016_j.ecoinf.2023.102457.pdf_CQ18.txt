Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during the training phase of the BirdNET model. However, it is mentioned that the BirdNET model is a pre-trained model that has been trained on a large dataset consisting of sounds from various bird and non-bird species.

The model architecture of BirdNET is derived from the family of ResNets and consists of 157 layers with over 27 million parameters. The training process involved extensive data pre-processing, augmentation, and mixup. Therefore, it can be inferred that the developers would have implemented some monitoring strategy during the training phase to ensure the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

One possible monitoring strategy could be using validation data to evaluate the model's performance periodically during the training process. Validation data is a separate dataset that is not used for training but is used to evaluate the model's performance. By evaluating the model's performance on the validation data, the developers could monitor the model's performance and ensure that it is not overfitting to the training data.

Another possible monitoring strategy could be using early stopping, which is a technique used to prevent overfitting by stopping the training process when the model's performance on the validation data starts to degrade. This technique helps to ensure that the model's performance on unseen data is optimized.

In addition, the developers could have used learning rate scheduling, which is a technique used to adjust the learning rate during the training process. By adjusting the learning rate, the developers could ensure that the model converges to the optimal solution and prevent the model from getting stuck in a local minimum.

Overall, while there is no explicit information about the monitoring strategy used during the training phase of the BirdNET model, it can be inferred that the developers would have implemented some monitoring strategy to ensure the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
