Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model can include several steps such as text translation, data pre-processing, and word frequency counting.

Firstly, text translation is necessary if the text data is in multiple languages. In the context of hikers' perceptions, the text descriptions were translated into English using DeepL.

Secondly, data pre-processing involves using natural language processing (NLP) methods to perform automated text mining. This step consists of tokenization, lemmatization, and stop words removal. Tokenization is the process of breaking down the text into individual words or tokens. Lemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base or dictionary form. Stop words removal is the process of removing common words that do not carry much meaning, such as "and" and "the." In the context of hikers' perceptions, the tidytext and tm packages in R were used for tokenization, lemmatization, and English stop words removal based on a predefined list of common English words.

Additionally, an additional set of words, such as the name of the country, towns, and specific hiking terms, may also be removed during data pre-processing.

Furthermore, word frequency counting is another preprocessing step that involves counting the occurrence of each word in the text data. This step is useful in identifying the most frequent single words (unigrams) that can represent the perceptions of hikers during their outdoor experience.

While the context does not explicitly mention other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning, these steps are commonly used in deep learning models. Normalization is the process of scaling numeric data to a range of [0, 1] or mean = 0, standard deviation = 1. Scaling is the process of adjusting the range of numeric data to fit the model's requirements. Cleaning is the process of removing or correcting erroneous or missing data.

Therefore, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model can include text translation, data pre-processing (tokenization, lemmatization, stop words removal, and word frequency counting), and other steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning.
