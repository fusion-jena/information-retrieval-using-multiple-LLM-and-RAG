The raw data used in the deep learning pipeline for FIREMAP, a vegetation recovery product, is collected primarily through sensors. More specifically, the data is obtained from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) which provides wildfire event information. The CEMS code, wildfire location, size, date, and ecosystem are all provided in the dataset. This information is likely gathered through satellite or aerial imagery and sensors, as the wildfire events are in various locations across Spain.

The sensors used to collect this data are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that they are likely remote sensing instruments on satellites or aircrafts, as the data is collected at a planetary scale using Google Earth Engine. This allows for large-scale geospatial analysis of the wildfire events.

Additionally, the data is used for both training samples and validating the FIREMAP burned area (BA) product. This means that the data is used to both train the deep learning model and to test its performance.

It is important to note that the data is based on post-fire Level-2 A data from the COPERNICUS/S2\_SR\_HARMONIZED dataset in GEE, which has been atmospherically corrected to provide interpretable canopy reflectance by PROSAIL-D RTM. This ensures that the data is accurate and reliable for use in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the raw data for the deep learning pipeline in FIREMAP is collected primarily through remote sensing instruments on satellites or aircrafts, which provide wildfire event information from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service. The data is then atmospherically corrected and used for both training and validating the deep learning model.
