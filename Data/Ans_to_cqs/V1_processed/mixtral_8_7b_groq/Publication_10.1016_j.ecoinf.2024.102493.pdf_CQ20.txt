Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The text focuses on the use of the Optimal Parameter-based Geographical Detector (OPGD) for identifying the explanatory power of different drivers related to spatial variance in the kNDVI (normalized difference vegetation index). It discusses the methods used for discretization and factor detection in the OPGD, as well as the variables considered as drivers, such as climate, terrain, and human activity factors. However, it does not mention any details about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
