The deep learning pipeline in the mentioned work uses the AdamW optimizer, which is a variant of the Adam optimizer. The Adam optimizer is a popular optimization technique that combines the ideas of two other optimization methods: AdaGrad and RMSProp (Kingma & Ba, 2014). It calculates unique adaptive learning rates for different parameters, considering both the first and second moments of the gradients.

The AdamW optimizer, on the other hand, decouples the weight decay from the original Adam optimizer (Loshchilov & Hutter, 2017). Weight decay, or L2 regularization, is a technique to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Decoupling weight decay in AdamW has been shown to improve generalization compared to the standard Adam optimizer.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in the given work utilizes the AdamW optimizer, which is an improvement over the Adam optimizer by decoupling weight decay and demonstrating better generalization.
