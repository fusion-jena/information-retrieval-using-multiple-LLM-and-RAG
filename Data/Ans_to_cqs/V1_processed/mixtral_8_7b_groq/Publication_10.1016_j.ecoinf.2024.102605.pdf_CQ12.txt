The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In the study by Zhang et al. (year not specified in the context), a machine learning algorithm, specifically a CNN, was used to construct a pest hazard class classification model. The CNN was employed to identify the degree of damage to forest trees by Erannis jacobsoni Djak. (EJD) in June, August, and September in the study area. The 1D-CNN algorithm performed well, yielding an overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient of 89.50% and 0.8666, respectively. The distribution of the pest damage identified by the 1D-CNN algorithm was consistent with the actual affected forest trees. Therefore, it can be concluded that a CNN is the type of deep learning model utilized in this pipeline.
