The provided context discusses the use of data augmentation as a method to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline for image-based species classification. However, it does not directly mention the use of regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization technique used in deep learning to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out neurons during training, which helps to break up co-adaptations between neurons. L2 regularization, on the other hand, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which can help to reduce overfitting.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these regularization techniques, it does discuss the use of data augmentation as a method to prevent overfitting. Data augmentation involves creating new training examples by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to the existing data. This can help to increase the size and diversity of the training set, which can improve the model's ability to generalize to new data and reduce overfitting.

In the study conducted by Sitepu et al. (2022), horizontal and vertical translations were applied within a range of 30 pixels, and shear distortion was applied within a range of 5 to improve the generalization of deep learning models. After data augmentation, the training dataset size was increased from 11,788 to 40,000 images.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly answer the query regarding the use of dropout and L2 regularization, it does suggest that data augmentation can be an effective method to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline.
