The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model for classification. The classification models mentioned are Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). Therefore, I cannot provide information on the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model because none was used in this study.

 The hyperparameters mentioned in the context for the RF model are related to the number of input variables for the decision trees (mtry). For the SVM model, the two hyperparameters are gamma, which controls the influence of the training data, and C, which affects misclassifications. In the case of MARS, the two hyperparameters are the degree, which determines the maximum degree of interactions between input variables, and nprune, which controls the complexity of the model.

 Therefore, the hyperparameters mentioned in the context are specific to RF, SVM, and MARS models, and not to a deep learning model.
