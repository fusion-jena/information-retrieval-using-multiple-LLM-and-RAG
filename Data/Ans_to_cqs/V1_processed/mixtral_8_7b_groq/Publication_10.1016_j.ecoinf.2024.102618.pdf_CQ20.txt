The provided context does not give information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It mentions the use of deep learning models for plant disease classification and the performance metrics used to evaluate their performance, but it does not mention any details about the computational resources used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
