Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context focuses on the description and comparison of different Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets used in ecological informatics research.

The datasets mentioned in the context are:

1. MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI dataset (MODIS NDVI)
2. NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of AVHRR NDVI V5 dataset (CDR AVHRR NDVI)
3. Third generation GIMMS NDVI from AVHRR sensors dataset (GIMMS NDVI)
4. SPOT/VEGETATION products (SPOT NDVI)

These datasets are obtained from various data sources and hosted on the Google Earth Engine platform, which is a planetary-level cloud computing platform. However, the context does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training deep learning models.
