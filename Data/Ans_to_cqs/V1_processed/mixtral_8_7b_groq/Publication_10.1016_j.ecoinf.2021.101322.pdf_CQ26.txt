The provided context discusses the use of transfer learning and pre-trained networks in the training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for salmon scale image classification, but it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some of the techniques alluded to in the text can be interpreted as addressing data bias indirectly.

One such technique is the use of transfer learning, where a pre-trained network is adapted to a new task. In this case, the pre-trained EfficientNet network was used, which was initially trained on the large and diverse ImageNet dataset. This dataset contains 1.4 million images in 1000 classes, which is more than 100 times the number of labeled salmon scale images used in the study. By using a pre-trained network that has already been trained on a large and diverse dataset, the authors are indirectly addressing data bias by leveraging the network's ability to abstract lower-level but more generally useful features.

Another technique that can be inferred from the context is the use of a larger dataset for training the CNN. The authors used a salmon scale image dataset of 9056 images, as well as an expert reading of an additional 150 images. While this is still a relatively small dataset compared to the ImageNet dataset, it is larger than what might have been used otherwise. By using a larger dataset, the authors are indirectly addressing data bias by providing the CNN with more examples to learn from.

The context also mentions that the authors gratefully acknowledge valuable advice on the CNN architecture provided by Hyeongji Kim from the Institute of Marine Research, Bergen, Norway. It is possible that this advice included recommendations on how to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it does allude to the use of transfer learning and a larger dataset, which can be interpreted as indirectly addressing data bias. Additionally, it is possible that the authors received advice on how to address data bias from a domain expert.
