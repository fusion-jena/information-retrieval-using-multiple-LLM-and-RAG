The provided context does not include information about the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text describes a proof-of-principle example using a comprehensive processing pipeline to mitigate device biases in site comparisons using ecoacoustic indices (EAI). However, there is no mention of any data repository or the deep learning pipeline's implementation details. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
