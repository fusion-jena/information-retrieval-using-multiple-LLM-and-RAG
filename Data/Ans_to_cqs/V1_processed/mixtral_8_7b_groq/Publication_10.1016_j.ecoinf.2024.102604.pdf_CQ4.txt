The provided context does not include information about data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. These techniques are commonly used in deep learning to increase the diversity of training data and improve model performance. However, the context focuses on bias correction methods in environmental covariates and model evaluation metrics.

In the context, two indicators are used to evaluate the effectiveness of bias correction methods: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ΔAUC) and the percentage of positive cases (ΔD). The aggregation background method tends to perform better when the sample size is limited to 70 or fewer.

Moreover, the context discusses a study by El-Gabbas and Dormann (2018) that proposes correcting sampling bias in environmental spaces by mapping the environmental space to the geographic space. This method aims to accurately reflect the efficacy of bias correction and requires further testing.

Therefore, while data augmentation techniques are essential in deep learning, the provided context does not contain information on these techniques.
