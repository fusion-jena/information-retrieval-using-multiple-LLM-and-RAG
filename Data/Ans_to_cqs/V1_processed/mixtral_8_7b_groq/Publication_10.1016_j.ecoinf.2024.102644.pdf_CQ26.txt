The provided pieces of context do not contain specific information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention the use of data from public repositories, which is improved with reliable records accurately and directly observed in the field. This suggests that the authors may have employed techniques to increase data quality and diversity.

In general, techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This method involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria, such as class labels, and then ensuring that each subset is proportionally represented in the training, validation, and test sets.
2. Oversampling: In cases where certain classes are underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from these classes. This can be done either by duplicating existing instances or by generating synthetic data using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Undersampling: Conversely, when some classes are overrepresented, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of instances from these classes. This can be done randomly or by using more sophisticated methods like Tomek links or Edited Nearest Neighbors.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique focuses on gathering data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the target population. This can help reduce bias and improve model generalization.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, it is possible that the authors have employed some of these methods to improve data quality and address data bias. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
