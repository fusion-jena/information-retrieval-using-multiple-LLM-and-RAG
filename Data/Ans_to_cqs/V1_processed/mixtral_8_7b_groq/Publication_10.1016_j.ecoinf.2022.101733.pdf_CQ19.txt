Based on the provided context, there is no information about which specific deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used to build the model. The context focuses on the types of data used in the study, including Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data, as well as various spectral and textural features. It also discusses the use of a support vector machine (SVM) for feature selection and parameter optimization. However, it does not mention any deep learning frameworks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
