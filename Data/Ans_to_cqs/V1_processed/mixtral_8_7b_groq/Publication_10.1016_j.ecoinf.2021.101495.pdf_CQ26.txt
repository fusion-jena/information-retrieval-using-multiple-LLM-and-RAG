Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some details about the data and computing infrastructure used in the training process of neural networks for fish species classification and segmentation.

In the study by Qiao et al. (2020), the authors used electronic monitoring data for longline fishing and applied deep learning methods for automated catch event detection. They trained two models, one manually with 275 segments and another automatically with 6921 segments, and used data augmentation with a factor of 12, resulting in a total of 14,896 images. However, they did not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

In the study by Rathi et al. (2017), the authors used underwater fish species images for classification using a convolutional neural network and deep learning. They used data from 22 fishing sets, but it is not clear whether they used any techniques to address data bias during preprocessing.

In the table provided, there is no information about data preprocessing techniques used to address data bias. The table only shows the computing infrastructure, search space, and best assignments of hyperparameters of the neural networks used for segmentation and classification tasks.

Therefore, based on the provided context, there is no clear answer to the query about the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, some possible techniques that could be used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These techniques can help ensure that the training data is representative of the population and reduce the risk of bias in the model's predictions.
