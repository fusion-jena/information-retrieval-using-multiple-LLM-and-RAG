The provided context does not offer direct information about the specific deep learning frameworks used in the study. However, it does mention the use of GPUs and TPUs, which are often utilized for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform numerous computations simultaneously.

Deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch are commonly used to build and train deep learning models. TensorFlow, developed by Google Brain, is a powerful library for numerical computation, particularly well-suited for large-scale Machine Learning (ML). It offers flexibility, robustness, and a wide range of tools for designing and training deep learning models.

PyTorch, developed by Facebook's AI Research lab, is another popular open-source deep learning framework. It provides a dynamic computational graph, which makes it easier to create and debug deep learning models. PyTorch is known for its simplicity and ease of use, as well as its strong community support.

Given the resources mentioned in the context (GPUs and TPUs) and the general popularity of TensorFlow and PyTorch, it is plausible that one or both of these frameworks were used to build the deep learning models in the study. However, without explicit information, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.
