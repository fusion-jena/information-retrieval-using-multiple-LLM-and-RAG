The provided context does not indicate that any type of deep learning model, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers, is used in the PLUS model. Instead, the model employs the Random Forest algorithm to obtain the development probabilities of each land use type based on two periods of land use data. This approach is considered superior to the FLUS model, which uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to determine development probabilities based on only one period of land use data. Therefore, the PLUS model does not use any of the specified deep learning models.
