Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific deep learning pipeline used in the study, nor are there any details about the data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The study focuses on beekeeping suitability mapping using various data types and a fuzzy inference system (Apis-FIS) but does not involve deep learning or data annotation techniques.

The data types used in the study include land use/land cover (LULC) maps, MNT-Lidar data, weather data, and databases of parcels and declared agricultural production (BDPPAD) along with the geobase of the Québec hydrographic network (GRHQ) and geobase addresses Québec. These data types are used to derive information relevant to beekeeping suitability, but they do not involve deep learning or data annotation techniques.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query regarding data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
