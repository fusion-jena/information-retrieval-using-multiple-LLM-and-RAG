Based on the provided context, there is no information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Hong et al., 2022. The study discusses the use of a spatial attention convolutional neural network (CNN) for estimating cyanobacteria pigments in the main rivers of South Korea using hyperspectral imagery. However, there is no mention of the code repository or where the implementation of the deep learning pipeline can be found.

The context includes references to other studies that use machine learning techniques for water quality parameters estimation, such as Md Mamun et al., 2022, which uses machine learning approaches with Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellite data. However, there is no information about the code repository for this study either.

It is possible that the authors have not made the code repository publicly available or that it is not hosted on popular platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an answer to this query without additional information.
