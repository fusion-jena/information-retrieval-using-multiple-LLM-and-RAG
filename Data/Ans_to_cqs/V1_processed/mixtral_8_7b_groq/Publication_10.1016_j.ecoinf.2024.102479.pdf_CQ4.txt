Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. However, data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in image processing and computer vision tasks, which often utilize deep learning models.

Data augmentation is a strategy that enables us to increase the amount of training data by generating modified versions of the existing data. This can help improve the model's performance and prevent overfitting. Some common data augmentation techniques include:

1. Flipping: This involves creating a mirrored image of the original data by flipping it horizontally or vertically. Flipping can help the model generalize better, especially when dealing with objects that have symmetrical features.

2. Rotating: Rotating the image by a certain angle can help the model learn to recognize objects in different orientations. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the object of interest can appear at various angles.

3. Scaling: Scaling or zooming the image can help the model learn to recognize objects at different sizes. This is important for real-world applications where objects can appear at varying distances from the camera.

While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is possible that they were used in the deep learning pipeline, given their widespread use in image processing and computer vision tasks. However, without access to the original study or its methodology, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.
