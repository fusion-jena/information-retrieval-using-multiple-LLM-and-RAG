In the context provided, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. This is enforced by the regularization loss, ‚Ñíreg, which controls the smoothness or the regularity of the latent space in a VAE. The KL divergence measures how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution. In this case, it is used to ensure that the encoder density matches the prior over the latent variable, p(z) ‚àº ùí© (0,I).

However, the provided context also discusses a method to balance the reconstruction- and regularization losses in a VAE using a hyperparameter Œ≤. This is not a regularization method per se, but rather a technique to manage the trade-off between the reconstruction quality and the regularization of the latent space. 

The context also mentions Œ≤-annealing as a method to achieve a reasonable trade-off between the loss terms. This is not a regularization method either, but a technique to gradually increase Œ≤ from a very low value up to a fixed point, solving initial stability problems.

Therefore, while the KL divergence is the regularization method used in the specific deep learning pipeline of a VAE discussed in the context, the context does not explicitly mention other regularization methods commonly used in deep learning, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, preventing over-dependence on any one neuron. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights, discouraging large weights and overfitting.
