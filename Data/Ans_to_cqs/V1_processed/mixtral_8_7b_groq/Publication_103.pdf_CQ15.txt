The provided context discusses the use of transfer learning and the modified GoogleNet model, but it does not directly mention any specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. However, it does provide some information that can help us infer potential optimization techniques used.

In the context, it is mentioned that the network is first trained on a big available dataset (dataset A) and then fine-tuned on the scarcer domain-specific data (dataset B). This process is called transfer learning, which is an optimization technique that leverages knowledge gained from training on one dataset and applies it to a different but related dataset.

The context also mentions that the network is trained using a multinomial logistic regression on top of the SOFTMAX layer and the linear classification layer. This implies that the network might be using a cross-entropy loss function, which is commonly used in deep learning for multi-class classification problems.

Furthermore, the context provides information about the implementation of the modified GoogleNet model using the Caffe framework. Caffe supports various optimization algorithms, such as SGD, Adagrad, Adadelta, and Adam. While the context does not explicitly specify which optimization algorithm was used, it is highly likely that one of these algorithms was used during the training process.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it does provide information that can help us infer potential techniques. These techniques might include transfer learning, cross-entropy loss function, and optimization algorithms such as SGD, Adagrad, Adadelta, or Adam.
