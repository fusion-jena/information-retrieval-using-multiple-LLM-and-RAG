The provided pieces of context do not contain explicit information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do give some insights into the types of data and file formats used in specific natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning studies.

In the Devlin et al. (2018) paper, the authors use the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model for pre-training deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding. The BERT model is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data, so the data format in this case is plain text.

The Edwards et al. (2022) study focuses on identifying wildlife observations on Twitter. Here, the data format consists of Twitter posts, which are likely in JSON format, containing various metadata and textual information.

Egarter Vigl et al. (2021) harness artificial intelligence technology and social media data to support cultural ecosystem service assessments. The data format in this study includes social media data, which can be in various formats such as JSON or CSV.

Feinerer and Hornik (2018) present the tm: Text mining package for R, which is used for text mining tasks. The data format in this case is text data, typically in plain text format.

GÃ¼nther et al. (2015) introduce a word embedding space called Gensim, which is based on the CBOW algorithm. The data format for this study is text data, which is used to train the word embedding model.

In summary, the provided context suggests that text data in plain text or JSON format is commonly used in NLP and machine learning studies. However, it is essential to note that the deep learning pipeline can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and CSV files, depending on the specific task and model.
