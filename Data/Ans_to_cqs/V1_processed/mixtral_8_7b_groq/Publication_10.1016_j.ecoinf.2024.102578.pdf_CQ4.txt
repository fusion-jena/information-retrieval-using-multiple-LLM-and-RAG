The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include rotation, width and height shift, shear transformation, zooming, and flipping. Specifically, the keras image\_data\_generator function was used for image augmentation, which included random assignment of the following: rotation range of 0-40 degrees, width and height shift range of 20%, shear range of 0-0.2 radians, zoom range of 0-0.2 scalar range, a horizontal flip, and a fill mode with the nearest pixel. These techniques were implemented to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the robustness of the model. By applying these transformations, the model is exposed to a wider variety of image configurations, which can help reduce overfitting and improve generalization. This, in turn, can lead to more accurate and reliable predictions when the model is deployed for real-world image classification tasks.
