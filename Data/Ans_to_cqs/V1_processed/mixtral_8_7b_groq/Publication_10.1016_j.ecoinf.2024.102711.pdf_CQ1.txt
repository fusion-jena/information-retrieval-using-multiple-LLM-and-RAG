The provided context does not directly discuss the methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of datasets in the context of automated machine learning (AutoML) and generative adversarial networks (GANs).

From the context, we can infer that the datasets used in the studies are likely obtained from various sources such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. For instance, one study uses a dataset related to forest fires in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot in India, which suggests that the data was collected using sensors or other monitoring systems (Babu et al., 2023). Another study uses a dataset related to land cover/land use classification, which could have been obtained from remote sensing data or other geospatial sources (Azedou et al., 2023).

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for tabular data (Ashrapov, 2020), which suggests that the raw data used in this study is likely in the form of tabular data, possibly obtained from databases or spreadsheets.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly discuss the methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that the data is likely collected from various sources such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets, depending on the specific application and domain of the study.
