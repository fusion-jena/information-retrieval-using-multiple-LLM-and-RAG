I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context includes detailed information about the training process, architecture, and hyperparameters of a deep learning model based on YOLOv5 and SENet attention mechanism. However, it does not mention the code repository or its location, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. I would recommend reaching out to the authors or checking the paper for more information on where to find the code repository.
