The context provided does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the comparison of two state-of-the-art classification techniques for large vocabulary bird species classification from flight calls. The models were evaluated on a dataset of 5428 flight calls from 43 different species, but the location of the data repository is not specified. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
