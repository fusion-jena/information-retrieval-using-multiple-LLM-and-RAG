The specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that some optimization algorithm was used during the training of the Mask R-CNN model.

In deep learning, optimizers are used to update the parameters of the model based on the computed gradients of the loss function. Commonly used optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, and Adam. Among these, Adam has gained popularity due to its adaptive learning rate and ability to handle non-stationary objectives.

In the context, the training and validation loss values are provided for Mask R-CNN after epoch 20. However, the optimizer used during training is not specified. The learning rate and decay rate are mentioned, but these are not optimizers themselves. The learning rate is a scalar value that determines the step size at each iteration, while the decay rate is used to reduce the learning rate over time.

It is possible that the authors used one of the aforementioned optimizers, such as Adam, in their deep learning pipeline. However, without explicit confirmation in the context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.

In summary, while the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that some optimizer was used during the training of the Mask R-CNN model. Common optimizers include SGD, Adagrad, Adadelta, and Adam, with Adam being a popular choice due to its adaptive learning rate.
