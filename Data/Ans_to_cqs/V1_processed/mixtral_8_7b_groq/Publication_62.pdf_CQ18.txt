The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, there are several elements mentioned that could be used to infer a performance monitoring strategy.

Firstly, the use of validation and testing datasets is implied through the separation of responsibilities in the 'Investigation' and 'Data curation' sections of the author contributions. This suggests that a portion of the data was set aside for validation and testing, which are common practices for monitoring model performance during training.

Secondly, the 'Formal analysis' section of the author contributions includes Paul B. Frandsen, RBD, and Abel Brown. These individuals are also responsible for the 'Software' and 'Validation' sections, which suggests that they may have implemented performance monitoring metrics within the software itself.

Thirdly, the use of a specific architecture for the unstained/stained CNN is detailed in Table 1 of the context. This includes various layers such as ConvolutionLayer, BatchNormalizationLayer, Ramp (ReLU), PoolingLayer, FlattenLayer, DropoutLayer, and LinearLayer. The use of these layers suggests a performance monitoring strategy, as they are commonly used to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

Lastly, the use of supplementary materials such as Mathematica notebooks and PDFs provides additional insight into the model performance monitoring strategy. Specifically, Suppl. material 1 and 2 detail the unstained/stained CNN, while Suppl. material 3 and 4 detail the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN. These materials may include performance monitoring metrics and visualizations.

In summary, while the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context, there are several elements that suggest a performance monitoring strategy was implemented. This includes the use of validation and testing datasets, the implementation of performance monitoring metrics within the software, the use of specific layers within the CNN architecture, and the provision of supplementary materials that may include performance monitoring metrics and visualizations.
