The text provided does not give explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the conservation assessment of Orchidaceae. However, it can be inferred that the data used for training the deep learning model is based on digitally available occurrence records, which include geographic, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic features. These features are likely extracted from existing databases or datasets, and therefore, may not require manual annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

The geographic features include mean latitude and longitude, longitudinal and latitudinal range, extent of occurrence (EOO), area of occupancy (AOO), number of locations, and occurrence records. The climatic features are based on 19 bioclim variables, which are likely derived from climate datasets. The biome features are based on the presence in 14 biomes, which may be obtained from existing biome classifications. The anthropogenic features are based on the Human Footprint Index, which is a composite measure of human influence on the environment.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the data annotation techniques used in this study are likely to be related to data collection, cleaning, and preprocessing rather than manual annotation techniques.
