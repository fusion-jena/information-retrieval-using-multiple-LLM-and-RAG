Based on the provided context, there is no clear information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning models for wildfire event prediction and estimation of best optimizer selection methods in Australia. Halgamuge et al. (2020) and Dowdy (2020) focused on developing and analyzing deep learning models and algorithms for wildfire prediction, but they did not mention the platform used for deployment.

Moreover, the paper by G. Charizanos and H. Demirhan (2023) presents a deep learning model for wildfire prediction, but it does not provide information about the platform used for deployment. Instead, the paper focuses on the model's architecture, parameters, and performance evaluation.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the platform used for deploying the deep learning models for wildfire event prediction and optimizer selection methods.

 The platform used for deploying the deep learning models for wildfire event prediction and optimizer selection methods is not specified in the provided context.
