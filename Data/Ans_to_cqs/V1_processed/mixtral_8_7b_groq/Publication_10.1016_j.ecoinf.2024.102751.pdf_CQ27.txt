Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. However, the text mentions the development of a predictive model for understanding water retention patterns on a coal mining heap. The model's development involved using various explanatory variables, such as topographic wetness indices, aspect, slope, and curvature. These variables were derived from Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data, which were downloaded from the General Office of Geodesy and Cartography's Geoportal.

The process of developing the predictive model may have included training a deep learning model using techniques such as serialization, platform selection, and model optimization. Serialization is the process of saving the trained model to disk so that it can be loaded and used later without having to retrain the model. Platform selection involves choosing the appropriate hardware and software environment for deploying the model. Model optimization may have been performed to ensure that the model runs efficiently on the chosen platform.

However, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to the query. It is possible that the model deployment process is not covered in the provided context or that it is not relevant to the research presented.

Therefore, the answer to the query is:

The provided context does not contain information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
