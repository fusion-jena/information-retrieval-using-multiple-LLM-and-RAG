The provided context does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization methods. The text does provide information about some of the hyperparameters used during the training of the model, such as the input image size, batch size, learning rate, and the use of a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer. However, it does not explain how these values were determined or if they were optimized in any way. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to this query.
