The provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of YOLOv7, Deep SORT, and a multiscale feature-extraction network (MSNet).

YOLOv7 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that is used for object detection. It is a member of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of models, which are known for their speed and accuracy in object detection tasks. The specific hyperparameters used in YOLOv7, such as the learning rate and optimizer, would depend on the implementation and training of the model.

Deep SORT is a tracking algorithm that is used for tracking objects in video sequences. It is an extension of the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm, which uses a Kalman filter to predict the position of objects and associates detections with tracks based on a cost function. Deep SORT improves upon SORT by using a deep neural network to learn a feature embedding for each object, which is used in the cost function for data association. The hyperparameters used in Deep SORT, such as the learning rate and optimizer for the feature embedding network, would also depend on the implementation and training of the model.

The multiscale feature-extraction network (MSNet) is a network that is used for extracting features from objects at multiple scales. This is useful for addressing the issue of changes in the scale of the target object, which can lead to matching errors in object tracking. The specific hyperparameters used in MSNet would depend on the implementation and training of the network.

In summary, the provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of YOLOv7, Deep SORT, and MSNet, which are all deep learning models with their own set of hyperparameters. The specific hyperparameters used in these models would depend on the implementation and training of the models.
