The deep learning models used in the pipeline are convolutional neural network (CNN) based models. Specifically, two object detection models were selected for comparison, YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN. YOLOv5 is a lightweight approach where objects are identified directly through a single pass, and it is based on CNNs. On the other hand, Faster R-CNN is a multi-stage network approach based on identifying potential regions and then categorizing and discarding some inappropriate regions, and it also uses CNNs as its backbone. Furthermore, a modified variant of YOLO with a Transformer Prediction Head (TPH-YOLOv5) was also tested, which is an extension of the YOLOv5s model and uses a Transformer-based head for prediction. However, the primary models used in the pipeline are CNN-based YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN.
