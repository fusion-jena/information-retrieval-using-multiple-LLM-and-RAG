The deep learning pipeline in the given context uses two specific datasets related to the detection of deforestation in Brazilian biomes, namely the Amazon and Cerrado datasets. These datasets are composed of satellite optical imagery, which are used to train and test the deep learning models.

The Amazon dataset has tiles with available defined deforestation samples and available no-deforestation samples. The number of samples in the training, validation, and test sets for the Amazon database are presented in Table 1. The Cerrado dataset has a similar structure, with tiles and available deforestation and no-deforestation samples. However, the specific number of samples for the Cerrado dataset is not provided in the context.

These datasets are used to train and evaluate three deep learning models: EF, SN, and CSVM. The EF network architecture consists of three convolutional layers, two max-pooling layers, two fully connected layers, and a softmax layer at the end with two outputs, corresponding to the "deforestation" and "no-deforestation" classes. The filter and output size of each layer are summarized in Table 3.

The deep learning pipeline uses a specific setup for training the models, including a batch size of 32, 100 number of epochs, early stopping after 10 epochs with no improvement, a dropout rate of 0.2 in the final FC layer, and the Adam optimizer with weight decay equal to 0.9 and a learning rate equal to 10âˆ’3. The binary cross-entropy is used as the loss function.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in this context uses the Amazon and Cerrado datasets for training and evaluating the EF, SN, and CSVM models.
