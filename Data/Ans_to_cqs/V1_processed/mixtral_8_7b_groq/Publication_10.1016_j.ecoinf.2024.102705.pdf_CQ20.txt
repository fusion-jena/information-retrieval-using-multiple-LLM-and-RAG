The text states that the experiments for training the deep learning model were conducted using a GTX2080Ti GPU. Therefore, we can conclude that a GPU, specifically the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, was used for training the deep learning model. It is not mentioned if any other hardware resources, such as TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), were used in the training process.
