In the context provided, there is no explicit information given on the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to split the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to train the model, i.e., to adjust the model's parameters to minimize the error on the training data. The validation set is used during the training process to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance. It helps to tune the hyperparameters of the model and prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and performs poorly on unseen data.

The testing set, which is independent of the training and validation sets, is used to assess the final performance of the trained model. It provides an unbiased estimate of how the model would generalize to new, unseen data.

The split of the data into these three subsets can be done randomly, but it is important to ensure that each subset is representative of the whole dataset. A common split is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. However, the exact split can depend on the size and quality of the data, as well as the specific requirements of the task.

In the context of bioacoustic classification, the paper by Soldevilla et al. (2008) uses a dataset of echolocation clicks from Rissoâ€™s and Pacific white-sided dolphins to train a neural network classifier. However, the paper does not provide details on how the data was split for training, validation, and testing.

The paper by Shorten et al. (2019) on image data augmentation for deep learning discusses various techniques to increase the size and diversity of the training set, but it does not mention the criteria used to split the data.

The paper by Simonis (2020) on a passive acoustic survey of deep-diving odontocetes in the California Current Ecosystem uses a large dataset of acoustic recordings, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, validation, and testing.

In conclusion, while the context provided does not give explicit information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it is common practice to use a training, validation, and testing split. The exact split can depend on the specific requirements of the task and the characteristics of the data.
