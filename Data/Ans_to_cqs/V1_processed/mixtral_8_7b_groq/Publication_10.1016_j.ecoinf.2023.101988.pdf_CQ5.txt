The provided context does not include information about the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline. The context includes references to studies using deep learning in the field of ecology, such as for animal biodiversity modeling using acoustic monitoring (Chalmers et al., 2021) and evaluating new technology for biodiversity monitoring (Corcoran et al., 2021). However, none of the sources mention the use of specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

Animal biodiversity modeling using acoustic monitoring and deep learning (Chalmers et al., 2021) uses audio recordings of animal sounds as input data. The study evaluates the effectiveness of deep learning models in identifying and classifying animal sounds, but it does not specify the use of any particular dataset.

The evaluation of new technology for biodiversity monitoring (Corcoran et al., 2021) compares drone surveys with traditional ground-based surveys for monitoring wildlife populations. The study uses drone-captured images and ground-based observations as input data, but it does not mention the use of any specific dataset.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query using the provided context.
