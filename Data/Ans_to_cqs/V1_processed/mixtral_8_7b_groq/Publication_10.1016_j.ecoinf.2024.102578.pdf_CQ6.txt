In the context provided, there is no explicit description of the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, other than the use of region-specific images for training separate two-class models for Finnmark and Yamal. However, it is common practice in deep learning to perform several preprocessing steps on the data before training a model. These steps can include data normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

Data normalization is the process of scaling numeric data to a range of [0, 1] or a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. This is important because deep learning models are sensitive to the scale of the input features. Normalization ensures that all features contribute equally to the learning process, and it helps the model converge faster during training.

Scaling is the process of transforming the data to have similar ranges. This is important when the features have different scales, as it can prevent some features from dominating the learning process.

Cleaning is the process of removing outliers, missing values, and irrelevant features from the data. This is important because deep learning models are sensitive to noise and irrelevant features, which can negatively impact the model's performance.

In the context provided, it is likely that the authors performed some or all of these preprocessing steps on the region-specific images before training the two-class models. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
