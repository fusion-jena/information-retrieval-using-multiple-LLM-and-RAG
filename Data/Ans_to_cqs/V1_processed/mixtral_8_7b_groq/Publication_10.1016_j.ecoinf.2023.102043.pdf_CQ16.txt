The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the classification algorithm. Commonly used criteria for determining training completion include validation loss plateau, accuracy reaching a certain threshold, or a predetermined number of training epochs.

In the context, there is information about the dataset, annotation, exploration, and a classification algorithm that can be improved using the provided dataset. The dataset is collected from four farms (A, B, C, and D) with varying durations and numbers of audio files and annotations. The data is used to train a model that classifies events or activities, and users can correct any misclassifications to improve the model in an online mode.

However, the context does not mention any specific details about the training process or the criteria used to determine training completion. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query based on the given context.
