Based on the provided context, the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. The text discusses the use of machine learning and deep learning strategies in the context of ecological informatics and species habitat use modeling, but it does not go into detail about the optimization techniques utilized in these deep learning pipelines.

The context does mention the use of Maxent, a machine learning method, and neural networks, which are a type of deep learning model. However, it does not provide information on the optimization techniques applied within these models. Common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants, such as Adam.

In summary, while the text discusses the use of deep learning strategies in ecological informatics, it does not provide specific information on the optimization techniques applied within these deep learning pipelines.
