The data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the study do not include rotation, flipping, or scaling. Instead, the following techniques were used:

1. Adding Gaussian noise: This technique was used to create more low-resolution images that resemble those that users might upload. Two augmentations of this type were performed, with different choices of noise level in the range of 0 to 255*0.2.
2. Sea waves distortion: This technique was used to create more images where sea waves are reflected. The distortion was applied with an alpha value of 50 and a sigma value of 9.
3. Blurring effect: This technique was used to create more unclear images, similar to some of the original images. The blurring effect was applied in the range of (0.75, 1.5), and two augmentations of this type were performed with different choices of blur level.

These techniques were applied using standard functions from the IMGAUG library of openCV. It is worth noting that the study found that preprocessing the input instead of relying on data augmentation resulted in significantly better results. However, the authors suggest that there may still be a better way to exploit the power of augmentations while bypassing the difficulty of the Siamese network to learn similarity in the presence of few examples.
