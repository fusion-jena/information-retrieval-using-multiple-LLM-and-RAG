The provided context discusses the issue of data bias in the field of ecoacoustics, particularly with regard to differences between recording devices. It explains how specific metrics (K-S and DKL) are used to quantify the effectiveness of bias reduction strategies within this field. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.

The techniques you mentioned, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, are commonly used to address data bias in machine learning and deep learning. Stratified splitting ensures that the train and test sets have similar distributions of labels, oversampling replicates samples from the minority class to balance the dataset, undersampling reduces the number of samples from the majority class, and diverse data collection ensures that the dataset represents the entire range of variability in the target population.

In the context of ecoacoustics, the provided text suggests that the authors use a preprocessing methodology consisting of three steps: normalization, feature scaling, and bias reduction. However, it does not explicitly mention any of the techniques you listed.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine whether the techniques you mentioned are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in ecoacoustics.
