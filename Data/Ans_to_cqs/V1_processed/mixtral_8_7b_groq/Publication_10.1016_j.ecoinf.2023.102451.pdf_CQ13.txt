The context provided does not give specific information about the learning rate and optimizer used in the EMViT-Net framework. However, it does mention that the EMViT-Net framework achieves prominent results compared to other deep learning models when trained with an augmented set of EMDS-6 datasets.

The experimental setup section describes the system configuration used for training and experiments of the proposed model, including the kernel size and strides used in the convolutional layer, the use of max-pooling and average pooling, and the addition of a separable convolutional parameter-sharing attention block with batch normalization. However, it does not mention the learning rate or optimizer used.

The performance evaluation section compares the performance of EMViT-Net with other deep learning models on the EMDS-6 test set, including DenseNet121, Alex Net, ViT, ResNet50, Xception Net, VGG19, Inception V3, and VGG16. The metrics used for comparison are average precision, average recall, average F1-score, and accuracy. However, the learning rate and optimizer used for each model are not specified.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the specific hyperparameters used in the EMViT-Net deep learning model, including the learning rate and optimizer, are not known.
