I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided context does not contain information about deep learning pipelines or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context focuses on geographic conditions, vegetation conditions, and various data sources and indicators related to resource and environment science.

To provide a helpful response, I'd be happy to explain the concept of these datasets in deep learning:

1. MNIST: This is a dataset of handwritten digits (0-9) widely used for training and testing image recognition models. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of which is a 28x28 grayscale image.
2. CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100: These are datasets of tiny images, used for object recognition tasks. CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. CIFAR-100 is similar but has 100 classes, each containing 600 images.
3. ImageNet: This is a large-scale dataset of over 14 million images, organized according to the WordNet hierarchy (1,000 categories for the ILSVRC competition). It is widely used for object detection, image classification, and other computer vision tasks.

These datasets are commonly used for benchmarking deep learning models, comparing model architectures, and evaluating the performance of various techniques in the field of machine learning.
