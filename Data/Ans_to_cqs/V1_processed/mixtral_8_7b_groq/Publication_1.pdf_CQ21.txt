Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about post-processing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix after model training. However, the context does mention some activities that occur after model training, which include:

1. Data analysis: This involves exploring and searching large volumes of sensor data, providing a richer set of elemental signal attributes, a more natural-language interface, and the ability to search by exemplars.
2. Auditing: This involves running existing deep learning (DL) models against survey data to automatically classify and detect species or events of interest for each project. The models output the relative probability that an event is from a specific data class, and analysts can sort the data accordingly. Analysts are then presented with ranked pages containing a large number of panels, where each panel contains a visualization of an individual data sample. For images, the visualization consists of image cropping around the object of interest, contrast enhancement, and consecutive frame differences. For audio, 2D spectrograms of an appropriate duration are displayed per panel.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, it does mention some post-processing activities, such as data analysis and auditing, that occur after model training.
