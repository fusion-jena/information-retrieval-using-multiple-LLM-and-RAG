Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that they used pre-trained ImageNet weights for initialization and fine-tuned the models to their specific datasets. This approach could potentially help with generalizability, as the models are starting from weights that have already been trained on a large and diverse dataset.

Additionally, the authors employed Bayesian optimization to find the optimal values for batch size and initial learning rate. This technique could potentially help with generalizability by finding hyperparameters that lead to better performance on the validation dataset.

The authors also used ensemble methods, specifically stacked ensemble models, to improve the performance of the models. While this doesn't directly address generalizability, it can help to reduce the variance of the model and improve its overall performance.

Finally, the authors analyzed the performance of SVM and KNN as meta learners and found that they outperformed the other classifiers in most cases. This could potentially suggest that these models are better able to generalize to new data, as they are able to learn a decision boundary that is more robust to noise and outliers.

Overall, while the provided context does not explicitly mention common techniques for improving generalizability such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, the authors did employ other techniques such as transfer learning, Bayesian optimization, ensemble methods, and meta learners that could potentially help to improve the generalizability of their deep learning models.
