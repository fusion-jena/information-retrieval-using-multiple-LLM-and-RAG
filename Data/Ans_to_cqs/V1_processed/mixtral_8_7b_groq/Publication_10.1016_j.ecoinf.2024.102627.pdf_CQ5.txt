The provided context does not explicitly name the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the model is trained on presence-only data, which suggests that the dataset consists of observations of species occurrences rather than a pre-existing dataset like MNIST or ImageNet.

Additionally, the context describes the predictive features used in the model, which include WorldClim2 bioclimatic variables, Soilgrids pedological variables, human footprint rasters, terrestrial ecoregions of the world, and the observation location (longitude and latitude). These features are likely to be part of the dataset used in the pipeline, although they are not standard computer vision or natural language processing datasets.

Therefore, while the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not specified in the provided context, it is clear that the model is trained on presence-only observations and uses a variety of environmental predictors as input features.
