The provided context discusses the use of data augmentation as a technique to diversify the training data, but it does not explicitly mention any other preprocessing methods such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling to address data bias. However, it does mention that they followed current best practices in deep learning, which could include techniques to address data bias.

The data augmentation method used in this case is a 3-s window length, which enables the implementation of data diversity. This method is used to increase the amount of training data by creating new samples from the existing data through various transformations, such as rotations, translations, or flips in image data. In this case, the authors used 3-s windows of mel spectrograms of audio data, which were treated as monochrome input images.

The model design consists of 157 layers, of which 36 are weighted, and follows the Wide ResNet approach by Zagoruyko and Komodakis. The pre-processing includes a 5x5 Conv+BN+ReLU, Ma√ó pooling, and a downsampling block, followed by multiple ResBlock layers. The final layers include a Global LME pooling and Sigmoid activation, resulting in probability predictions for all 987 classes per second.

In summary, the provided context discusses the use of data augmentation as a technique to diversify the training data, but it does not explicitly mention any other preprocessing methods such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling to address data bias. However, it is mentioned that they followed current best practices in deep learning, which could include these techniques.
