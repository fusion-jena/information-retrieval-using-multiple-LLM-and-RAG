Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text does not mention any specific techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization methods.

However, it does discuss the performance of predictive models and data massaging strategies for handling structural incompleteness. It also provides tables and figures summarizing the results of these experiments. These results could have been obtained by tuning hyperparameters, but the text does not provide enough detail to determine if this was the case or which optimization method was used.

In summary, while the text discusses the performance of predictive models and data massaging strategies, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized.
