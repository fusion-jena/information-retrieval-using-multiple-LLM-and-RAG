Based on the provided context, I cannot directly determine the specific purpose of a deep learning model since the text does not mention a model explicitly. However, I can infer that deep learning models have been used or could be applied in the context of soil and water management, lake health, and land use changes. Here are some possible purposes of deep learning models in these domains:

1. Soil salinity detection and mapping: Deep learning models can be used for classification or detection tasks to identify and map soil salinity based on satellite images and ground-based measurements. For example, Yang et al. (2020) compared Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI for detecting soil salinity in an arid desert region in Northwest China. Similarly, Aksoy et al. (2022) analyzed the performance of three machine-learning algorithms for mapping soil salinity in the Urmia Lake basin.

2. Water resource management and lake volume prediction: Deep learning models can be employed for segmentation or regression tasks to predict water resource availability and lake volume changes. For instance, Safarian Zengir et al. (2020) monitored and investigated the possibility of forecasting drought in the western part of Iran. Additionally, Rahimi and Breuste (2021) used prognostic modeling with land-use data and an artificial neural network to understand the reasons behind Lake Urmia drying up.

3. Land-use change analysis and geological history: Deep learning models can be applied for image analysis or time-series prediction tasks to understand land-use changes and geological history. Sala et al. (2020) discussed the geological history and present conditions of Lake Balkhash, and Seydehmet et al. (2018) modeled secondary soil salinization in the Keriya Oasis, Northwest China.

In summary, deep learning models can serve various purposes in the context of soil and water management, lake health, and land use changes. These models can be used for classification, segmentation, detection, or regression tasks to predict soil salinity, water resource availability, and land-use changes. However, the provided context does not mention a specific deep learning model or its purpose.
