Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam used in the deep learning pipeline for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana as described in the paper by Gallwey et al., 2020.

However, it is mentioned that the deep learning model used in the study is a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a type of neural network that has been widely used for image classification tasks. During the training of CNNs, optimization techniques are indeed used to minimize the loss function and update the weights of the model. Common optimization techniques for CNNs include SGD, Adam, and others.

Therefore, while the specific optimization technique used in the study by Gallwey et al., 2020 is not mentioned, it is likely that one of the commonly used optimization techniques for CNNs was applied in their deep learning pipeline.
