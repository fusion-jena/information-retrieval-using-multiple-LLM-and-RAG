The study "Deep learning based retrieval of forest" used deep learning methods but it does not specify the hardware resources used for training the model. The study utilized a training-and-test approach with stratification splitting, tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set, and model training using an optimal setting of the hyperparameter. However, it does not provide information about the hardware used for training the deep learning model.
