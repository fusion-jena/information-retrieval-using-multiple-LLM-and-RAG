Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline using ResNet-50, MegaDetector, and time-lapse camera data for Arctic wildlife monitoring. The article is from the journal Ecological Informatics, authored by G. Celis and colleagues from Google AI for Nature and Society in Mountain View, California, USA, and published in 2024. However, the abstract does mention the use of these deep learning tools and Arctic wildlife monitoring, and it includes performance metrics for the workflow. Nonetheless, the context does not include any information about the code repository location, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
