Based on the provided context, I cannot determine the specific deep learning frameworks (such as TensorFlow or PyTorch) used to build the model. The context discusses various machine learning models and techniques, but it does not specify the use of any deep learning frameworks. Therefore, I must answer that I do not know the answer to this query.
