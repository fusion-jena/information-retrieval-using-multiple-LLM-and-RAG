The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It mentions the use of deep learning models such as YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN for detecting Pacific oysters, but it does not specify the computing hardware used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
