The types of deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and a hybrid model combining CNN and LSTM, referred to as CNN-LSTM.

The study describes the structure of the CNN model, which includes an image input layer, a convolutional layer, a maximum pooling layer, two fully connected layers, and a regression output layer. The LSTM model consists of a sequence input layer, an LSTM layer, two fully connected layers, and a regression output layer. The hybrid CNN-LSTM model combines the strengths of both CNN and LSTM networks, offering significant advantages over using either network alone.

The input time series length and solver for training the networks vary for each model. The table provided shows the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for each model, trained with different solvers (adam, sgdm, RMSProp) and input time series lengths (3 days, 5 days, and 7 days). The performance of these deep learning models varies across different Chl concentration regions, with the CNN-LSTM model consistently achieving the highest R2 values across all regions, whereas the CNN model has the lowest R2 values.

In summary, the deep learning models used in the pipeline are CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM. These models are applied to predict Chl concentration, and their performance varies depending on the input time series length, solver for training, and Chl concentration region. The hybrid CNN-LSTM model outperforms both standalone CNN and LSTM models, making it a promising approach for predicting Chl concentration.
