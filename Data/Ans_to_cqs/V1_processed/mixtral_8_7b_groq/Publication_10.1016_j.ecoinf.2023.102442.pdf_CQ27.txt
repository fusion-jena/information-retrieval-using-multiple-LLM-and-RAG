The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model is not explicitly described in the given texts. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some steps that might have been taken.

The model was likely serialized, or saved, to ensure that it could be deployed and used for predicting the location of mining activities. This is a common practice in machine learning to save the trained model so that it can be used later without having to retrain the model.

Regarding platform selection, the authors used Google Earth Engine (GEE) for the initial land use and land cover (LULC) classification. GEE is a cloud processing platform that provides access to petabytes of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. It allows for high performance and rapid planetary-scale processing and analysis of images. Therefore, it is likely that the trained deep learning model was deployed on this platform for predicting mining activities.

The authors also mention that they used a minimum size of 3 pixels (or > 2700 m2) to select mining pixels. This step was taken to remove the influence of small, misclassified pixels on the reclassification of water bodies. This step might have been implemented after deploying the trained deep learning model.

In summary, while the exact process of deploying the trained deep learning model is not described, we can infer that the model was likely serialized, and the authors used Google Earth Engine as the platform for deploying the model. Additionally, the authors used a minimum size of 3 pixels to select mining pixels, which might have been implemented after deploying the model.
