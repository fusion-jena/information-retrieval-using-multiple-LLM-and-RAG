In the context of deep learning for permafrost modeling, various methods are utilized for collecting raw data. These methods can be broadly categorized into in-situ measurements (sensors), remote sensing (satellite data), and surveys or data collection campaigns.

In-situ measurements often involve the use of sensors to collect data on various environmental factors that affect permafrost. For instance, soil temperature profiles are measured using thermistors or other temperature sensors. Soil moisture content is measured using sensors such as time-domain reflectometry (TDR) probes or neutron probes. Soil density and particle size distribution can be determined using techniques such as sieving and laser diffraction. Vegetation height and density can be measured using instruments such as rulers or laser rangefinders. Solar radiation and thermal conductivity can be measured using pyranometers and heat flux plates, respectively.

Remote sensing techniques, particularly satellite data, are also widely used in permafrost modeling. These data can provide information on snow depth, soil moisture, vegetation cover, and other relevant variables over large areas. For example, passive microwave remote sensing can be used to estimate snow depth and soil moisture content. Optical remote sensing can provide information on vegetation cover and height. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) can be used to estimate soil moisture, vegetation biomass, and other variables.

Surveys and data collection campaigns are another important source of data for permafrost modeling. These can involve the collection of data through field campaigns, where measurements are taken at specific points in time and space. For example, surveys can be conducted to measure the depth of seasonal freezing and thawing, the position of the freezing/thawing interface, and the depth to the permafrost table. These surveys can be conducted using methods such as ground-penetrating radar (GPR), electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), or borehole drilling.

Public datasets are also an important source of data for permafrost modeling. These datasets can provide a wealth of information on environmental variables relevant to permafrost, such as temperature, precipitation, and vegetation cover. For example, the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) provides temperature and precipitation data, while the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides vegetation cover data.

In summary, a variety of methods are utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for permafrost modeling. These methods include in-situ measurements using sensors, remote sensing using satellite data, surveys and data collection campaigns, and the use of public datasets.
