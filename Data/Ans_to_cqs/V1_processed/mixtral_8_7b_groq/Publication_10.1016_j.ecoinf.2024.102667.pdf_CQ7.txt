Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context focuses on the methodology of analyzing Grassland Spectral Net (GSN) change trend and land use/cover data, but it does not mention data splitting for deep learning model training.

However, generally, in deep learning model training, data splitting is a common practice to ensure the model's generalization and prevent overfitting. The data is typically divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing.

1. Training set: This set is used to train the model by adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the error between the predicted and actual values.
2. Validation set: This set is used during the training phase to validate the model's performance and tune the hyperparameters.
3. Testing set: This set is used to evaluate the final model's performance on unseen data.

The criteria for splitting the data can vary depending on the problem and the dataset's size. Commonly, the data is split into 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. However, other strategies, such as k-fold cross-validation, can also be used.

Therefore, while the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used for data splitting, it is a crucial step in deep learning model training.
