The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data used in the studies mentioned are related to disease vector abundances and weather conditions. These could have been obtained from sensors or monitoring systems deployed in the field to gather data on mosquito populations and weather variables. Public datasets or previous research studies may have also provided some of this information. Additionally, surveys could have been used to collect data on human disease cases, which would be an important factor in studying disease vector abundances. However, these are just possibilities and the specific methods used for data collection are not specified in the given context.
