Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model is likely to be trained on a system with powerful computational capabilities, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), due to the complexity of the deep learning model and the large dataset used for training.

The deep learning model in question is based on YAMNet, a pre-trained neural network that follows the MobileV1 convolution architecture and is trained on data from 521 classes. The audio data used for training the model is processed by converting it to a monophonic channel, resampling it at 16 kHz, extracting the spectrogram using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) magnitudes of 25 ms overlapped by 15 ms, and calculating the Mel spectrogram by mapping it to 64 bins of the Mel scale within the range of 125â€“7500 Hz.

The YAMNet model extracts embeddings from the processed audio data, which are then fed as input to a sequential and reduce mean layer mapping to the classes mentioned above. The final layers of the network map the YAMNet embeddings to the available labels.

The dataset used for training the model consists of approximately 10 million sound events lasting more than 34,000 hours, collected from four farms over the course of a year. Therefore, the training process is likely to require significant computational resources to handle the large dataset and complex model architecture.

In summary, while the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model are not mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that the model is likely to be trained on a system with powerful computational capabilities, such as GPUs or TPUs, due to the complexity of the model and the large dataset used for training.
