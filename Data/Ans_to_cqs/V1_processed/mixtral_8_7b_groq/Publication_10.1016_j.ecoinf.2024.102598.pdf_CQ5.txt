The provided context discusses various models and techniques used in forest fire prediction, but it does not mention any specific datasets related to deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention the use of machine learning models (MLMs) in fire prediction studies.

In the context, it is stated that recent advancements in MLMs make them capable of handling complex datasets and offering valuable insights into forest fire dynamics. Some of the popular MLMs used in fire prediction studies include support vector machines, neural networks, kernel logistic regression, and hybrid artificial methods like random forest.

Moreover, the context also discusses the use of data mining techniques to extract valuable information from large datasets, enabling the identification of hidden patterns and relationships between variables related to forest fires. Therefore, it can be inferred that large datasets related to forest fires are used in MLM-based fire prediction studies.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention any specific deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it does discuss the use of MLMs in fire prediction studies and the importance of large datasets in this context.
