The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models mentioned, namely Deeplabv3+, Unet, and TernausNet. It is possible that the models were trained using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), or other specialized hardware, but the text does not offer details on this aspect. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
