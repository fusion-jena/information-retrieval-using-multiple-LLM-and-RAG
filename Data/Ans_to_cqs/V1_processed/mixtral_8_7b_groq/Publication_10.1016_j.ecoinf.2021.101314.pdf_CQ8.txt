The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the process of generating redescriptions, which are defined as "interpretable, not overly complex (long) queries" that involve dental and climate variables. The study generated two sets of redescriptions, one with strict explicit constraints and one with a stringent threshold on accuracy gains, resulting in 271 and 188 redescriptions, respectively.

The method used to generate these redescriptions involves manually setting several parameters, including thresholds on the size of the support of the output redescriptions and controlling the length and complexity of their queries. However, there is no mention of a code repository or where the deep learning pipeline used in the study can be found.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it is not included in the provided context.
