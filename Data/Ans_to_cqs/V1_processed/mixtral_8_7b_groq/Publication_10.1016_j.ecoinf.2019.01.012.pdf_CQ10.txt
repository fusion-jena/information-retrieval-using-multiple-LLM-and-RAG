I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the methodology and process of classifying woody vegetation using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), including the choice of CNN architecture, activation functions, optimizer, and the number of iterations for training. However, it does not mention where the code for this project is located.
