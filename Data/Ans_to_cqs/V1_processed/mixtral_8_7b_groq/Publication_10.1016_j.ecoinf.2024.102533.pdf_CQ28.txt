The provided context does not contain information about the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. There are several research papers and data sets from "Ecological Informatics 80 (2024)" by E. Prasetyo et al., as well as some numerical data and figures. However, there is no mention of the cloud platform or any other deployment platform for the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
