The provided context does not include specific information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. However, it does mention the use of data for various purposes in the research, such as the data extracted from Figure 2 related to the states of each cell, denoted as M (masks of states) with dimensions 257 × 257 × 9.

In general, data splitting for deep learning model training is an important step to evaluate the performance and generalization of the model. The most common approach is to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the selected model.

There are different criteria to split the data, and the choice of criteria depends on the specific problem and the amount of available data. Some common criteria include:

1. Random splitting: The data is split randomly into training, validation, and testing sets. This is the simplest and most common approach, but it may not be suitable for imbalanced datasets.
2. Time series splitting: If the data is collected over time, it can be split based on time. For example, the data up to a certain date can be used for training, the data from the next period for validation, and the data from the last period for testing.
3. Stratified splitting: If the data has categorical variables, the data can be split based on the categories to ensure that each set has a representative sample of each category.
4. Cross-validation: Instead of splitting the data into three sets, the data can be split into k folds. The model is trained and validated k times, each time with a different fold as the validation set and the remaining k-1 folds as the training set. The average performance over the k folds is used as the final performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not include specific information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it is an important step to ensure the performance and generalization of the model. The choice of criteria depends on the specific problem and the amount of available data.
