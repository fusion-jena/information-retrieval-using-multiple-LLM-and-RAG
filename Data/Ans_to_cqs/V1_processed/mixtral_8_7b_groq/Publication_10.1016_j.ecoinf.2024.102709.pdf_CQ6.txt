In the context provided, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include image inversion and potential techniques such as inpainting or thickening points to generate lines. Image inversion was performed using the OpenCV library in Python, where white pixels representing markings were switched to black pixels, and black pixels representing the background were switched to white pixels. This step aimed to prepare the image data for the model's input requirements.

Additionally, the text mentions the use of Labelbox for annotating labels to the original images, which could be considered another preprocessing step. Labeling is crucial for supervised learning models, as it provides the necessary ground truth for training.

However, the context does not explicitly mention other common preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or data cleaning. Normalization and scaling are often used to adjust the range of input features, making it easier for the model to learn and generalize. Data cleaning, on the other hand, involves handling missing values, outliers, or duplicate data to ensure the quality of the input data.

In summary, the preprocessing steps mentioned in the context include image inversion and labeling. Other typical preprocessing techniques, such as normalization, scaling, and data cleaning, are not explicitly mentioned but could have been employed as part of the overall data preparation process.
