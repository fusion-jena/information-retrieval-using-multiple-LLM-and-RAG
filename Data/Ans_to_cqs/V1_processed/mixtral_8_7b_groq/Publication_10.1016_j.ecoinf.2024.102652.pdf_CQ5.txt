Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. The text focuses on the use of a modified U-NET (MU-NET) algorithm for soil salinity detection and segmentation using remote sensing images. It mentions that a 5-band multispectral image was used and five salinity indices were added, increasing the total number of bands. However, it does not specify the source or name of the dataset used. Therefore, I cannot provide information on the datasets used in this deep learning pipeline.
