The deep learning model described in the text is designed for classification tasks. Specifically, it is used to classify a given spectrogram input into one of the 22 species categories. The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that consists of two convolutional layers, each followed by max pooling, a flattening operation, and two fully-connected layers. The output of the model is a probability for each of the 22 species.

The authors also explore the use of a multi-branch CNN to incorporate additional contextual information while maintaining model simplicity. This approach is adopted based on preliminary experiments using the Hainan gibbon case study and the network developed by Dufourq et al. (2021), which showed good results for the bird classification task.

The deep learning model is trained on a relatively small number of examples, which is common in ecology datasets. The proposed methodology can be adapted to other CNN architectures, and the open-source code is available on GitHub, with the data used being freely accessible on Zenodo.

In summary, the deep learning model described in the text is designed for classification tasks, specifically for classifying spectrogram inputs into one of the 22 species categories. The authors also explore the use of a multi-branch CNN to incorporate additional contextual information. The model is trained on a small number of examples and can be adapted to other CNN architectures.
