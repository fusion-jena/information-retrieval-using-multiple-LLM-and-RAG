The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, as described in the provided context, includes model serialization and platform selection. 

Firstly, the best performing model was saved at the end of the training process. This was done to ensure that the model with the lowest validation loss was used for actual deployment, thereby maximizing the model's performance on unseen data. Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model so that it can be used later for making predictions. In this case, the model was saved using the Keras model.save() function, which saves the model's architecture, weights, and optimizer in a single file.

Secondly, the platform for deployment was selected. The model was implemented using Keras with TensorFlow backend, which provides flexibility and ease of use for deep learning model development. However, for deployment, a platform that can handle real-time requests and serve the model's predictions efficiently is required. Here, the choice of platform is not specified in the provided context. However, popular platforms for deep learning model deployment include cloud services like Google Cloud AI Platform, AWS SageMaker, and Azure Machine Learning, as well as on-premise solutions like TensorFlow Serving and TorchServe.

Lastly, the deployed model was integrated with an application or service that requires image segmentation. The application would send an image to the deployed model, and the model would return the segmented image, with the leaf or background class assigned to each pixel.

In summary, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved saving the best performing model, choosing a suitable platform for deployment, and integrating the deployed model with an application or service.
