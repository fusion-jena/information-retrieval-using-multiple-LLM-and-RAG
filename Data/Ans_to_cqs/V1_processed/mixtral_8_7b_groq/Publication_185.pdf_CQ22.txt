The specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in the given context are accuracy and validation accuracy. 

Accuracy is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model. It is calculated as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions made. In this case, the models, MG and MO, achieved good training results when the parameters were chosen properly. However, the context does not provide specific accuracy values for these models.

Validation accuracy, on the other hand, is used to evaluate the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. It is calculated by testing the model on a separate validation set. The new model, used to compare balanced data performance with imbalanced data, achieved a validation accuracy of 94%. This decrease in accuracy can be attributed to the decrease in data size due to resampling.

Other metrics such as precision and recall are not explicitly mentioned in the context. Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. It measures the model's ability to not label negative instances as positive. Recall, on the other hand, is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. It measures the model's ability to find all positive instances. These metrics can be particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced data, as they provide insights into the model's performance for each class.

In conclusion, the deep learning models in the given context are evaluated using accuracy and validation accuracy. Other metrics such as precision and recall, which can be beneficial in evaluating model performance with imbalanced data, are not mentioned.
