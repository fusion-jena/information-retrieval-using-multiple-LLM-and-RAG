The deep learning model in question is designed for the purpose of classification. More specifically, it is used to classify environmental conditions in terrestrial images. The model is based on the VGG architecture, but it contains only 12 layers as opposed to the conventional 16 or 19 layers found in VGG16 or VGG19 models. This was done to optimize the model for the specific task at hand. The model is trained and tested using 12,000 frames extracted from 1500 videos, with each frame being classified into one of six environmental condition classes. The models are trained over 100 epochs and return an average loss value of 0.0126 with an average accuracy of 99.3% during training and testing. To select the best performing model, the five CNN models are validated using a separate validation dataset consisting of 1500 videos that were held-out from training. A random frame is extracted from each validation dataset video, and all five CNN models are used to classify the videos into the six environmental condition classes. The results of the validation phase are detailed in Section 3.1 of the report. Therefore, the deep learning model in question is specifically designed and used for the purpose of environmental condition classification in terrestrial images.
