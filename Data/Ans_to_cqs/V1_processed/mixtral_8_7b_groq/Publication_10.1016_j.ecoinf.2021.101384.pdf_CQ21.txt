Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix following model training. The text focuses on describing the process of associating information on stocks, species variety, and threatening status to the fishing hours of each cell in a studied area. It also mentions the use of an Open Science workflow that combines vessel tracking data from satellite and AIS systems with global, high-quality, environmental, biodiversity, and fishery data.

However, it does not detail any postprocessing steps after model training. It does mention statistical analysis, but it is unclear if this refers to postprocessing or to an earlier step in the process. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a precise answer to the query.
