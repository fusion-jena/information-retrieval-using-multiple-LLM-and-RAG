The data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline can include various methods such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation, but the context provided does not specify these techniques explicitly. However, it does mention the use of annotations for a certain class, which can be done using class labels. Additionally, it discusses semantic segmentation, which is a pixel-wise classification task where each pixel in an image is assigned to a specific class.

In the context of semantic segmentation, the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric is used to evaluate the performance of the model. IoU is calculated as the area of overlap between the predicted and ground truth segmentation masks divided by the area of union of the two masks.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of semi-supervised learning and active learning to reduce the time and costs for training data annotation. In semi-supervised learning, the model is trained on a dataset where only a part of the data is labeled, while in active learning, the model can interactively perform a query to label new data points with the desired outputs.

The context also describes a specific workflow for joint energy-based semantic segmentation (JESS) that involves fieldwork, annotation of images with Labelbox, data processing using Python, deep learning implementation with PyTorch, and energy-based optimization. In this workflow, the annotation of images is done manually, but the specific technique used is not mentioned.

Therefore, while the context provides information on data annotation in the deep learning pipeline, it does not explicitly mention the use of techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
