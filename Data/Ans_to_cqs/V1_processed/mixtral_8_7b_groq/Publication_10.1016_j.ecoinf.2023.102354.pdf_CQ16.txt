Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the specific context of drought characteristics. However, in general machine learning or deep learning models, training is often considered complete when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly. This indicates that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data and is not overfitting.

In the context of drought characteristics, the training process might involve learning a model to predict drought severity, duration, or intensity based on historical data. In this case, the training could be considered complete when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving, and the model generalizes well to unseen data.

It is important to note that the specific criteria used to determine training completion may vary depending on the problem at hand, the model architecture, and the data available. Therefore, it is always a good practice to monitor the model's performance on a validation set during the training process and use domain knowledge to determine when training is complete.
