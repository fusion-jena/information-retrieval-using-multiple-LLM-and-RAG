The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers in the pipeline. The focus of the text is on machine learning algorithms, particularly random forests and support vector machines, for inferring animal behavior from location and movement data. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
