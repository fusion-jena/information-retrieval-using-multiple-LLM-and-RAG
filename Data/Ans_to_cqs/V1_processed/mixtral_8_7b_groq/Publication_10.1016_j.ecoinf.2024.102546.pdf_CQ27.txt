Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer that the models were likely serialized and saved for later use, as is common practice in machine learning.

The context does provide information about the training of the models, including the use of data augmentation techniques such as color jitter, mosaic, random crop, and scale augmentation. The models were trained using the SGD optimizer and a warm-up + cosine decay learning rate schedule. The input image size was set to 800 x 800 pixels, and the batch size was 8.

Furthermore, the paper "Towards domain generalization in crop and weed segmentation for precision farming robots" mentions the use of a flowchart for cross-season weed detection, which suggests that the models were likely deployed in a real-world setting for precision farming.

Therefore, while the specifics of the deployment process are not provided, we can infer that the models were likely serialized, and then deployed in a real-world setting for precision farming using a flowchart for cross-season weed detection.
