The provided context does not contain information about the performance metrics of a deep learning model. The context focuses on the use of the Species Richness Index (SRI) as a metric to assess the accuracy of a database in depicting actual species richness in the field of marine fish species. The SRI is calculated as the ratio of the observed number of species (Sobs) to the expected number of species (Sexp) in each cell of the analyzed area. The SRI values are then categorized into three classes: low, medium, and high representativeness, based on their frequency distribution.

Therefore, I cannot provide information on the performance metrics of a deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall, as they are not mentioned in the given context.
