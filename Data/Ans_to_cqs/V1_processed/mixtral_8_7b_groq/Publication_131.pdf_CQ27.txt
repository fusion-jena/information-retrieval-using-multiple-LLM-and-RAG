The process of deploying the trained deep learning model, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier, involves several stages including model serialization and platform selection. 

Firstly, the CNN model is trained using a selected dataset in a cyber system, which is a workstation with an AMD Threadripper Pro 3955WX processor, 32 GB RAM, NVIDIA Quadro P620 GPU, and Windows 10 Pro. The training process involves selecting appropriate hyperparameters, such as the number of epochs and batch size, and using the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.001. The Keras library in Python is used for programming the stages of the classification system, including the data augmentation stage, where 10 additional audios are generated for each of the 865 audio samples in the database.

Once the CNN model is trained, it can be serialized and saved for later use. Model serialization involves converting the model architecture and weights into a file format that can be loaded and used for making predictions. In Keras, this can be achieved using the `model.save()` function, which saves the model architecture and weights to a single file. This file can then be loaded using the `keras.models.load_model()` function, which returns a model object that can be used for making predictions.

The deployed model can be used on different platforms depending on the application requirements. In this case, the trained CNN model can be deployed on the physical nodes or their digital twins for carrying out simulations or cooperative classifications. The cyber system is responsible for interacting with the final user (biologist) who orders new trainings of the CNNs and new updates of the trained CNNs on the physical nodes or their digital twins.

Therefore, the process of deploying the trained deep learning model involves model serialization and platform selection, which allows the trained model to be saved and used on different platforms for making predictions.
