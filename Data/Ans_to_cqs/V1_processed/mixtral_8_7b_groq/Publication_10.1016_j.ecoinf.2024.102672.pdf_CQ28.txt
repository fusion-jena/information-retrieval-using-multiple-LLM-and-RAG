The provided context does not contain information about the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the development and training of data-driven models, specifically machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, applied to freshwater ecosystems. It includes details about a study site, the creation of a new categorical binary variable for stratification, and the design of a classification model to detect if there existed stratification. The text also provides a table with the initial hyperparameters space and the results from the training and testing of the selected classification model for each set of variables. However, it does not mention any details about the deployment of the model on a specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
