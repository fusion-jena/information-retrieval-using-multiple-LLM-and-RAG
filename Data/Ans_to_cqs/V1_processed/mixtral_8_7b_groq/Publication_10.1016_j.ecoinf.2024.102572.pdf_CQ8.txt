Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various topics related to land use and land cover (LULC) data, forest fire point information, and greenhouse gas emissions associated with forests. It mentions different studies, researchers, and tools used in these areas, such as Sentinel-2 satellite photos, Google Earth Engine (GEE), and the Direct Application Programming Interface (API) in Python. However, it does not specify where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
