The provided context discusses various machine learning models and their respective parameters, but it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge in the field of deep learning, I can provide an answer to the query.

In deep learning pipelines, optimization techniques are crucial for training models effectively. Some commonly used optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Momentum, Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam.

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): SGD is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters by computing the gradient of the loss function for a single training example at a time. It is an extension of the standard gradient descent algorithm, which computes the gradient for the entire training dataset. SGD is computationally efficient and is suitable for large datasets.

2. Momentum: Momentum is an optimization technique that helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations in the irrelevant direction. It adds a fraction of the previous update's magnitude to the current update, making the updates more stable and smoother.

3. Adagrad: Adagrad is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each parameter in the model. It scales the learning rate for each parameter proportionally to the historical gradient magnitude. This makes Adagrad particularly useful for dealing with sparse data.

4. Adadelta: Adadelta is an extension of Adagrad that addresses the decaying learning rate issue. Instead of accumulating all past squared gradients, Adadelta restricts the window of accumulated past gradients, making the learning rate more stable.

5. RMSprop: RMSprop is an optimization algorithm that divides the learning rate by an exponentially decaying average of squared gradients. It is similar to Adagrad but has a decay factor for the historical gradient magnitude.

6. Adam: Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) is an optimization algorithm that combines ideas from Momentum and RMSprop. It estimates the first and second moments of the gradients and uses them to update the parameters. Adam is widely used in deep learning pipelines due to its robustness and efficiency.

While the provided context does not mention these optimization techniques explicitly, they are essential components of deep learning pipelines.
