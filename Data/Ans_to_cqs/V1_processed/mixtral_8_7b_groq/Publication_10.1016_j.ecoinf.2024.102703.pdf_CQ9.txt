Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text describes the materials and methods used in the research, including the use of the LASSO model for variable selection and statistical regularization, as well as the sampling sites in the Erhai watershed. However, it does not mention where the data repository is located. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
