The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The document describes a study that implemented deep learning-based models for tree detection in urban areas using a high spatial resolution dataset inside the Cerrado biome. However, it does not specify where the dataset or code used in the study are available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query. If the data repository is available on platforms like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, it would be beneficial to include this information in the paper for reproducibility and further research purposes.
