The provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (convolutional neural network or CNN). However, it is mentioned that deep learning models typically use hundreds of layered representations of data.

In general, deep learning models like CNNs have several hyperparameters that can be tuned to optimize the model's performance. Some common hyperparameters include:

1. Learning rate: This determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. A learning rate that is too high may cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, while a learning rate that is too low may cause the model to learn too slowly.
2. Number of layers and number of neurons per layer: These determine the complexity of the model and its capacity to learn.
3. Type of optimizer: This is the algorithm used to update the model's weights based on the gradient of the loss function. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.
4. Activation function: This is the function applied to the output of each neuron in the model. Common activation functions include the rectified linear unit (ReLU), sigmoid, and hyperbolic tangent (tanh).
5. Regularization techniques: These are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Common regularization techniques include L1 and L2 regularization.

It is important to note that the optimal hyperparameters for a given model can depend on the specific dataset and task at hand. Therefore, hyperparameter tuning is often an important step in the deep learning process.
