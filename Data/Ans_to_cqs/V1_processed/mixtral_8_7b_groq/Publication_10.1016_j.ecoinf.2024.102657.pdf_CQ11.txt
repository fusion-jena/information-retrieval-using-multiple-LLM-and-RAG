The provided context does not include information about the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the development of a deep learning pipeline called DialectDecoder for classifying bird songs based on their dialects, but it does not mention where the data used in the pipeline is stored or hosted. Therefore, I am unable to provide the link to the data repository.
