The provided context does not directly discuss deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness within them. However, it does mention the use of the R package ENMeval to detect the optimal settings for Maxent, a machine learning algorithm used for species distribution modeling. ENMeval uses cross-validation techniques to tune model parameters, which can help manage randomness in the modeling process.

In the context of machine learning, including deep learning, strategies for handling randomness include:

1. Initialization of weights: Neural networks typically initialize weights randomly. Using a fixed seed value ensures consistent weight initialization across multiple runs, reducing variability in the training process.
2. Data shuffling: Before each epoch, data is randomly shuffled to ensure that the model does not learn patterns specific to the order of the training data.
3. Regularization: Techniques like dropout, weight decay, and early stopping help prevent overfitting and reduce the impact of randomness on the model's performance.
4. Cross-validation: Splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, or using k-fold cross-validation, can help assess the model's performance and reduce the impact of randomness on the evaluation process.
5. Ensemble methods: Combining multiple models trained with different random initializations or subsets of the data can improve the overall performance and robustness of the model.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these strategies, they are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to handle randomness and improve model performance.
