The provided context discusses a specific deep learning model for image-to-image translation, focusing on its architecture, attention mechanisms, and loss functions. However, it does not directly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines is crucial for ensuring reproducibility and stability of training. Common strategies include:

1. **Fixed random seed value**: By setting a fixed random seed value, you can ensure that the random number generator used in various parts of the deep learning pipeline (e.g., data shuffling, weight initialization, dropout) produces the same sequence of random numbers. This helps in reproducing the same set of initial conditions and obtaining consistent results across multiple runs.

2. **Data shuffling**: Randomly shuffling the training dataset before each epoch can help prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well.

3. **Weight initialization**: Initializing model weights randomly is a common practice in deep learning. Different initialization strategies (e.g., Xavier initialization, He initialization) can help ensure that the model starts from a fair position and converges to the optimal solution.

4. **Dropout**: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out a fraction of the neurons during training. This helps prevent overfitting and encourages the model to learn more robust features.

5. **Batch normalization**: Batch normalization normalizes the activations of the previous layer for each mini-batch, reducing the internal covariate shift and making the network more stable during training.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these strategies, they are widely used in deep learning pipelines to handle randomness and improve model performance.
