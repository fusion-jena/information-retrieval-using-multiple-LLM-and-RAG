The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the authors used machine learning and deep learning models to forecast the percent disease incidence of Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD) under prevailing weather data. They employed multiple linear regression, machine learning (bootstrap forest, boosted tree), and deep learning (ANN) models and compared them for prediction accuracy.

In the context, it is mentioned that the authors used 80% of the data for training the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model, which is a type of artificial neural network (ANN). However, it is not explicitly stated how the data was split for train, test, and validation sets for the other deep learning models.

In general, for deep learning models, it is common to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Therefore, while the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not mentioned in the provided context, it is likely that the authors followed the common practice of splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets.
