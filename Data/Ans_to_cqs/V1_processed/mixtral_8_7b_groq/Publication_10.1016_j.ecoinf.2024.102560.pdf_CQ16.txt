The provided context does not contain specific information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context of machine learning or neural networks. However, it does mention the use of various software tools such as MATLAB and ArcGIS for data analysis and processing.

In general, there are several common criteria used to determine when training of a machine learning model is complete. One common approach is to monitor the validation loss during training and stop training when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model is overfitting to the training data. This is known as early stopping.

Another common approach is to use a pre-specified number of training epochs, or iterations over the training data. However, this approach can be less effective than early stopping, as it may result in underfitting or overfitting of the model.

Additionally, some models use techniques such as learning rate schedules or regularization to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance. These techniques can also be used in conjunction with early stopping or a fixed number of training epochs.

In summary, while the provided context does not contain specific information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete, common approaches include monitoring validation loss and using early stopping, a fixed number of training epochs, learning rate schedules, and regularization.
