In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as VAE. However, it is mentioned that the VAE model includes a series of operations for generating a sample from the model, which includes pre-processing. Therefore, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing is indeed involved.

In general, preprocessing steps for deep learning models can include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization is the process of scaling numeric data to a range of [0,1] or mean = 0, standard deviation = 1. Scaling involves adjusting the range of features to reduce the impact of outliers or to improve model performance. Cleaning refers to the process of handling missing or invalid data points.

In the context of the VAE model, it can be assumed that some form of preprocessing is applied to the satellite images before they are fed into the model. This could include normalization, scaling, and cleaning, depending on the specific requirements of the model and the nature of the data.

It is also worth noting that the VAE model includes an EfficientNet-based feature extractor that uses parameter tuning with the IKHO algorithm to enhance the prediction outcome for unseen data. This suggests that some form of feature engineering or extraction may be applied as part of the preprocessing step.

In summary, while the specific preprocessing steps for the VAE model are not mentioned in the provided context, it is likely that some form of normalization, scaling, and cleaning is applied to the satellite images before they are fed into the model. Additionally, feature engineering or extraction may be performed as part of the preprocessing step.
