The provided context does not give specific details about strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the setting of a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of certain techniques and methods that could indirectly involve handling randomness.

For instance, the context mentions the use of the Adam optimizer (Kingma & Ba, 2014) in the active learning iterations. The Adam optimizer is a stochastic optimization method that involves some degree of randomness, as it uses mini-batch gradients to update the model's weights and biases. The randomness in the mini-batch gradients helps the optimizer escape local minima and explore the weight space more effectively.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a grid search technique for hyperparameter tuning. Grid search involves evaluating the model's performance over a grid of hyperparameter values, which could include random seed values. By searching over a range of seed values, one could potentially identify the seed value that leads to the best model performance.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of deep metric learning (Thakur et al., 2019) for bioacoustic classification. Deep metric learning involves learning a distance metric in the embedding space that reflects the similarity between input data points. This process could involve some degree of randomness, as the model's weights and biases are updated based on mini-batch gradients.

Overall, while the provided context does not give explicit details about strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention techniques and methods that could indirectly involve handling randomness.
