The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance was evaluated on a test dataset after the training of the new layers was completed. The test dataset consisted of 70 videos, and the model evaluation on these videos was performed on 30 CPUs with an average frame rate of 17 frames per second. The evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance are not specified in the context.

Additionally, the authors mentioned that quantitative benchmarks are needed to validate the model's performance. This suggests that they were aware of the importance of monitoring the model's performance during training and planned to use quantitative metrics to assess its accuracy.

It is also worth noting that the authors used a pre-trained hummingbird model and fine-tuned it for their specific task. Fine-tuning a pre-trained model is a common strategy used in deep learning to improve the model's performance on a specific dataset. The authors could have monitored the model's performance during the fine-tuning process to ensure that it was learning the relevant features and not overfitting to the training data.

Overall, while the specific strategy used to monitor the model's performance during training is not explicitly stated in the context, it can be inferred that the authors evaluated the model's performance on a test dataset after training and planned to use quantitative benchmarks to validate its accuracy.
