Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating the use of a deep learning model in the research. The text focuses on the use of the Temporal Information Partitioning Network (TIPNet) approach for developing eco-hydrological process networks in a western Himalayan pine-dominated ecosystem. The approach is used to investigate the contributions of sub-daily scale variability in creating within-week variability and recognizing dominant causal hydrometeorological variability. The TIPNet approach is an information theory-based transfer entropy method, which has been used in studies for network generation at sub-hourly and sub-daily scales, providing robust results. However, the context does not mention any deep learning model being used for classification, segmentation, detection, or any other purpose.
