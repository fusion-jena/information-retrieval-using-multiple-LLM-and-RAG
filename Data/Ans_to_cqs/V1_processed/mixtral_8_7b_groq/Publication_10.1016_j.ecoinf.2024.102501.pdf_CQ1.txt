The context provided does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration. However, it can be inferred that sensors or measurement devices were used to gather water quality parameters, temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure data, as these variables are used as input for the models.

In the study by Chen et al. (2020), the dataset used for training and testing the models is listed in Table 1, but the context does not specify how this dataset was created or collected. Similarly, in the study by Heddam et al. (2022b), the authors used a dataset of DO concentration in a river, but the collection method is not mentioned.

In other studies, sensors or measurement devices are commonly used for collecting data in the deep learning pipeline for predicting DO concentration. For example, in the study by Areerachakul et al. (2013), the authors used a dataset of DO concentration in canals collected using a DO meter. In the study by Ay and Kisi (2012), the authors used a dataset of DO concentration in Foundation Creek, El Paso County, Colorado, collected using a YSI 6600 multi-parameter water quality sonde. In the study by O'Donncha et al. (2022), the authors used a dataset of water quality parameters, including DO concentration, collected using sensors deployed in a river.

Therefore, it can be concluded that sensors or measurement devices are commonly used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for predicting DO concentration. However, the context provided does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the studies related to predicting DO concentration.
