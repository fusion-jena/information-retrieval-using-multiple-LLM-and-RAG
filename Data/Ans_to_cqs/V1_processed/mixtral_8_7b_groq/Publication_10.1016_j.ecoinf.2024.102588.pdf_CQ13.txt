The provided context discusses the use of two deep learning models, the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model and the CNN model with an autoencoder, in the context of estimating aquatic ecosystem health indices. However, the text does not provide a comprehensive list of all the hyperparameters used in these models. Here is a list of some of the hyperparameters that are mentioned:

1. Learning rate: The learning rate for the CNN model was initially set to 0.001, but it was automatically adjusted to determine the optimum point for the best performance of the model. The learning rate for the SVM (Support Vector Machine) model was not specified.
2. Optimizer: The optimizer used for the CNN model was the Adam optimizer. The optimizer used for the SVM model was not specified.
3. Early stopping: The early stopping option was used to stop the model training at a specific epoch where the model validation accuracy could not be improved.
4. Loss function: The loss function used for the ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model was the mean squared error. The loss function used for the SVM and CNN models was not specified.
5. Hidden layers and nodes: The ANN model had six hidden layers with 128, 128, 256, 256, 512, and 512 nodes. The number of hidden layers and nodes for the CNN and CNN with autoencoder models were not specified.
6. Kernel function, C-parameter, and gamma: The SVM regression model used radial basis functions of 100 and 0.1 for the kernel function, C-parameter, and gamma, respectively.

It's important to note that the list of hyperparameters provided in the context is not exhaustive, and other hyperparameters may have been used in the deep learning models. Additionally, the hyperparameters used for the RF (Random Forest) model were not specified in the context.
