Based on the provided context, there is no information that a deep learning model, such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer, is used in the pipeline. The context discusses several machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with a linear kernel, K-nearest neighbors, and Decision Trees, but it does not mention any deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot confirm the use of a deep learning model in the pipeline.
