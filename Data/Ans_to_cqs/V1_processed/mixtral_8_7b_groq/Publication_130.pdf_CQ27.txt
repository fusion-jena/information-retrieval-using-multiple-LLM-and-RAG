The text provided does not give a detailed explanation of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the VGG19 CNN architecture was used and initialized with weights from a network pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. It also mentions that the model was trained using a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with a learning rate 10 times smaller than the original. The model was trained without freezing any of the layers of the network.

The text also mentions that the model was trained using a limited oversampling technique, where copies of the training data from the less sampled classes were created to mitigate overfitting. This was done because the training datasets were small.

It can be inferred that the model was likely saved or serialized in some way after training, as it is mentioned that the model could be updated similarly to the problem of changes in appearance discussed above. However, the text does not explicitly mention the platform or environment used for deployment.

In summary, while the text provides details about the training of the model, it does not give a comprehensive explanation of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The model was trained using the VGG19 CNN architecture, initialized with weights from a pre-trained network, and trained using a limited oversampling technique. It can be inferred that the model was saved or serialized after training, but the text does not provide information on the platform or environment used for deployment.
