Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, there is some information about the methodology used in the study, which could indirectly contribute to the generalizability of a model in a broader context.

Firstly, the study used a factor detector to assess the independent explanatory power of each driver in relation to the spatial variance in the kNDVI using the Q statistic. This approach allows for a better understanding of the relationship between the drivers and the kNDVI, which could help in developing a more generalizable model.

Secondly, the study compared the 90% quartiles of the Q values for all drivers at different spatial scales and selected the optimal sampling grid based on the criterion that the 90% quartile is the largest. This method could help in capturing the spatial variability of the data, which is crucial in developing a model that can generalize well to new data.

Lastly, the study used the CRediT authorship contribution statement, which lists the contributions of each author, including Zipeng Gu, who was responsible for the methodology, data curation, and conceptualization. This level of transparency in the methodology used in the study could help in replicating the study and developing a more generalizable model.

In summary, while there is no direct information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, the study's methodology, which includes using a factor detector, comparing Q values at different spatial scales, and providing transparency in the methodology used, could indirectly contribute to the generalizability of a model. However, without more information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
