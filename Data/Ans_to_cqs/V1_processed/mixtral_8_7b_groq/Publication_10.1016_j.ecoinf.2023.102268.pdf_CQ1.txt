The provided context does not give specific information about how the raw data was collected in the deep learning pipeline used in this study. The study focuses on the use of a deep learning model, ResNet-50, to extract features from spectrogram images of underwater sound data. These images were created from data segments extracted from an unfiltered waveform around detected signals. However, the context does not provide details on how the waveform data was originally collected, whether it was through surveys, sensors, public datasets, or other means. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given information.
