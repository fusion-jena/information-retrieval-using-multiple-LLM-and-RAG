The training data and the code used in the analysis of the deep learning model are published, but the context does not provide specific information about the data repository where they are available. It is mentioned that the data and code used in the study were published, along with the trained machine learning model, but the location of this publication is not specified. Common data repositories include Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF, but there is no mention of which one was used in this case. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific repository for the deep learning pipeline data.
