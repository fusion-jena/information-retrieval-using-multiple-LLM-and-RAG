The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on explaining the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence techniques, Neural Architecture Search, and transfer learning for optimizing model performance in ecological studies. It also mentions future work plans for model optimization and fine-tuning. However, there is no mention of where the code repository for this project is located. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
