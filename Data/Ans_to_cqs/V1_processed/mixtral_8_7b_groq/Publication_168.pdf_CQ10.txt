Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study titled "Forest Species Classification of UAV Hyperspectral Image Using Deep Learning." The authors, Jing Liang, Lu Han, Pengshuai Li, Hui Zhao, and Mingliang Qu, do not provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository in the given text.

The paper focuses on introducing a spectral-spatial pixel-wise convolutional neural network (SSPCNN) for forest species classification using hyperspectral images obtained from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The authors describe the architecture of the SSPCNN, including the input layer, convolutional layer, ReLU activation function, pooling layer, and fully connected layer. However, they do not share the actual implementation of the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in this study.
