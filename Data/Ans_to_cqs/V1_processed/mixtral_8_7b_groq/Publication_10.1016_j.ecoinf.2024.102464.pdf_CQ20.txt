The provided article does not contain information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. The focus of the article is on the comparison of seven machine learning models, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), for assessing the impact of urban development on species distribution. The authors used environmental data from the third and fourth natural environment surveys and calculated Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for each model before and after urban development. However, there is no mention of the hardware resources used for training the models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
