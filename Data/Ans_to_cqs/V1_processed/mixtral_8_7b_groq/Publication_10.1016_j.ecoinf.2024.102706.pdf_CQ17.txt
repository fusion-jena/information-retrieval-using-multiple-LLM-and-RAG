The provided context discusses the Elastic Net (Enet) regularization method, which is a combination of Lasso and Ridge regression, and is used to prevent overfitting in statistical models. However, it does not directly mention the regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines such as dropout and L2 regularization.

In the context, Lasso and Ridge regression are explained as regularization techniques that add penalty terms L1 and L2 respectively, to the sum of squared errors (SSE) in a model. Lasso regression (L1 penalty) removes predictors that do not affect reducing the SSE, while Ridge regression (L2 penalty) shrinks predictors. Elastic Net (Enet) aggregates L1 and L2 penalties and forms a linear regularization method. Enet has two parameters, alpha (Î±) and l1\_ratio, which control the regularization strength and the balance between L1 and L2 penalties, respectively.

On the other hand, dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used regularization techniques in deep learning pipelines. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages smaller weights, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.

In summary, while the provided context discusses the Elastic Net (Enet) regularization method, which is a combination of Lasso and Ridge regression, it does not directly mention the regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines such as dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used techniques in deep learning to prevent overfitting.
