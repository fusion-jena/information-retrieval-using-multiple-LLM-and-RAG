The provided context does not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of crowd-sourcing for obtaining manual annotation of karyotyping images of chromosomes, which can help in diverse data collection. Diverse data collection is a technique to reduce data bias by ensuring that the training data is representative of the entire population.

Sharma et al. (2017) demonstrated the efficacy of their method on karyotyping images of chromosomes by utilizing crowd-sourcing, involving non-expert users for obtaining manual annotation. This method helped in collecting diverse data, which can be useful in reducing data bias.

Moreover, the concept of adding a user interface for easily marking desired components or the development of a more specific detector can also help in collecting diverse data. This can enable experts to manually annotate and include specific components that may have been underrepresented in the original data collection.

In addition, the use of deep learning-based models for identifying branches and crossing points in 3D volumetric images, as proposed by Guo et al. (2021), can also help in reducing data bias. By extracting spherical patches around points of interest and using a deep learning-based model to classify the point of interest, this method can ensure that all potential points of interest are analyzed, regardless of their initial representation in the training data.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling, it does discuss the importance of diverse data collection and the use of deep learning-based models for identifying underrepresented components in the training data.
