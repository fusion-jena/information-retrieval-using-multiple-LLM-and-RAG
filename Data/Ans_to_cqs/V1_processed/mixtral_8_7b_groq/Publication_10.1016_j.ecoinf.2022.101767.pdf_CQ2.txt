Based on the provided context, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline consist of video and CSV formats.

In the study, the researchers analyzed videos displaying wild birds to extract data from thumbnail characteristics. These characteristics were classified into six categories, including people, birds, objects, scenery, text, and food. Objects that were identified in the videos were either a camera or binoculars. Each thumbnail category was recorded as a separate column in a CSV file, with a value of 0 or 1 in each category column.

Therefore, the data used in this study consisted of video files of wild birds and a CSV file containing the extracted thumbnail characteristics. The CSV file was used as the input data format for the deep learning pipeline, while the video files were used for data extraction.

It is worth noting that the study did not mention the use of audio or image data formats. However, the researchers used R software version 4.1.2 with various packages such as Boruta, lmerTest, car, MuMIn, and randomForest for data analysis. These packages are commonly used for statistical analysis and machine learning tasks, including image and audio data analysis. Therefore, it is possible that the researchers used additional data formats in their deep learning pipeline, but this information was not provided in the context.

In summary, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline in this study consisted of video and CSV formats. The video files were used for data extraction, and the CSV file was used as the input data format for the deep learning pipeline.
