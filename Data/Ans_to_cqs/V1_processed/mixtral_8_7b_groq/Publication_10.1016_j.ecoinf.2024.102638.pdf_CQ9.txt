After reviewing the given context, I was unable to find information regarding the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several research papers and details about the methodology used in those studies, but it does not mention where the data used in the deep learning pipeline is stored or hosted. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.

The papers cited in the context include "Deep learning and process understanding for data-driven earth system science" by Reichstein et al. (2019), "On the temporal upscaling of evapotranspiration from instantaneous remote sensing measurements to 8-day mean daily-sums" by Ryu et al. (2012), and "L-band radiative properties of vine vegetation at the MELBEX III SMOS cal/val site" by Schwank et al. (2012). While these papers discuss the use of various machine learning algorithms, such as KNN, GP, TREE, RF, XGB, SVR, MLP, and others, they do not provide information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I recommend contacting the authors of the papers or the researchers involved in the deep learning pipeline to inquire about the data repository. They may be able to provide more information about where the data is stored and how it can be accessed.
