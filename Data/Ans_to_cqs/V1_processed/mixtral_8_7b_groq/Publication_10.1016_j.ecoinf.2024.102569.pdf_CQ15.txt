The provided context does not discuss the optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. However, it does describe a method for estimating parameters in a statistical model using the gradient ascent method.

Gradient ascent is an optimization algorithm used to find the maximum of a function by iteratively moving in the direction of the gradient of the function. In the context provided, the gradient ascent method is used to compute the L1 penalized estimates of the parameters in a model using a penalized loss function with an L1 penalty.

On the other hand, deep learning optimization algorithms like SGD and Adam are used to train deep learning models by minimizing a loss function. These algorithms are designed to handle the large number of parameters in deep learning models and the large amount of data used to train them.

SGD is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. It is an iterative algorithm that processes the training data in small batches, computing the gradient of the loss function for each batch and updating the parameters accordingly.

Adam is a more advanced optimization algorithm that combines the ideas of momentum and adaptive learning rates. It maintains an exponentially decaying average of past gradients and squared gradients, which are used to compute the adaptive learning rates for each parameter.

In summary, while the provided context discusses the use of the gradient ascent method for computing L1 penalized estimates in a statistical model, it does not mention the optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines such as SGD and Adam.
