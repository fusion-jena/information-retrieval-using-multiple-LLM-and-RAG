The provided context discusses the use of a deep learning model that combines a deep neural network (DNN) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) block for pest monitoring. However, the specific hyperparameters used in this model, such as the learning rate or optimizer, are not explicitly mentioned.

The context does mention that the model was implemented in Python using TensorFlow and Scikit-learn libraries. TensorFlow provides various options for hyperparameters, such as learning rate, optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD), number of layers, number of neurons per layer, batch size, and more. The choice of these hyperparameters would depend on the specific problem and dataset being used.

Furthermore, the context highlights the use of the Pseudo-Bayesian Parameter (PBP) method, which is an improvement over current state-of-the-art machine learning tools for pest monitoring. The PBP method provides interpretability by assigning clear interpretations to each hyperparameter. However, the specific hyperparameters associated with the DNN-LSTM model are not specified.

Therefore, while the context provides valuable information about the deep learning model used for pest monitoring, the specific hyperparameters used in the model are not explicitly mentioned.
