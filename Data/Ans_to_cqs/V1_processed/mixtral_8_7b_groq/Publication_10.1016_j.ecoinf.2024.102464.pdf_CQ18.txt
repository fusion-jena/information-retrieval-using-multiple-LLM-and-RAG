The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves conducting a correlation analysis of the variables before model implementation and focusing on species that are comparatively more difficult to monitor. This approach aims to enhance the predictive performance of the model and mitigate the risk of overfitting.

The correlation analysis of the variables helps in identifying and eliminating redundant or highly correlated features that may negatively impact the model's performance during training. By doing so, the model can better learn the underlying patterns in the data, leading to improved accuracy and robustness.

Furthermore, the strategy focuses on monitoring species that are harder to track, which is a crucial aspect of conservation area priorities and endangered species management. By analyzing the species distribution model results, the method proposed in the study can overcome the limitations of the Incidence Function Model (IFM) and provide more accurate and reliable predictions for these species.

The Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves in Fig. 3 also serve as a tool to monitor the model performance during training. The true positive rate (sensitivity) and false positive rate (1-specificity) quantify the proportion of correctly and incorrectly classified samples, respectively. The red and blue curves represent the mean area under the curve (AUC) of training and test data, providing a visual representation of the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.

In summary, the strategy to monitor the model performance during training includes conducting a correlation analysis of the variables, focusing on harder-to-monitor species, and utilizing ROC curves to assess the model's accuracy and reliability. This comprehensive approach ensures that the model is effectively trained and can provide valuable insights for conservation area priorities and endangered species management.
