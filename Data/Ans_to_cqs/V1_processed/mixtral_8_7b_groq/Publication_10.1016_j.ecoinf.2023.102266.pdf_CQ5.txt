The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context focuses on the development of a model for predicting real-world phenomena, such as wildfire spreads or pest plants propagation, using a classification model based on the Monte Carlo method.

The model's limitations as a classification model are discussed, including the need for an ample number of tests to attain an adequate level of result confidence and the importance of determining the range of values for partitions, C, and p0 based on the environmental phenomenon and its location.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
