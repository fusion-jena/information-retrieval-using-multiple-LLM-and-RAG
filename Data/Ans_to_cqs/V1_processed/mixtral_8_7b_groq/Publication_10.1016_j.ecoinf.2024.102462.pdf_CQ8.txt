Unfortunately, there is no information provided in the given context about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes details about various studies and applications of deep learning, but it does not mention where the code for these pipelines is available. It is possible that the code was not shared publicly, or it may be hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.
