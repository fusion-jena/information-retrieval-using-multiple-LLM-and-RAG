The provided context does not give specific information on how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. There is no mention of methods such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization techniques. The text focuses on describing the models used, the datasets, and the performance evaluation metrics. It explains that Random Forests (RFs), Generalized Boosted Models (GBMs), Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were used, and it gives details about the configuration of these models. However, it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
