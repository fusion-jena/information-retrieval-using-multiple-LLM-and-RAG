Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of image preprocessing techniques such as image inversion using the OpenCV library and creating a required data structure for moving images and labels to corresponding folders for training, testing, and validation. However, it does not mention any techniques specifically aimed at addressing data bias.

Techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are commonly used to address data bias. Stratified sampling ensures that the train and test datasets have approximately the same percentage of samples of each target variable. Oversampling involves increasing the number of samples from the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of samples from the majority class. Diverse data collection focuses on gathering data from various sources and ensuring representation from different demographics or groups to avoid bias.

Without further information, it is not possible to determine if any of these techniques were applied during the data preprocessing phase for this particular deep learning pipeline.
