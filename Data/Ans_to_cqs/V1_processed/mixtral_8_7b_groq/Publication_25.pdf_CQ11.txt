The data and code for the deep learning pipeline are publicly available in two repositories. The data can be accessed through the NEON Data Portal, which can be found at <http://data.neonscience.org/>. This portal provides access to all the data used in the project. On the other hand, the code for the project is available on GitHub at <https://github.com/weecology/DeepLidar> and has been archived on Zenodo with the identifier [18]. These repositories provide the necessary resources to replicate the study, customize the model to a local geographic area, and explore the potential of deep learning-based approaches for large-scale actionable information on natural systems.

It is worth noting that the challenge of applying deep learning to natural systems is the need for large training datasets. The spatial extent of training data often prohibits the field-based verification of annotated objects, and the high variation in tree crown appearance increases the risk of overfitting when using small amounts of training data. To address this limitation, the study explores the use of self-supervised learning, which uses unsupervised methods to generate training data that is used to train supervised models. This approach has been applied to remote sensing for hyperspectral image classification and can be combined with labeled data in a semi-supervised framework, which may improve deep learning on limited training data.

In addition, the availability of hyperspectral data could assist in dividing the 'tree' class into multiple species labels, providing additional insights into the economic value, ecological habitat, and carbon storage capacity for large geographic areas. While further work is needed to understand the best way to combine data among scales and sensors, the study demonstrates the potential of deep learning-based approaches for large-scale actionable information on natural systems.
