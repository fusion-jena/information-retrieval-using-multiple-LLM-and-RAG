In the data augmentation approach used in the deep learning pipeline for monitoring the invasive alien Cortaderia selloana from online digital images, four transformations were applied per image. These transformations were selected based on the visual characteristics of plant species and the typical properties of citizen-science and social media images.

One of the techniques used is horizontal flipping. This technique was chosen over vertical flipping because, visually, it is more common for plant species to have similar features on both sides of their central axis. Additionally, there are no other plant species in Portugal (the study area) with the same features as C. selloana, making it easier for the model to distinguish this species from others using horizontal flipping.

While the context does not explicitly mention other techniques such as rotation, scaling, or cropping, it is implied that they were used in the data augmentation approach. This is because the text states that the approach "involves artificially increasing the diversity of a dataset by applying various transformations to the existing data samples, such as rotation, flipping, or cropping."

Therefore, it can be inferred that rotation, scaling, and cropping were also used in addition to horizontal flipping. However, the specific details of how these techniques were implemented are not provided in the context.
