The context provided does not specify the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of honey bee flight activity data in the study, but it does not provide information on where this data can be accessed or replicated. The article refers to the Ecological Informatics journal and ScienceDirect as sources of information, but there is no direct link to a data repository in the given text. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.

The context does mention the journal homepage (www.elsevier.com/locate/ecolinf) and the article title "Using honey bee flight activity data and a deep learning model as a toxicovigilance tool" by Olivares-Pinto et al. (2024), which could potentially be used to contact the authors or the journal and inquire about the data repository. However, this information goes beyond the provided context and is not a direct answer to the query.

In general, it is good practice for scientific studies to provide information on data availability and access, as this promotes transparency and reproducibility. However, this information may not always be included in the main text of the article, and further investigation may be required to locate the data repository.
