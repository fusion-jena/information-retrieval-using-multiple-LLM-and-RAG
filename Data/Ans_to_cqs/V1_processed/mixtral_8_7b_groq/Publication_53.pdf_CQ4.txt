The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include flipping, lighting adjustment, and zooming. Specifically, vertical flipping of images (flip\_vert = TRUE) was used to increase the diversity of the training data and help the model generalize better. The maximum lighting was limited to 0.02 (max\_lighting = 0.02) to prevent overexposure of the images. Zooming augmentation was disabled (max\_zoom = 1), and a fixed value of 0.02 was used for lighting adjustment to prevent overfitting. Additionally, the fastai get\_transforms function was used to apply these data augmentation techniques during training. These techniques helped improve the model's performance and reduce overfitting by increasing the variability of the training data.
