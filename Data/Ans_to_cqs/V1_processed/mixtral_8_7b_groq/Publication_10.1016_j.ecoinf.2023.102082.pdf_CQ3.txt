Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that some form of image annotation was likely used during the development of the Lang10m high-resolution CHM of the Earth, as this product was created using Sentinel-2 optical images and a deep learning approach involving convolutional neural networks.

In the context of remote sensing and geospatial analysis, image annotation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in an image. It is a simple and efficient way to label objects in an image, and it is often used for object detection tasks.
2. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves dividing an image into multiple regions, where each region corresponds to a specific class or object. It is a more detailed form of image annotation than bounding box annotation, as it provides pixel-level information about the location and extent of objects in an image.
3. Instance segmentation: This technique is similar to semantic segmentation, but it also distinguishes between individual instances of objects within the same class. It is a more complex form of image annotation than semantic segmentation, as it requires identifying and separating individual objects within an image.

Given that the Lang10m product is a high-resolution canopy height model, it is possible that some form of semantic or instance segmentation was used to annotate the Sentinel-2 images. This would allow the deep learning model to accurately identify and classify different objects within the images, such as trees, buildings, and other features. However, without explicit information from the context, it is not possible to confirm the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
