The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of grid search, random search, or any other specific techniques for hyperparameter optimization. However, it does describe a process for optimizing the spatial scale and discretization parameters of the model.

To determine the optimal spatial scale, the authors compared the 90% quartiles of the Q values for all drivers at different grid scales (1 km * 1 km, 2 km * 2 km, 3 km * 3 km, 4 km * 4 km, 5 km * 5 km, and 6 km * 6 km) and selected the scale with the largest 90% quartile. This analysis revealed that the optimal spatial scale for the model was 2 km * 2 km.

To optimize the discretization parameters, the authors used the "optidisc" function of the "GD" package in RStudio to select the optimal parameters for discretizing continuous data. They found that as the grid scale increased, the 90% quantile of the Q-values for each driver reached its maximum at the 2 km * 2 km grid scale, followed by a decreasing trend. They also calculated the Q values for the continuous data sample points collected at the 2 km * 2 km scale and compared the changes in the Q values with different discretization parameters. They found that with an increase in the number of sample points, the Q-values initially increased significantly and then gradually stabilized, suggesting that the number of discretization intervals was sufficient to fully explain the spatial differentiation of the dependent variable.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search, it does describe a process for optimizing the spatial scale and discretization parameters of the model.
