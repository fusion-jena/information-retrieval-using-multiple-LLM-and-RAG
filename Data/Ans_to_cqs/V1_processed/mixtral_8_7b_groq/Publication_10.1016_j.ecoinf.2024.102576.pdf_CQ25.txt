The deep learning model, as described in the context, is used for the purpose of classification. Specifically, it is used for land-cover classification based on satellite imagery. The model is trained using a methodology determined by the labeling process, and it uses the results of previous steps in the form of PSI (Primary Sampling Units) with specific spatial resolution, spectral band, interval, and chronological order. Once trained, this model can classify new PSI data based on the target PSI. Furthermore, if satellite imagery accumulates over time due to continuous satellite observations, the PSI can be continuously generated, and the model can perform ongoing classification, enabling PCF (Periodic Change Flow) land monitoring.

The deep learning model in use is the U-Net model, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) that performs classification through supervised learning. The U-Net model requires labeled data for its applications, which is a challenge in the context of North Korea, where no official land-cover map based on national-scale field data exists. However, researchers have found ways to classify elements based on phenological characteristics even in the absence of specific classes.

The deep learning model's effectiveness in classification has been demonstrated by Kim et al. (2021a), who showed that the classification accuracy and performance improved as data increased during the training of a deep learning model using satellite imagery over multiple periods. Therefore, the characteristics of a deep-learning model can be used effectively for land-cover classification in North Korea.

In summary, the deep learning model's purpose is to classify land-cover based on satellite imagery, specifically for PCF land monitoring. The U-Net model, a type of CNN, is used for this classification, and its effectiveness has been demonstrated in the context of North Korea, where official land-cover maps are not available.
