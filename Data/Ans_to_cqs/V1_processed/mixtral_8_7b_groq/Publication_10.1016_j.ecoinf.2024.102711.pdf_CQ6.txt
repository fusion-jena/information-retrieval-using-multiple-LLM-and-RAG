In the context provided, there is a specific focus on AutoML libraries, particularly AutoGluon, and their role in training machine learning models. However, the text does mention some data pre-processing techniques that are used as part of the AutoGluon library's core strategy. These techniques can also be applied to deep learning models.

AutoGluon, an open-source AutoML library, automates several steps in the machine learning pipeline, including data pre-processing. While the text does not explicitly mention normalization, scaling, or cleaning in the context of pre-processing for a deep learning model, it does refer to "advanced data processing" and "data pre-processing" as part of AutoGluon's approach. 

Moreover, the text specifically mentions automating feature engineering, which can involve normalization and scaling. Feature engineering is the process of creating new features or modifying existing features to improve model performance. Techniques such as normalization and scaling can be considered part of this process, as they are often used to transform features to make them more suitable for machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models.

Normalization is the process of rescaling numeric variables to a common range, often between 0 and 1. This can be important in deep learning models, as different features may have different scales, which could potentially bias the learning process. Scaling, on the other hand, involves rescaling numeric variables without necessarily restricting the range, often to improve the optimization process in gradient-based learning algorithms.

Cleaning, another pre-processing step, involves handling missing values, outliers, and other forms of data corruption. While the text does not explicitly mention data cleaning, it is an essential step in preparing data for any machine learning model, including deep learning models.

Therefore, while the text does not explicitly mention normalization, scaling, and cleaning in the context of pre-processing for a deep learning model, these steps can be inferred as part of the "advanced data processing" and "data pre-processing" strategies employed by AutoGluon.
