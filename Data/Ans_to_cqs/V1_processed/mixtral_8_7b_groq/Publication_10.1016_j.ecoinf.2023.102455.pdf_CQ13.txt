The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models mentioned in the context include:

1. CNN-BiGRU model:
- CNN Layers: 2
- Filters: 64
- Kernel size: [1,4]
- BiGRU Layers: 1
- BiGRU neurons: 30
- Optimizer: Adam
- Activation function: 'relu'
- Epochs: 43
- Batch size: 32
- Learning rate: 0.000455
- Dense: 100

2. KELM model:
- Regularization coefficient: 3E+05
- Kernel parameter: 7000

3. RVFL model:
- Number of nodes: 20
- Regularization parameter: 0.2
- Weight random range: [1,1]
- Bias random range: [0,1]

4. MVMD-CNN-BiRNN model:
- CNN Layers: 2
- Filters: 64
- Kernel size: [1,4]
- BiRNN Layers: 1
- BiRNN neurons: 30
- Optimizer: Adam
- Activation function: 'relu'
- Epochs: 200
- Batch size: 32
- Learning rate: 0.0002
- Dense: 100

Additionally, the context also mentions that all inputs and target parameters are normalized between 0 and 1 using the formula:

Xnorm = (X - Xmin) / (Xmax - Xmin)

where Xmin and Xmax are the minimum and maximum values of the input data.

The KELM model has two hyperparameters, namely gamma and C, while the RVFL model has hyperparameters such as the number of nodes, regularization parameter, weight random range, and bias random range.

Overall, the hyperparameters used in these deep learning models are crucial in determining the performance of the models in forecasting the streamflow in Bear and Winter Rivers of PEI.
