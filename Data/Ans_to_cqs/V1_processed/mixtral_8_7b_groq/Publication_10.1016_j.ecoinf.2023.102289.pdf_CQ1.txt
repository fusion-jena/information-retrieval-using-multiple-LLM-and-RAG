The provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline of LaDeco. However, it does mention that LaDeco uses pre-trained models for semantic segmentation, which suggests that the raw data used for training these models likely comes from labeled image datasets.

In the context of semantic segmentation for landscape analysis, public datasets such as the Places dataset (Zhou et al., 2018a) and the ADE20k dataset (Zhou et al., 2018b) are commonly used for training deep learning models. The Microsoft COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014) is another large-scale dataset that provides segmentation annotations for various objects and scenes.

Additionally, researchers may collect their own image datasets through methods such as surveys or sensors. For example, Kolhar and Jagtap (2021) used a convolutional neural network-based encoder-decoder architecture for semantic segmentation of plants, and they collected their own dataset of plant images. Similarly, Li et al. (2015) developed a modified green view index to assess street-level urban greenery using Google Street View images.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the LaDeco pipeline, it is likely that a combination of public datasets and custom-collected datasets are used for training the pre-trained semantic segmentation models.
