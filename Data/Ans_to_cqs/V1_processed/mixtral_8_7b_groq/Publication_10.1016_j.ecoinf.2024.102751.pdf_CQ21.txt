After model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be involved, such as calculating metrics, creating saliency maps, and generating a confusion matrix. However, based on the provided context, the specific postprocessing steps mentioned are the calculation of model metrics and the use of the 'yardstick' package for R to compute them.

The 'yardstick' package for R was used to calculate three specific model parameters: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2). RMSE measures the standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors); it represents the difference between values predicted by a model and the values actually observed. MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors in predictions without considering their direction. R2 represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

The model used in the context is a gamma distribution with a natural logarithm as the linking function. This choice was made due to the skewed distribution of the modeled variable, Volumetric Water Content (VWC).

It is important to note that other postprocessing steps, such as creating saliency maps or generating a confusion matrix, are not mentioned in the provided context. Saliency maps are a way to visualize the importance of each input feature in the prediction made by a model. A confusion matrix, on the other hand, is a table used to describe the performance of a classification model on a set of test data for which the true values are known.

In summary, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after model training include the calculation of specific model metrics, namely RMSE, MAE, and R2, using the 'yardstick' package for R. Other postprocessing steps, such as creating saliency maps or generating a confusion matrix, are not mentioned.
