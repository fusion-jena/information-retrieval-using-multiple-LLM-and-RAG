In the deep learning pipeline, data annotation techniques are crucial for training models to accurately recognize and categorize objects or regions of interest within images. Two common annotation techniques used in deep learning are bounding box annotation and instance segmentation.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing a rectangle around an object of interest in an image, with the rectangle's coordinates specifying the object's location. This technique is often used in object detection tasks, where the goal is to identify the presence and location of specific objects within an image. Bounding box annotation is relatively simple and efficient, making it a popular choice for large-scale annotation projects. However, it may not always provide precise object boundaries, which can impact model performance in tasks requiring detailed object delineation.

Instance segmentation, on the other hand, involves labeling each pixel within an image to indicate the specific object it belongs to, providing a more precise object boundary than bounding box annotation. This technique is often used in semantic segmentation tasks, where the goal is to classify each pixel within an image into predefined categories. Instance segmentation can be more computationally intensive and time-consuming than bounding box annotation, but it can provide more accurate results, especially in applications requiring detailed object delineation.

In the context of remote sensing and geospatial analysis, instance segmentation has been used in applications such as semantic segmentation of high-resolution UAV imagery for plant species and community identification (Kattenborn et al., 2019a). In this study, the UNet model, a popular convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for biomedical image segmentation, was adapted for use in remote sensing applications. The UNet model uses skip connections between encoder and decoder layers, allowing for precise object boundary delineation.

CNNs have demonstrated strong performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation (He et al., 2016; Szegedy et al., 2015). CNNs typically employ simple data partitioning strategies, such as training, validation, and testing, to add heterogeneous information to the training procedure (Ocer et al., 2020). However, as noted in the provided context, limitations in training domain heterogeneity can impact model performance.

In summary, bounding box annotation and instance segmentation are two common data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Bounding box annotation is simple and efficient, making it suitable for large-scale annotation projects, while instance segmentation provides more precise object boundaries, making it suitable for applications requiring detailed object delineation. In remote sensing and geospatial analysis, instance segmentation has been used in applications such as plant species and community identification using high-resolution UAV imagery.
