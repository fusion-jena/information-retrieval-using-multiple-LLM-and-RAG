Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in the study by Dae-Seong Lee et al. uses primarily CSV data format.

The researchers developed a dataset consisting of seven environmental variables, including geographical variables (elevation, slope, and distance to road) and meteorological variables (annual mean temperature, minimum temperature in January, maximum temperature in July, and annual precipitation). They also included the proportion of land-use types in seven categories (urban area, agriculture land, forest, grassland, wetland, barren area, and water). All of these values were extracted from digital maps using the geographic information system (GIS) program (ArcGIS 10.1; ESRI). Digital maps for elevation and slope were obtained from the National Geographic Information Institute of Korea.

Therefore, the data used in this deep learning pipeline is in the form of a CSV file, which contains the values of the environmental variables and the proportion of land-use types for each location. The study aimed to predict the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease based on these environmental factors in South Korea using machine learning algorithms.
