The provided context does not contain information about the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the model. It discusses the detection of ungulate vocalizations, including cows and deer, using a model with a larger FFT window size and cow-specific parameters. The model's performance is compared to other studies, but the underlying framework for building the model is not mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
