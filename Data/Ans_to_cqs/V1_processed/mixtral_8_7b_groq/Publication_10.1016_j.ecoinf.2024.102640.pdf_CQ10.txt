I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of SegFormer, a Transformer-based model for semantic segmentation in GreenCam, but it does not mention the code repository or its location. Therefore, I am unable to provide the link to the code repository.
