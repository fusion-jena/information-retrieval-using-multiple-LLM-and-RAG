The provided context does not contain specific information about the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the study by Huang et al., 2019. However, in general, accuracy, precision, and recall are commonly used metrics to evaluate the performance of deep learning models in remote sensing and land-use studies.

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. It is a common metric used to evaluate the overall performance of a model.

Precision, also known as positive predictive value, is the ratio of true positives (correctly predicted positive samples) to the total number of predicted positives (true positives + false positives). It measures the exactness of the model in predicting positive samples.

Recall, also known as sensitivity, is the ratio of true positives to the total number of actual positives (true positives + false negatives). It measures the completeness of the model in predicting positive samples.

In addition to these metrics, other metrics such as F1-score, specificity, and Cohen's kappa coefficient can also be used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the study by Huang et al., 2019 may have used one or more of these metrics to evaluate the performance of their deep learning model in monitoring ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen. However, without explicit information from the study, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
