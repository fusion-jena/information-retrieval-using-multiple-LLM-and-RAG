The deep learning model used in the pipeline described in the text is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Faster-RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) backbone. Specifically, the authors used a NASnet architecture, which is a type of CNN that uses Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find the optimal architecture for a given task.

The NASnet architecture was chosen because it has been shown to be effective in object detection tasks, and the authors were interested in detecting and classifying sharks in underwater images. The Faster-RCNN backbone was used because it is a well-established and effective method for object detection, which involves identifying and locating objects within an image.

To summarize, the deep learning model used in the pipeline described in the text is a NASnet architecture with a Faster-RCNN backbone, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that has been shown to be effective in object detection tasks.
