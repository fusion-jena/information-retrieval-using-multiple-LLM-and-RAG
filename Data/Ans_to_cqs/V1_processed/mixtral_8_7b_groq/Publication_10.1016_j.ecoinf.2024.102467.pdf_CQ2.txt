Deep learning models can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and structured data like CSV files.

Images are commonly used in deep learning applications, particularly in computer vision tasks such as object detection, image classification, and semantic segmentation. Image data can be in various formats, including JPEG, PNG, and BMP. Before feeding image data into a deep learning model, it is often preprocessed, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation, to improve model performance.

Audio data is used in deep learning models for tasks such as speech recognition, natural language processing, and music information retrieval. Audio data can be in various formats, including WAV, MP3, and FLAC. Before feeding audio data into a deep learning model, it is often preprocessed, including feature extraction, normalization, and data augmentation.

Video data is used in deep learning models for tasks such as video action recognition, object detection in video, and video segmentation. Video data is typically a sequence of images, and preprocessing involves extracting frames from the video and applying image preprocessing techniques.

Structured data, such as CSV files, are used in deep learning models for tasks such as regression, classification, and time series forecasting. Structured data is typically preprocessed by cleaning, normalizing, and encoding categorical variables before feeding it into a deep learning model.

In summary, deep learning models can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and structured data like CSV files. Before feeding data into a deep learning model, it is often preprocessed, including resizing, normalization, feature extraction, and data augmentation, to improve model performance.
