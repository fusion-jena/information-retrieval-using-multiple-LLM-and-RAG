The provided context does not contain specific information about the regularization methods used in the deep learning pipelines for fauna and flora detection. However, it does mention the use of pre-trained weights from the Microsoft COCO dataset for the region proposal network (RPN) classifier and mask head in the D-Mask R-CNN architecture. This suggests that transfer learning, a regularization technique, is being used.

In transfer learning, a pre-trained model is used as a starting point for a new, related task, instead of training a model from scratch. This can help to reduce overfitting by providing a good initial set of weights, and by reducing the number of training examples needed to achieve a good performance.

Additionally, the authors mention the use of a feature fusion module, which combines the extracted features from both backbones using one 3 × 3 convolution per FPN scale and reduces the number of channels from 2 × 256 to 256. This can also be seen as a form of regularization, as it helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.

As for other regularization methods such as dropout, L2 regularization, data augmentation, etc, the context does not provide information on whether they are used or not.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the use of regularization methods such as dropout, L2 regularization, etc, it does suggest that transfer learning and feature fusion are being used as regularization techniques in the deep learning pipeline for fauna and flora detection.
