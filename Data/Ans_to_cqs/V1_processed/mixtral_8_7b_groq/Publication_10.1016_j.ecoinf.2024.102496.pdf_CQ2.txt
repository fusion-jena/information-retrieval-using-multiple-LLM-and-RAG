The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that a geodatabase is available as a map package to download, which suggests that spatial data formats such as shapefiles or GeoJSON may be used. Additionally, it mentions that researchers and spatial analysts may want to customize the data, which implies that the data is in a format that can be manipulated using programming or GIS software. The context also mentions a figure showing color-coded census tracts, which suggests that tabular data (e.g., CSV) may be used to represent demographic information. However, it does not explicitly mention image, audio, or video data formats.

It is worth noting that the context is focused on environmental justice and green infrastructure, and does not mention deep learning specifically. Therefore, it is possible that the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline for this research are not mentioned in the provided context.
