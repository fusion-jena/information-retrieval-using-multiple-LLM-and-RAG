Unfortunately, there is no information provided in the context about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The context includes details about the active learning framework, the ResNet-34 model with pre-trained weights, and the training dataset used for the study. However, it does not mention the specific location of the code repository, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
