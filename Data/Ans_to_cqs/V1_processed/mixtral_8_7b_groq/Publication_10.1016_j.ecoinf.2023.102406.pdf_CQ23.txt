Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of a deep learning model being used. However, I can still provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the modeling techniques used in the study.

To ensure the generalizability of the models, the study employed several techniques. First, they used a diverse dataset for modeling. Although the context does not explicitly state that the dataset was diverse in terms of data sources, it does mention that the study considered species characteristics and responses to the environment. This suggests that the dataset included a variety of species, which can help improve the model's ability to generalize to new species.

Second, the study used accuracy metrics on separate testing data or withheld known classes to determine how well the classifier assigned classes using predictor variables. This is a standard practice in modeling, as it allows for an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance. The testing data represented 25% of the samples, which is a commonly used split for training and testing models.

Third, the study used a randomly sampled split to create the testing data, which is a form of stratified splitting. Stratified splitting ensures that each subset of the data (in this case, the training and testing sets) contains a representative proportion of the classes present in the original dataset. This can help improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Finally, the study used automated tuning for parameters through resampling and standard default values to reach the most accurate final model configuration. This technique can help ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data, which can improve its ability to generalize to new data.

While the context does not mention cross-validation explicitly, it does mention that multiple methods may be applied to detect overlapping outcomes. Cross-validation is one such method that can help improve the model's ability to generalize to new data by repeatedly training and testing the model on different subsets of the data.

In summary, while there is no explicit mention of a deep learning model being used in the study, the study employed several techniques to ensure the generalizability of the modeling techniques used. These techniques include using a diverse dataset, evaluating the model on separate testing data, using a randomly sampled split to create the testing data, and using automated tuning for parameters through resampling. Additionally, while not explicitly mentioned, cross-validation may have also been used as a method to detect overlapping outcomes.
