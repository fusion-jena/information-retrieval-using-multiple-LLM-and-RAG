The provided context discusses the metadata and documentation standards for marine imaging in biological studies, but it does not directly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning and the nature of the discussed metadata, we can make some educated guesses about the data formats used.

In the context of marine imaging, the most relevant data format is likely to be images, as the metadata and documentation standards focus on camera settings, image resolutions, and image curation. Deep learning pipelines often use image data in the form of high-resolution photographs or video frames for tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, or classification. Common image file formats include JPEG, PNG, and TIFF, although some deep learning frameworks might prefer specific formats like PNG for better compatibility.

Additionally, the context mentions some metadata fields related to time (UTC), location (longitude, latitude, depth, meters above ground), and camera settings (aperture, ISO, shutter speed), which could be stored in CSV or JSON files. These files might be used to store additional information about the images or to provide context for the deep learning models.

The context does not mention audio or video data formats directly, but it is possible that video data could be used in a deep learning pipeline for tasks such as tracking marine animals or analyzing their behavior. Video data would typically be stored in a container format such as MP4 or AVI, which can include multiple video and audio tracks.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline, it is likely that image data is the primary format, with additional information stored in CSV or JSON files. Video data might also be used in some cases.
