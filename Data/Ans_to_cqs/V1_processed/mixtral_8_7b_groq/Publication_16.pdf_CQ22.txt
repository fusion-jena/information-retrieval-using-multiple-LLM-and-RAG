The deep learning model's performance is evaluated using several metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Sensitivity, also known as recall, measures the proportion of true positive cases that are correctly identified. Specificity, on the other hand, measures the proportion of true negative cases that are correctly identified. Accuracy is the overall percentage of correct predictions made by the model. These metrics are used to assess the model's performance on the test data, and they are presented in Table 1 of the study.

The study reports the sensitivity and specificity for each species, with the Eurasian Collared Dove being the best-performing class with a sensitivity of 0.86 and a specificity of 0.90. The Lesser Spotted Woodpecker was the worst-performing class, with a sensitivity of 0.58 and a specificity of 0.91. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.83 for the train split and 0.74 for the test split.

The study also mentions that the classification results are presented using the evaluation metrics outlined previously. However, the specific names of these metrics are not provided in the given context. Nonetheless, it can be inferred that the evaluation metrics used in this study include accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.

In addition, the study discusses the use of data pre-processing techniques, such as segmenting the acquired audio files into 15-second windows and using MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) to extract features from each sample window. These pre-processing techniques are crucial in preparing the data for the deep learning model and can impact the model's performance.

Overall, the study evaluates the deep learning model's performance using several metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. These metrics are used to assess the model's ability to correctly identify true positive and true negative cases. The study also highlights the importance of data pre-processing techniques in preparing the data for the deep learning model.
