I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text mentions the methods and techniques used, such as a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for identifying wetland areas in historical maps, and some details about the training process, including the use of Adam optimization, dropout, cross-entropy loss, and a 10-fold cross-validation. However, it does not include the link to the code repository on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. For more information on the code repository, I would recommend contacting the authors of the study directly.
