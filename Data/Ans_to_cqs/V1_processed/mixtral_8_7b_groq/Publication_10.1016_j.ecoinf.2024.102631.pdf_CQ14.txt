Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context does not mention any methods such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization techniques. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to this query. However, it is common in machine learning and deep learning model development to use techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. These techniques involve trying different combinations of hyperparameters and selecting the set of hyperparameters that result in the best performance based on a validation dataset. Further information from the authors would be needed to provide a specific answer to this query.
