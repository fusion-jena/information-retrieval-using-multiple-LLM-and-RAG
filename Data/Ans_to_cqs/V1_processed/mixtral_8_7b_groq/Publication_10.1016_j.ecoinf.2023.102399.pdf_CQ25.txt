The purpose of the deep learning model in the study mentioned is for high-quality target detection, specifically for the estimation of fish biomass. The model is used to accurately detect and identify fish in underwater images, with a focus on using fish body area as a parameter to estimate body weight. The deep learning network is crucial in dealing with the complexities of the underwater environment, which can lead to greater errors in weight estimation if low-quality images are used.

The study aims to minimize the workload and complexity of image preprocessing by proposing a fully automatic biomass estimation method. While the specific type of deep learning model used is not mentioned in the provided abstract, it can be inferred that it is a model that is trained to detect and identify fish in underwater images, with a high level of accuracy.

Previous techniques have used deep learning for the automatic detection and identification of specific features of fish, such as the head and mouth of Southern Bluefin tuna (Ravanbakhsh et al., 2015). However, the study mentioned aims to go beyond this by achieving fully automated acquisition of biomass information, although it acknowledges that certain aspects of this are still lacking.

Overall, the deep learning model in this study is used for high-quality target detection in the context of fish biomass estimation, with a focus on increasing the efficiency and robustness of body weight estimation.
