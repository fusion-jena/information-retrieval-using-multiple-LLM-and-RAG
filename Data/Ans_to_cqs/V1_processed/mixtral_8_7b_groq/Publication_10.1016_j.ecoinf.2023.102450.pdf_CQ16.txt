The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context of video analysis, object detection, or curve prediction. However, in machine learning and deep learning, training is often considered complete when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly, or when the model starts to overfit the training data.

In the context of this document, it is possible that the training of the object detection model is considered complete when the prediction error, which is the difference between the predicted cycle time and the benchmark cycle time, stabilizes or reaches a minimum value. This is suggested by the presence of the "Mean prediction error" column in the data tables, which could be used as a metric to evaluate the performance of the model during training.

Another possible criterion for determining training completion could be the cross-correlation coefficient between the predicted and actual motion trajectories. The cross-correlation coefficient measures the similarity between two signals, and a high value indicates a strong correlation. In this document, the cross-correlation coefficient ranges from 0.015 to 0.98, which suggests that some videos have a high degree of similarity between the predicted and actual motion trajectories. Therefore, it is possible that the training is considered complete when the cross-correlation coefficient reaches a high value, indicating that the predicted and actual motion trajectories are highly similar.

Overall, while the provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine training completion, it is possible that the prediction error or the cross-correlation coefficient are used as metrics to evaluate the performance of the model during training.
