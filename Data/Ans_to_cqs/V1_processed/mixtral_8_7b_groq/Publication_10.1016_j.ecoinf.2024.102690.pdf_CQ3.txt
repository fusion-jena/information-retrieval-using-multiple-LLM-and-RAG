The provided context does not include information about data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does provide information about a study that used various data sources and methods for analyzing ecological leisure corridors and optional ecological sources.

The study used data from the National Earth System Science Data Center, CRU dataset, Guangzhou statistical yearbook and national grain trading center, and Geographic Data Sharing Infrastructure, College of Urban and Environmental Science, Peking University. The data used included grain price data, spatial resolution data, and landscape type data.

In terms of methods, the study used an unsupervised learning neural network approach called SOFM (Self-Organizing Feature Map) to allocate research units into different ES (Ecosystem Service) bundles based on spatial similarities. The ES bundles were established by calculating the Davis-Boldin Index (DBI) and used as the basis for identifying ecological sources and setting scenarios. Hotspot analysis was also used to analyze the spatial clustering of ESV (Ecosystem Service Value) and consider hotspot areas with a significance level of 90% or more as optional ecological sources.

The study focused on ecological leisure corridors, which were identified along species migration corridors and river runoff corridors. The corridors were mainly composed of rivers, reservoirs, and ponds and provided vital habitat support for animal migration.

Overall, while the provided context does not directly answer the query about data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, it does provide insight into the data sources and methods used in a study focused on ecological leisure corridors and optional ecological sources.
