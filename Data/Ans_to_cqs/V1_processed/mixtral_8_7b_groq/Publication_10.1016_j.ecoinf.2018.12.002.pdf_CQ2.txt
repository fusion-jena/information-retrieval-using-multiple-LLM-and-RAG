The provided context does not contain specific information about the use of deep learning algorithms. However, it does mention the use of various machine learning algorithms for inferring animal behavior from movement data. The data formats used in these studies are primarily location and movement data, which are typically represented in a structured format such as CSV or a custom file format.

For example, in the study by Guiming Wang (2019), the authors used location data in the form of latitude and longitude coordinates to classify the behaviors of animals. Similarly, in the study by Brewster et al. (2018), the authors used acceleration data (ACC) to classify the behaviors of lemon sharks. These data are likely represented in a structured format such as CSV, which can be easily processed by machine learning algorithms.

In general, the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline depend on the specific problem being addressed and the type of data available. For image-based tasks, such as object recognition or image segmentation, the data format is typically a multi-dimensional array representing the pixel values of the image. For audio-based tasks, such as speech recognition or music analysis, the data format is typically a one-dimensional array representing the audio waveform. For video-based tasks, such as action recognition or object tracking, the data format is typically a multi-dimensional array representing the pixel values of each frame in the video.

In summary, while the provided context does not specifically mention the use of deep learning algorithms, it does indicate that machine learning algorithms have been applied to location and movement data in a structured format such as CSV. In general, the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline depend on the specific problem being addressed and the type of data available.
