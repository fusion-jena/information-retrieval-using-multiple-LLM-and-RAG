The strategy to monitor model performance during training in the context of Sashimi, a toolkit for automating and evaluating image segmentation, is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the model is evaluated based on the quality of the segmentation masks generated during the training process.

The training procedure involves manually annotating pixel coordinates to create precise organismal segmentation models. The annotations are made directly around the fish body boundary, where the foreground pixels of the target fish body meet those of the background. The quality of the supplied mask annotations for training dataset images is an important consideration. Care is taken during manual annotation to ensure that the coordinates reflect a smooth boundary delineating the background pixels from the foreground pixels, rather than a more jagged, rough approximation of the target's location within the image.

The text suggests that users interested in refining the model for different use cases should anticipate iteratively training models with different sized training datasets and parameters until suitable performance is achieved. This implies that the model performance is being monitored during the training process, and adjustments are made accordingly.

Furthermore, the text mentions that the Sashimi online model repository (<https://sashi.mi.shawntylerschwartz.lygonal.com>) provides pre-trained models for different organisms. The availability of these pre-trained models suggests that the model performance is being evaluated not just during the training process, but also after the training is complete.

In summary, while the text does not provide explicit details about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, it can be inferred that the quality of the segmentation masks and the performance of the model are being evaluated during the training process and after the training is complete.
