The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is common practice to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which is beneficial for the computationally intensive tasks involved in deep learning. Therefore, it is likely that GPUs were used for training this model. Other hardware resources such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) could also have been used, but this is not mentioned in the context.
