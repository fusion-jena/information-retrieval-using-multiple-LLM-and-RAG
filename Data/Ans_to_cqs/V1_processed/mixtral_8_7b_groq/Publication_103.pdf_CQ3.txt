The provided context does not include specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a generic annotation system called Annosys, which is implemented for schema-based data using the example of biodiversity collection data. The Annosys system is used in the context of herbarium specimens classification and transfer learning across herbarium data from different regions.

Annosys could potentially support various data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. However, the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.

In summary, while the context provides information about the use of a generic annotation system called Annosys in the deep learning pipeline for biodiversity collection data, it does not include specific details about the data annotation techniques used.
