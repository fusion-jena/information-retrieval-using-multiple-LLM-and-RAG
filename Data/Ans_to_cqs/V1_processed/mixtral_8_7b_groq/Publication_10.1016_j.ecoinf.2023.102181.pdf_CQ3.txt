The provided context does not directly discuss data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of machine learning models for predicting soil classes and marine benthic habitats. These models would likely require annotated data for training.

In the context of computer vision, which is a common application of deep learning, data annotation techniques include:

1. **Bounding box annotation**: This technique involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image. It is useful for object detection tasks where the goal is to identify the location of an object in an image.

2. **Semantic segmentation**: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with the class of the object it belongs to. It is useful for image segmentation tasks where the goal is to partition an image into multiple regions corresponding to different objects.

3. **Instance segmentation**: This technique is an extension of semantic segmentation and involves not only labeling each pixel with the class of the object it belongs to, but also distinguishing between individual instances of the same class. It is useful for tasks where the goal is to identify and count individual objects in an image.

4. **Classification**: This technique involves labeling an entire image with the class of the dominant object in the image. It is useful for image classification tasks where the goal is to categorize images into different classes.

5. **Regression**: This technique involves predicting a continuous value associated with an image or a part of an image. It is useful for tasks where the goal is to measure a property of an object in an image, such as its size or shape.

The selection of the appropriate data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the desired output. It is important to note that data annotation is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process that requires careful consideration and planning.
