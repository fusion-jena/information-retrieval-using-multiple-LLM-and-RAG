When preprocessing data for a deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be used to address data bias. These techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a method of splitting data into training, validation, and testing sets while preserving the distribution of classes in the original dataset. This technique is useful when the dataset is imbalanced, meaning that one class has significantly more samples than the other class(es). By using stratified splitting, we can ensure that each subset of the data contains a representative sample of all classes.

Oversampling is a technique used to increase the number of samples in a minority class. This can be done by randomly duplicating samples from the minority class or by generating new samples using techniques such as Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). Oversampling can help to prevent the deep learning model from being biased towards the majority class.

Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the number of samples in the majority class. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of samples from the majority class. Undersampling can help to prevent overfitting of the deep learning model to the majority class.

Diverse data collection is a technique used to ensure that the data used in the deep learning pipeline is representative of the population being studied. This can be done by collecting data from multiple sources, such as different geographical locations, sensors, or time periods. Diverse data collection can help to prevent bias in the deep learning model by ensuring that it is exposed to a wide range of variability in the data.

In the context of remote sensing and ecological informatics, these techniques can be used to address data bias in applications such as predicting water status of winter wheat, detecting Verticillium wilt of olive using UAV multispectral features, monitoring forest disease spread, and managing insect pests and diseases. For example, in the study by Zhang et al. (2024), the authors used a combination of oversampling and stratified splitting to address data bias in their dataset.
