The provided context does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the Bat Detective project. However, it does mention that user annotations were used to label sound clips as containing bat calls, specifically search-phase echolocation calls. It is likely that some form of audio annotation was used, such as labeling specific time segments or spectrogram regions with class labels.

The context also mentions several papers about deep learning and neural networks, but these papers focus on environmental sound classification, speech recognition, and large-scale audio classification rather than data annotation techniques.

To summarize, the provided context does not give specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the Bat Detective project. It is likely that some form of audio annotation was used, but the specific method is not mentioned.
