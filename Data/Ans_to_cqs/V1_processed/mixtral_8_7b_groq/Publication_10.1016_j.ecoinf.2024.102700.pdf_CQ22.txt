The provided context discusses various metrics used to evaluate the performance of models in general, although it does not explicitly mention deep learning models. However, we can still infer the applicable metrics based on the given information.

In the context, several metrics are mentioned, such as Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity (which is also known as Recall), and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC curve). These are common evaluation metrics for predictive models, including deep learning models.

Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions. Precision, on the other hand, focuses on the positive predictions and is the ratio of correct positive predictions to the total predicted positives. Recall (Sensitivity) measures the proportion of correctly identified positive cases among all actual positives. The AUC-ROC curve is a popular metric for binary classification problems, representing the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.

The context also highlights the need for incorporating multiple validation metrics when assessing model performance, as it ensures the integration of different aspects of the model's predictive capabilities, including both calibration (the extent to which a model correctly predicts the conditional probability of presence) and discrimination (the ability to distinguish between occupied and unoccupied sites).

In summary, for deep learning models, the following metrics can be used to evaluate performance:

1. Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions.
2. Precision: The ratio of correct positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
3. Recall (Sensitivity): The proportion of correctly identified positive cases among all actual positives.
4. AUC-ROC curve: Represents the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.

These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance from different perspectives.
