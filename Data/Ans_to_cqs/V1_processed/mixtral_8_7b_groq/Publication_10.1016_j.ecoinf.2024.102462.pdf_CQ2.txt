The provided context discusses the use of deep learning (DL) for image classification, specifically for classifying shrub species based on image data. Therefore, the primary data format used in this DL pipeline is images.

The study compares the performance of the ResNet network to three newer architectures, including ViT, Swin, and ConvNeXt. These networks are fine-tuned and evaluated using image datasets. However, the context does not provide specific details about the format of these image datasets.

The experiments also highlight the importance of building publicly available image databases to improve the results of image classification tasks. This suggests that the study uses image data stored in a database or similar format.

In summary, the primary data format used in the DL pipeline discussed in the provided context is images. However, the context does not provide specific details about the format of the image datasets used in the study.
