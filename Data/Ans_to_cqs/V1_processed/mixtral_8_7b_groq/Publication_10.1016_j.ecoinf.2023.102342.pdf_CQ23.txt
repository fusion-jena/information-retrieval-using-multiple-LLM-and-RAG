The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does discuss the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, which includes data pre-selection and optimization steps that could contribute to the model's generalizability.

In the KDD process, the pre-selection of useful data is an essential step. This step involves identifying and selecting relevant data for the specific study area, which could help ensure the diversity and representativeness of the dataset. A diverse dataset can contribute to the deep learning model's generalizability, as it allows the model to learn from various patterns and relationships within the data.

Additionally, the optimization and elaboration step involves the use of statistical methods. Although not specified, these statistical methods could include cross-validation, a technique used to assess the performance and generalizability of a model. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on one subset, and testing it on another. This process is repeated, using different subsets for training and testing, to assess the model's performance on unseen data.

However, the context does not mention any stratified splitting techniques. Stratified splitting is a method used to ensure that the subsets used in cross-validation maintain the same proportions of classes or categories as the original dataset. This method can be helpful in cases where the dataset is imbalanced, as it ensures that the model is trained and tested on a diverse range of data points.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, it does discuss data pre-selection and optimization steps that could contribute to the model's generalizability. These steps include the selection of a diverse dataset and the use of statistical methods, possibly including cross-validation. However, the context does not mention any stratified splitting techniques.
