The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training typically include creating a training set, a validation set, and a test set. However, the specifics of how this split is done in the context provided are not explicitly stated.

In the study mentioned, the authors used pre-training with additional acoustic reference data, followed by fine-tuning with ROI (Region of Interest) data from their study site. This suggests a two-step process for training the model, where the first step involves pre-training on a larger dataset, and the second step involves fine-tuning on a smaller, more specific dataset.

Additionally, the authors mention performing data augmentation on the training datasets. This involves splitting the merged .wav training file for each species in half and then adding these two halves sample-wise. This augmented .wav file was then used for training, which would have effectively increased the size of the training set.

However, there is no explicit mention of a validation set or a test set. A validation set is typically used during the training process to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance. This helps to tune the model's parameters and prevent overfitting. A test set, on the other hand, is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

Therefore, while the specific criteria used to split the data for training, validation, and testing are not provided, it can be inferred that the authors used a two-step training process involving pre-training and fine-tuning, and also performed data augmentation to increase the size of the training set.
