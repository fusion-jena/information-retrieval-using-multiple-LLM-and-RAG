The provided context does not include a direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the data and code used in the study have been published. Cusick et al. (2024) used YOLOv6 for object detection and tested various hyper-parameters and spatial resolutions, ultimately deciding to use the default settings. They also refer to work by Van Rijsbergen (1979), Weimerskirch et al. (2018), Witharana and Lynch (2016), and Wood et al. (2021) in their methods.

To access the data and code, it would be necessary to look up the published paper by Cusick et al. (2024) in Ecological Informatics or contact the authors directly for more information on the data repository. Reputable data repositories include Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF, among others. It is good practice for researchers to share their data and code to promote transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in the scientific community.

In summary, while the exact data repository link is not provided in the context, the data and code used in the study have been made available through publication. To access the repository, it is recommended to look up the published paper by Cusick et al. (2024) or contact the authors for more information.
