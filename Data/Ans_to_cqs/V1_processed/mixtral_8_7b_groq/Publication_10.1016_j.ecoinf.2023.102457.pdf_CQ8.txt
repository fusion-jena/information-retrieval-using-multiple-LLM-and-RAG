The code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this study does not seem to be provided in the given context. The methods and code for running the BirdNET model were based on the code and methods presented in <https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer>, but it is not clear if the exact code used in this study is available in that repository. Additionally, the code was run in Python version 3.10, but the specific repository for the code used in this study is not mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository for the deep learning pipeline code used in this study.
