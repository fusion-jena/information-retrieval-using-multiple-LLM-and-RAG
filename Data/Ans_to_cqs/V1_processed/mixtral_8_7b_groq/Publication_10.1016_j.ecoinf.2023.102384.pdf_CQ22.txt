The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the given context are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE). These counting metrics are used to assess the counting performance of the model.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and ground truth counts of insects in an image. It measures the average magnitude of the errors in the predictions made by the model.

Mean Squared Error (MSE) is calculated as the average of the squared differences between the predicted and ground truth counts of insects in an image. It measures the average squared error of the predictions made by the model.

Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE) is calculated as the average of the absolute relative differences between the predicted and ground truth counts of insects in an image. It measures the average relative error of the predictions made by the model.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in counting the number of insects in an image. The model's performance is assessed based on how close its predictions are to the ground truth counts of insects in the image.

It is worth noting that the evaluation of the model's performance is done using a non-publicly available dataset, and the model is assessed against the PST dataset. The training subset of the PST dataset is used for the supervised learning step concerning PCθ, while the overall counting pipeline is evaluated on the test split.

The counting ability of the proposed approaches is investigated using the counting golden standard evaluators, which consider only the pest counting module PCθ. Further experiments are performed taking into account some hybrid metrics that simultaneously consider the count error and the estimated raw locations of the insects, considering the entire pipeline, i.e., the PCθ, DG, and SG modules.

Therefore, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the given context are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE), which are used to assess the counting performance of the model.
