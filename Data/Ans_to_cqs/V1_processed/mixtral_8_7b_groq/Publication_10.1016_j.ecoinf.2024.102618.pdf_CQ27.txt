The provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does provide information about the dataset used, the deep learning models chosen, and the performance metrics used to evaluate the models.

The dataset used in this study contains images from various years, ranging from 1642 to 2022. These images were pre-processed before being used with the suggested models. The study compares five different deep learning models, including DenseNet201, efficientNetB0, efficientNetB3, Inceptionresnetv2, and ResNet50v2. The models were evaluated based on their accuracy and F1-score.

To deploy a trained deep learning model, there are several steps that are typically followed. First, the model is trained and evaluated using a development dataset. Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it is typically saved to disk using a process called model serialization. Model serialization involves saving the model's architecture, weights, and other relevant information to a file. This file can then be loaded and used to make predictions on new data.

After the model has been serialized, the next step is to select a platform for deployment. The platform selected will depend on several factors, including the intended use case, the volume of data to be processed, and the available resources. Common deployment platforms for deep learning models include local servers, cloud-based platforms, and edge devices.

Once the platform has been selected, the serialized model can be loaded and used to make predictions on new data. The specific steps required to load and use the model will depend on the platform and the programming language used.

Based on the provided context, it is likely that the trained deep learning models were serialized and saved to disk. However, the context does not provide information about the platform used for deployment or the specific steps taken to deploy the models. Therefore, a complete answer to this query cannot be provided based on the available information.
