The provided context discusses various aspects of machine learning and deep learning pipelines, but it does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness using a random seed value. However, it is important to note that setting a random seed value is a common practice in machine learning and deep learning to ensure reproducibility of results.

In the context, it is mentioned that the authors used the Adam learning rate optimizer, which automatically adjusts the initial learning rate during training. Adam uses a specific scheme to adjust the learning rate, which involves some randomness due to the use of mini-batches and random initialization of weights. However, the authors do not mention if they fixed the random seed for the Adam optimizer. If they did, it would ensure that the same sequence of weight updates is generated across different runs, improving reproducibility.

Furthermore, the context discusses the use of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier as part of a machine learning workflow. SVMs, like deep learning models, involve randomness due to the use of random subsamples for training. Fixing the random seed value ensures consistent subsampling, which in turn contributes to reproducible results.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is a common practice in machine learning and deep learning to ensure reproducibility. The authors' use of the Adam optimizer and SVM classifier implies that they might have used a fixed random seed value, but this is not explicitly stated in the context.
