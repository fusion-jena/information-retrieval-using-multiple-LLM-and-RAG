The provided context does not give information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It mentions the datasets used for training the models, which are COCO 2017train dataset for Mask R-CNN and Kinetics-400 dataset for the ResNet variants. However, it does not specify where these datasets can be accessed or if there is a combined repository for the whole pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional context.
