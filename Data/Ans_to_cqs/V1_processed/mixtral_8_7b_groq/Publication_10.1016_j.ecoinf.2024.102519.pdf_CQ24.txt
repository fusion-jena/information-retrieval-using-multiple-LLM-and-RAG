While the provided context does not directly mention strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, it does discuss the use of randomness in Genetic Algorithms (GA), another artificial intelligence method. In GA, randomness is employed in several ways, such as the initialization of the population and the application of genetic operators like selection, crossover, and mutation. These strategies could provide insights into how randomness might be managed in deep learning pipelines.

In deep learning, randomness can be used to improve model performance, prevent overfitting, and explore different aspects of the data space. Here are some strategies employed to handle randomness in deep learning:

1. **Random Initialization**: Deep learning models typically involve initializing weights randomly at the beginning of training. This helps the model avoid symmetry and explore different areas of the weight space, enabling it to learn various features from the data.

2. **Random Data Shuffling**: Before each epoch, the training dataset is randomly shuffled to ensure that the model does not learn patterns from the data in a specific order. This helps improve model generalization and avoid overfitting.

3. **Dropout**: During training, dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero, preventing over-reliance on specific neurons and encouraging the model to learn more robust features.

4. **Batch Normalization**: This technique normalizes the inputs of each batch, reducing internal covariate shift and making the network more stable during training. The mean and variance are calculated from the mini-batch, and randomness is introduced by sampling from the distribution of inputs.

5. **Random Seed**: To ensure reproducibility, deep learning frameworks allow users to set a random seed value. This initializes the random number generator, ensuring consistent random number sequences across different runs.

While the context focuses on GA, these strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines can help improve model performance, prevent overfitting, and encourage exploration of the data space.
