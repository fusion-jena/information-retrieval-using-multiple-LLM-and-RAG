The deep learning model in question is used for object detection, specifically for identifying and locating the most frequent and common species of plants within images. This is achieved through the use of a region-of-interest (ROI) pooling technique, which aids in the selection and analysis of specific image regions for accurate object classification.

The model is built on two versions of Faster R-CNN, a popular object detection algorithm in computer vision. Both versions use Resnet50 as a backbone and are pre-trained on ImageNet. However, they differ in the input dimensions, with one version having an input dimension of 640 × 640 and the other 1280 × 1280. The 1280 version was used in the benchmark as it yielded more consistent results, likely due to the important features being too small when using the lower resolution.

In addition to its object detection capabilities, the deep learning model also leverages data augmentation techniques to improve its performance and reliability. These techniques include random cropping, mosaic, color distortions (such as brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, Gaussian blur), random scaling, random rotation, and random horizontal flipping. These techniques help to create new samples from the existing dataset, improving the model's ability to generalize and making it more reliable on a wider range of input data, such as images from old microscope slides.

Therefore, the deep learning model serves a dual purpose: it is used for plant species identification within images, and it employs data augmentation techniques to improve its reliability and performance on a variety of input data.
