Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating that a deep learning model was used in the study. The models mentioned are Bayesian logistic regression, MLE logistic regression, Bayesian GAM, and random forest, which are all types of machine learning models but not deep learning models. Deep learning models are a subset of machine learning models that have multiple hidden layers and are designed to learn from large datasets.

Therefore, I cannot answer the query about the purpose of the deep learning model in this study because no such model was used.
