The metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the given context is accuracy. The authors have mentioned the accuracy of the models in several instances when comparing the performance of transfer learning models with models trained from scratch. For example, they have stated that "the accuracy of the transfer learning model was always better than that of the model trained from scratch" and "TLS_4 achieved accuracies of 92.4%, 92.6%, 93.75%, 94.0%, and 94.3%, respectively." However, the context does not mention any other metrics such as precision or recall.

Moreover, the authors have used a binomial test to compare the accuracy of the transfer learning models with the model trained from scratch. The binomial test probability values between the best-performing transfer strategy and other transfer strategies have been provided in Figure 5(b), which further indicates that accuracy is the primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the models.

Therefore, based on the given context, the metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is accuracy.
