The deep learning pipeline can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV data. The provided context focuses on bird sound recognition, which involves audio data.

In the context, bird sounds are transformed into spectrograms, a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies in a sound or signal as they vary with time (Incze et al., 2018). Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are then applied to classify bird sounds based on these spectrograms. This demonstrates the use of image-like data (spectrograms) in the deep learning pipeline for bird sound recognition.

For audio data, Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are another common feature extraction method. MFCCs capture the important features of sound, such as pitch and timbre, and are used as input for deep learning models (Kumar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023b). In the LDFSRE-NET and MFF-ScSEnet models, bird voice recognition is achieved by combining bird voice features extracted using MFCCs and deep learning models (Hu et al., 2023b; Hu et al., 2023a).

In addition to audio and image data, deep learning models can also process video data. Video data can be represented as a sequence of images or frames, which can be processed using CNNs or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for various applications, such as action recognition or object detection in videos.

CSV data, which are structured tables with rows and columns, can also be used in the deep learning pipeline. CSV data can be processed using fully connected neural networks or RNNs for tasks such as regression, classification, or time series forecasting.

Overall, the deep learning pipeline can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV data. The choice of data format and feature extraction method depends on the specific application and the nature of the data.
