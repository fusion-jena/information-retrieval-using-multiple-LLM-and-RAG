The text provided discusses the use of validation data to prevent overfitting in the deep learning model training process, but it does not explicitly mention specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

In the context of deep learning model training, regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data that may not generalize well to new, unseen data.

Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are "dropped out" or ignored during training, which helps to prevent over-reliance on any single neuron and encourages the model to learn more robust features.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a technique where a penalty term proportional to the square of the model weights is added to the loss function. This encourages the model to learn smaller weight values, which can help to reduce overfitting by preventing the model from assigning too much importance to any single feature.

The text mentions the use of a validation set to monitor the training process and prevent overfitting, which is a form of regularization in itself. By setting aside a portion of the training data as a validation set, the model's performance can be evaluated on data that it has not seen during training. If the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade, it may indicate that the model is beginning to overfit to the training data, and training can be stopped early to prevent this.

While the text does not explicitly mention dropout or L2 regularization, it is possible that these techniques were used in addition to the validation set approach to further prevent overfitting. However, without further information, it is not possible to say for certain.
