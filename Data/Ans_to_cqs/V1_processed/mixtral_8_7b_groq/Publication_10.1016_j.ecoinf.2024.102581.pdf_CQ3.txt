The provided context does not give specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the studies mentioned. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the plant image dataset.

Data augmentation techniques include random rotation, random cropping, random flipping, random color jittering, and random noise addition. These techniques help create various transformations of the original images, effectively increasing the size and diversity of the training dataset.

Although not directly related to annotation techniques, data augmentation is a common practice in deep learning pipelines to improve model performance and prevent overfitting. It is important to note that the annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline may vary depending on the specific problem and dataset.

For instance, in object detection tasks, bounding box annotation is commonly used, where a bounding box is drawn around the object of interest in an image. In semantic segmentation tasks, pixel-wise annotation is used, where each pixel in an image is labeled according to the object class it belongs to. Instance segmentation, on the other hand, combines object detection and semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and assigned a class label.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques, it does discuss data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Data annotation techniques can vary depending on the problem and dataset, with common techniques including bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation.
