Based on the provided context, TensorFlow is the framework used to build the deep learning model. The Abadi et al. (2015) reference provides the official website of TensorFlow, indicating its use in the development of the model. Additionally, the Allen et al. (2021) reference mentions the use of TensorFlow Hub, a library built on top of TensorFlow, for generating embeddings. Therefore, it can be concluded that TensorFlow is the framework used to build the deep learning model.
