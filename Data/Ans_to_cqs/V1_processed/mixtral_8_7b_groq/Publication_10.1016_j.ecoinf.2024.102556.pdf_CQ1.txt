The provided context does not directly answer the query regarding the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the usage of images and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in specific studies.

In Hu et al. (2020), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were used to estimate the population size of migrating Tibetan antelopes (Pantholops hodgsonii). Here, UAVs served as a tool for capturing images, which were then likely processed to extract features and count the number of antelopes.

In the study by He et al. (2019), researchers used red panda faces to distinguish individual red pandas. This implies the usage of images or videos as raw data sources. However, the context does not explicitly mention the data collection method.

In general, deep learning pipelines can utilize various methods for collecting raw data, including:

1. Surveys: Collecting data through questionnaires or interviews, although this method is more common in social sciences and not directly mentioned in the context.
2. Sensors: Utilizing sensors to collect data, such as temperature sensors, pressure sensors, or accelerometers. Again, this method is not directly mentioned in the context.
3. Public datasets: Using publicly available datasets, such as ImageNet for image classification or COCO for object detection. These datasets are often used as benchmarks for evaluating deep learning models.
4. Custom datasets: Creating custom datasets by collecting data specifically for a particular project or study. This can include collecting images, videos, audio recordings, or other types of data, depending on the project's requirements.

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that custom datasets, particularly images and videos, are commonly used in deep learning pipelines related to computer vision tasks. However, the context does not explicitly mention other data collection methods such as surveys or sensors.
