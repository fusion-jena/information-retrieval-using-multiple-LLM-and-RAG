Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the training of machine learning models in this study is likely completed when the validation loss plateaus or shows minimal improvement. This is a common practice in machine learning model training, where the goal is to find the optimal set of model parameters that minimize the validation loss.

For instance, in the context, several machine learning models such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) are used for estimating rice LCC (Leaf Chlorophyll Content) and crop coverage. These models are trained and validated using a dataset, and the training process may involve iterative adjustments of model parameters to minimize the validation loss.

In addition, the context mentions the use of a validation set for accuracy evaluation of rice canopy coverage in Qian Gorlos irrigation district. This suggests that the models are likely trained using a separate training set, and the validation set is used to assess the model performance and prevent overfitting.

Therefore, while the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly stated in the context, it can be inferred that the training process involves minimizing the validation loss until it plateaus or shows minimal improvement.
