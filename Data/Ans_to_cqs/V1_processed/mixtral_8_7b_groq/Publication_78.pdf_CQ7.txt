The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, there are some insights that can be used to make an educated guess.

In machine learning, it is common practice to split the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

In the context of deep learning, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), data splitting can be done in various ways. One common approach is to use k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is divided into k subsets or folds. The model is then trained k times, each time using a different fold as the validation set and the remaining k-1 folds as the training set. The average performance across all k runs is used as the final model's performance.

In the provided context, there is a reference to Algorithm 1, which is the k-means clustering algorithm. Although this algorithm is not directly related to deep learning, it can be used for unsupervised pre-training of deep learning models. In this case, the dataset can be split into two subsets: one for training the k-means model and generating the initial weights for the deep learning model, and another for fine-tuning the deep learning model.

Furthermore, in the context of the SVM classifier, there is a reference to the confusion matrix, which is a performance evaluation metric. The confusion matrix can be calculated using a test set, which is a separate subset of data not used during the training or validation phases.

In summary, although the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it can be inferred that k-fold cross-validation, unsupervised pre-training, or a simple train-test split can be used for splitting the data.
