The provided context does not give information about a deep learning pipeline or any of the standard datasets commonly used in deep learning research, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context describes a study that used a discriminant analysis to classify animal tracks by species and sex.

The study used a dataset of 367 fisher tracks and 167 marten tracks, with each track represented by 124 morphometric variables. These variables were extracted from the tracks using the Fisher Individual Tracking (FIT) software and included distances, angles, and areas calculated from seven landmark points.

The dataset was divided into training, validation, and test sets for the discriminant analysis. The training set consisted of 82 marten tracks and 184 fisher tracks, the validation set consisted of 43 marten tracks and 92 fisher tracks, and the test set consisted of 42 marten tracks and 91 fisher tracks. The total number of tracks in the dataset was 534, with 177 male tracks and 190 female tracks.

The study also used a reference dataset of known species and sex for fisher and marten, created from camera trap images. This dataset was used to evaluate observer bias in the manual marking of landmark points in the FIT interface.

Therefore, while the study does describe a dataset and a classification analysis, it does not describe a deep learning pipeline or any of the standard deep learning datasets.
