The specific deep learning frameworks used to build models for predicting water quality parameters from hyperspectral data are not mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that deep learning algorithms have been applied to hyperspectral data for this purpose.

Deep learning frameworks are software libraries that allow developers to build and train deep learning models. Some popular deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Caffe. These frameworks provide tools for building and training neural networks, as well as for performing various data preprocessing and visualization tasks.

In the context of predicting water quality parameters from hyperspectral data, a deep learning model might be built using a framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch. These frameworks provide the necessary tools for building and training complex neural network architectures, which can be used to learn the relationship between hyperspectral data and water quality parameters.

For example, Maier et al. (2021) used the TensorFlow framework to build a deep learning model for estimating chlorophyll a concentration in inland water bodies using hyperspectral data. They used a deep learning architecture called a wasi-NN, which is a type of neural network that is well-suited for processing time series data.

In summary, while the specific deep learning frameworks used to build models for predicting water quality parameters from hyperspectral data are not mentioned in the provided context, it is likely that frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch were used. These frameworks provide the necessary tools for building and training complex neural network architectures, which can be used to learn the relationship between hyperspectral data and water quality parameters.
