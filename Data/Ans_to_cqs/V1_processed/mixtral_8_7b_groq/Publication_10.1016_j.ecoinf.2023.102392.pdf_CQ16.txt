The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the XGBoost model. However, in machine learning models like XGBoost, training is often stopped when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving or plateaus, indicating that the model is not learning any more from the training data. This is typically determined by monitoring the loss function or other performance metrics on the validation set after each epoch or iteration of training. Once the performance stops improving, the training process is stopped to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability.

In the context of the tables provided, Table 7 shows the accuracy metrics for the XGBoost model's land use/land cover classification, while Table 8 shows the accuracy metrics for the forest types classification. These tables report the overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa statistics, which can be used to evaluate the model's performance. However, they do not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, while the provided context suggests that the XGBoost model was used to classify land use/land cover and forest types with high accuracy, it does not provide specific information on the training criteria used to achieve these results.
