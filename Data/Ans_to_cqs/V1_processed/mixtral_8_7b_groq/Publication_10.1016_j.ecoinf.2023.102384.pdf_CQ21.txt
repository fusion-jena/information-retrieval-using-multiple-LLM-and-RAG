The postprocessing steps involved after the model training, as described in the provided context, include the generation of saliency maps and the calculation of metrics. However, a confusion matrix is not explicitly mentioned.

In the context, it is stated that during the validation phase, the images are divided into regularly-spaced, overlapping patches using the same size employed during training. These patches are then processed individually, and the overall output is reconstructed by combining the predictions from the patches. For the solution based on detection, non-maximum suppression is used to obtain the final global output.

After the reconstruction of the overall output, metrics are calculated over the complete image. However, the specific metrics to be calculated are not mentioned in the context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are:

1. Dividing the images into regularly-spaced, overlapping patches.
2. Processing these patches individually.
3. Reconstructing the overall output by combining the predictions from the patches.
4. Applying non-maximum suppression (for the solution based on detection).
5. Calculating metrics over the complete image.

A confusion matrix is not explicitly mentioned as a postprocessing step.
