Based on the provided context, the query asks about regularization methods to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. However, the context focuses on hyperparameter optimization for a random forest (RF) algorithm in a wildfire detection study, and it does not mention any deep learning models or regularization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given context.

In general, deep learning pipelines often use regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. Some common regularization methods include:

1. L1 and L2 regularization: These are penalty terms added to the loss function to reduce the complexity of the model. L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds an absolute value of the magnitude of the coefficients as a penalty term. L2 regularization, or Ridge regularization, adds the squared magnitude of the coefficients as a penalty term.

2. Dropout: This is a technique used in neural networks where randomly selected neurons are "dropped out" during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the network more robust and less dependent on specific neurons.

3. Early stopping: This is a method that stops training when the performance on a validation set stops improving, preventing the model from further overfitting to the training data.

4. Data augmentation: This technique generates new training samples by applying transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping) to the existing data, which can help improve the model's generalization and prevent overfitting.
