The specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model is not provided in the context. However, it can be inferred that the training process was conducted on a computer, and the batch size was set to 32 to make full use of the computer resources and not exceed the memory limit. This suggests that a GPU or other specialized hardware for deep learning might have been used, but it is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the answer is:


The context does not provide explicit information on the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that a computer with sufficient memory was used, and the batch size was set to 32, which suggests that a GPU or other specialized hardware for deep learning might have been used.
