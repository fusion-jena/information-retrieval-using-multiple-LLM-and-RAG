Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the criteria used to split the data for DeepLabV3+ model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it is common practice in deep learning to split the data into these three sets to evaluate the performance of the model and prevent overfitting.

In general, the data is typically split into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the selected model.

The exact criteria for splitting the data can vary depending on the specific use case and the amount of available data. One common approach is to split the data into 60% training, 20% validation, and 20% testing sets. Another approach is to use k-fold cross-validation, where the data is split into k subsets, and the model is trained and validated k times, each time using a different subset as the validation set and the remaining k-1 subsets as the training set.

In the context of remote sensing image analysis, such as the study referenced in the provided text, the data split criteria may also depend on the specific characteristics of the remote sensing data, such as the number of available images, the spatial and temporal resolution, and the geographical distribution of the images.

Regarding the DeepLabV3+ model, the provided context suggests that a large amount of training data is required to build a satisfactory model, especially when including a Near-Infrared (NIR) band in addition to the RGB bands. This implies that a sufficient amount of data should be allocated to the training set to ensure that the model can learn the necessary features from the input images.

Furthermore, the DeepLabV3+ architecture may need to be adjusted to accommodate four-channel input images, which may require additional data for training the new weights associated with the NIR band. In this case, the data split criteria should be carefully designed to ensure that there is enough data for training and validating the modified architecture.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for DeepLabV3+ model training, it is common practice in deep learning to split the data into training, validation, and testing sets. The exact criteria may vary depending on the specific use case and the characteristics of the remote sensing data. In the case of DeepLabV3+, a sufficient amount of training data is required to build a satisfactory model, especially when including additional bands such as the NIR band.
