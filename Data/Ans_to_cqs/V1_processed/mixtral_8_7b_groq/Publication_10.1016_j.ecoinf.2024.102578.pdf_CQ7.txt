Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. The text focuses on the description of the models trained for Finnmark and Yamal, as well as the performance metrics of these models.

In general, when building and training deep learning models, it is essential to split the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. This practice helps to assess the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

1. Training set: This subset is used to train the model by adjusting its parameters based on the error it makes during the learning process.
2. Validation set: This subset is used to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. It is used during the training phase to validate the model's performance on unseen data.
3. Testing set: This subset is used to evaluate the final model's performance. It is the ultimate judge of how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

In practice, the data can be split using various techniques, such as random sampling, time-series splitting, or even using separate datasets for each subset. However, the provided context does not contain information about the specific criteria used for splitting the data in this case.
