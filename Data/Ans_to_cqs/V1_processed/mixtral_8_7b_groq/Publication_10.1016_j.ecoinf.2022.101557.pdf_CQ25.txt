Based on the provided context, the deep learning model in use is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for image classification tasks. 

The data is first pre-processed by splitting it into larger blocks based on coordinates for cross-validation. These blocks are then divided into smaller areas of 80 × 80 pixels to prevent overfitting. The model is trained for 150 epochs with a batch size of 128, using dropout and ADAM optimisation to minimize the cross-entropy loss between the network’s predictions and the pre-labelled data.

The purpose of this CNN model is to classify different areas of a map based on the provided annotated dataset. The model undergoes a 10-fold cross-validation process, where it is trained on 9 out of 10 sets and evaluated on the remaining set. This process is repeated for all 10 sets, providing a more reliable and generalizable result for the map classification task.

The CNN model is challenged by the varying terrain and map styles in different areas, making it an effective tool for classifying diverse and complex map data. However, the context does not mention any specific details about the classes or categories the CNN model is classifying. Nonetheless, the primary objective of the deep learning model in this context is to perform image classification tasks on map data.
