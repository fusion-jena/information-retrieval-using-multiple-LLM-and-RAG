I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in BirdNET. The pieces of context mention various studies and papers related to BirdNET, a research project between The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Chemnitz University of Technology, and its ability to identify over 3,000 bird species using a deep neural network. However, there is no information on where the code repository for this deep learning pipeline can be found, e.g., on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. I hope this information helps, and I apologize for not being able to provide the exact link to the code repository.
