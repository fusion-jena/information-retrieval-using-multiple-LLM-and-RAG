The study used 10-fold cross-validation to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models, including the CNN model and CNN with an autoencoder. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a model will generalize to an independent data set by dividing the data into a series of subsets and using a different subset for validation each time. This method helps to reduce overfitting and gives a more reliable estimation of the model's performance. However, the context does not mention the use of a diverse dataset or stratified splitting. A diverse dataset, which includes data from different sources, locations, and conditions, can help to improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. Stratified splitting, which involves dividing the data into subsets while preserving the distribution of important variables, can also help to ensure that the model is able to generalize to new data. Despite these limitations, the use of cross-validation in this study is a positive step towards ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning models.
