Based on the provided context, there is no direct link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does mention the use of a fungal database resulting from the sampling of more than 100 permanent sampling plots over 20 years in Mediterranean forest ecosystems. This database was used in conjunction with machine learning algorithms to estimate and predict fungal productivity under different climate change scenarios and bioclimatic regions.

The study by Cejka et al. (2020) also used machine learning algorithms to predict the truffle cultivation potential in Central Europe under climate change. The study by Chang (2023) used machine/deep learning for biodiversity estimation by environment drivers. These studies further highlight the application of machine learning in ecological management and biodiversity estimation.

While the specific data repository link is not provided, the studies emphasize the importance of data sharing and reproducibility in scientific research. Therefore, it is possible that the data used in these studies are available in public repositories such as GBIF, Figshare, Zenodo, or Dryad. Researchers interested in accessing the data can contact the authors of the studies for more information.

Another potential source for the data could be the Omnibus de la Generalitat de Catalunya 2014-1 and the CEO report from 2014, which are mentioned in the context. These reports may contain information about the data and the sampling methods used in the study.

In summary, while there is no direct link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline, the fungal database used in the study is mentioned, and it is possible that the data are available in public repositories or through contacting the authors. Additionally, related reports and publications may provide further information about the data and methods used in the study.
