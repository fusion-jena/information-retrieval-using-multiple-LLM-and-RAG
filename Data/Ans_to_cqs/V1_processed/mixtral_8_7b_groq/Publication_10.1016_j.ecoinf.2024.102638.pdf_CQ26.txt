Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it is stated that the dataset is divided into training and test sets by random sampling, which helps to preserve the distribution of key features and target variables across both subsets and minimize the risk of bias. This method, while not specifically designed to address data bias, can contribute to reducing bias if the original dataset is already representative of the target population.

Additionally, the text mentions data filtering, which involves manually removing outliers and smoothing them with a moving average. Although this process is not directly related to addressing data bias, it can help improve data quality and reduce noise, which may have indirect positive effects on bias reduction.

To summarize, the provided context does not offer detailed information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. The dataset is divided using random sampling, and data filtering is applied to improve data quality. Still, there is no explicit mention of stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to tackle data bias.
