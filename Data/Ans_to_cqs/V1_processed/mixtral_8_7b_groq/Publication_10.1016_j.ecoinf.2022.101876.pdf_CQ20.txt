The context provided does not give specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, MegaDetector. However, it does mention that the model can process approximately 3.8 million images per day using specialized hardware and 16 NVIDIA V100 GPUs. This suggests that GPUs are used for processing the images, but it is not explicitly stated if they are also used for training the model. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot definitively answer what hardware resources are used for training the deep learning model.
