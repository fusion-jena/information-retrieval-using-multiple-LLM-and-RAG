Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in the described network system uses image data format as input. The system is designed for plant species recognition, and it classifies plant species images into 100 different categories. Therefore, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is specifically images.

The network system consists of several layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, a Fully Connected layer, an LSTM layer, and an output layer. The convolutional layers utilize 3 × 3 kernels for feature extraction, and the max-pooling layers reduce the dimensions of the input image using 2 × 2 kernels. After extracting spatial features, the model shifts to the LSTM layer to analyze time features. The LSTM layer's input size is reshaped to (196,512) for this purpose.

The context also discusses the structural elements of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and mentions several baseline architectures, such as AlexNet, PredNet, GoogLeNet, Overfeat, and VGG. These architectures have been successfully applied to various image recognition tasks. However, the specific data formats used in these architectures are not explicitly mentioned in the context. Considering their application in image recognition, it can be inferred that these architectures primarily use image data formats.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in the described network system uses image data format as input for plant species recognition. Other deep learning pipelines using CNNs may also primarily use image data formats, given their widespread application in image recognition tasks. However, the context does not provide information on the use of audio, video, or CSV data formats in deep learning pipelines.
