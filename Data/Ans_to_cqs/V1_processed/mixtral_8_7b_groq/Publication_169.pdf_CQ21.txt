Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the post-processing steps involved after the model training. However, it is mentioned that the training process took around 10 hours and the accuracy obtained reaches 95% on 140 epochs. The performance of the proposed model was measured, but the methods used for evaluation are not specified.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer regarding the post-processing steps such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix. However, these are common post-processing techniques used to analyze and interpret the performance of deep learning models.

Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the important regions of the input image that contribute to the model's prediction. Metrics calculation includes evaluating various performance measures like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model, showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the post-processing steps, it is possible that the authors used some or all of these techniques to evaluate the performance of their proposed CNN-LSTM model for plant species identification.
