Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized and then deployed on a suitable platform for use.

In the context, Jamali et al. (2023) used a variety of machine learning algorithms, including deep neural networks, to estimate leaf parameters for wheat leaves. It can be assumed that after training the deep learning model, the model was serialized, which involves saving the model architecture and weights to a file. Serialization allows for the model to be easily loaded and used in other applications.

As for the platform selection, the context does not provide specific details about where the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, it can be mentioned that the choice of platform would depend on the intended use of the model. For instance, if the model is to be used for real-time predictions, then a high-performance computing platform or cloud-based solution may be chosen. On the other hand, if the model is to be integrated into a larger software system, then the platform selection would depend on the system's requirements and compatibility with the model.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized and then deployed on a suitable platform based on the intended use of the model.
