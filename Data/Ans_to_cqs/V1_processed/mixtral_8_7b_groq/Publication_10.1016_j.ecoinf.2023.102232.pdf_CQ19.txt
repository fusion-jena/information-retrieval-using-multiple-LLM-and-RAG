The provided context does not mention any specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The computations were carried out using the DAFNE HPC scientific computing center, which provides Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) ProLiant DL560 Gen10 nodes equipped with Intel Xeon Gold 5118 processors and 512 GB of RAM. The Python 3.6.8 package Ray, version 1.9.2, was used to manage the two nodes in a parallel configuration. However, there is no information about the use of any deep learning libraries or frameworks. The methodology described in the text focuses on a least squares (LS) algorithm and a genetic algorithm for parameter estimation and optimization, but it does not involve deep learning.
