Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the contributions of various individuals in a research project, which include tasks such as writing, reviewing, editing, data curation, resources, project administration, validation, supervision, investigation, and visualization.

However, we can infer some possible steps that might have been taken based on common deep learning deployment practices.

Firstly, the deep learning model would have been trained and validated using a development platform, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras. Once the model has been trained and validated, it would need to be serialized so that it can be deployed on a target platform. Model serialization involves saving the model architecture, weights, and other relevant information in a file format that can be loaded and executed on a different platform. Common file formats for model serialization include HDF5, JSON, and Protocol Buffers.

After serializing the model, the researchers would need to select a platform for deployment. The choice of platform would depend on various factors, such as the intended use case, the required performance, and the available resources. Common deployment platforms for deep learning models include cloud services, such as AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud AI Platform, and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, as well as edge devices, such as smartphones, embedded systems, and IoT devices.

Once the platform has been selected, the researchers would need to integrate the serialized model into the target platform. This might involve writing code to load the model, preprocess input data, execute the model, and postprocess output data. The code might be written in a language such as Python, Java, or C++, depending on the target platform.

Finally, the researchers would need to test the deployed model to ensure that it is functioning correctly. This might involve running a set of test cases, measuring performance metrics, and validating the results against expected outcomes.

In summary, while there is no explicit information in the provided context about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, we can infer some possible steps based on common practices. These steps might include model serialization, platform selection, integration, and testing.
