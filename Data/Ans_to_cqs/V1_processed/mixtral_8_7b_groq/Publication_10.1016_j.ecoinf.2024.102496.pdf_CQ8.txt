I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context mainly discusses the Equitable Nutrient Reduction Decision Support Tool, which is a web-based tool designed to help decision-makers promote environmental equity by identifying areas with social vulnerabilities and high pollution loads. The tool offers a range of options for addressing specific pollutant issues, and it is available as a map package for download and use within a desktop GIS software suite.

The context also mentions the use of GIS and other tools in various studies related to environmental justice and green infrastructure. However, it does not provide information about the code repository for any deep learning pipelines used in these studies.

Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to your query. I recommend checking the project's official website or contacting the authors directly for more information about the code repository.
