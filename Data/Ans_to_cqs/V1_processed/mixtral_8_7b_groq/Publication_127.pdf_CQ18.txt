In summary, while the text does not provide specific information on the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training, it does mention that they used different architectures and an ensemble of models, and evaluated the performance of each model using a test set. They also published the final DNNs trained on the dataset and the software required to run their experiments as open-source code. Additionally, they used various state-of-the-art techniques in the field of deep learning.
