The text provided discusses the use of deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for image recognition tasks in the context of entomology. However, it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. 

Optimization techniques are crucial in deep learning as they help to minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance. Some commonly used optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam.

Based on the context provided, we can make some educated guesses about the optimization techniques used. For instance, the authors mention using the Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset for training, and the YOLOv5 model family, which suggests that they might have used the default optimization techniques provided by the YOLOv5 framework.

According to the YOLOv5 repository, the default optimizer is Adam with a learning rate of 0.01 and a weight decay of 0.0005. The learning rate is reduced by a factor of 0.1 after 50 and 80 epochs. Additionally, the authors mention using a NVIDIA A100 GPU from Google's cloud server, which suggests that they might have used other optimization techniques specific to GPU training.

Therefore, while the text does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used, we can infer that they might have used Adam as the default optimizer provided by the YOLOv5 framework. However, this is an educated guess based on the context provided, and the actual optimization techniques used may differ.
