The provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The pipeline was tested on a publicly available dataset of environmental microorganisms called EMDS-6, but the context does not mention where this dataset can be found or accessed. The dataset was divided into three sets, and one of these sets was used for training the EMViT-Net framework. However, the context does not provide a link to the repository where the dataset or the deep learning pipeline can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
