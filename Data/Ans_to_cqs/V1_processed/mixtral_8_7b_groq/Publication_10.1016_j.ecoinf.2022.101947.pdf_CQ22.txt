Based on the provided context, the performance of the classification model was evaluated using the metric of accuracy. The model was able to correctly predict the identity of 44 free-ranging Amur tigers, resulting in 100% accuracy.

The context also mentions that the optimal classification accuracy was obtained when the test set size was smallest relative to the training set. This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated by comparing the predicted values to the actual values in the test set, and the size of the test set was varied to determine the optimal size for training and testing the algorithm.

However, the context does not explicitly mention other metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made, while recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and provides a balanced measure of a model's performance.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that accuracy was used as a metric to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. Other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score may have also been used, but are not mentioned in the context.
