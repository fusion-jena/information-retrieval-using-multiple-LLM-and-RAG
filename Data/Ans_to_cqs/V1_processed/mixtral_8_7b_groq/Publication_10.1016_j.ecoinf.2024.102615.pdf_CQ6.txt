Based on the provided context, there are two preprocessing steps mentioned before training a deep learning model, namely batch normalization and dropout.

Firstly, batch normalization is used to accelerate the learning process. Batch normalization is a technique that normalizes the activations of the neurons in a layer for each mini-batch. This technique helps to reduce internal covariate shift, which is the change in the distribution of input values to a layer due to the change in parameters in the previous layers. By normalizing the activations, batch normalization helps to improve the stability and speed of the learning process.

Secondly, dropout is employed to mitigate model overfitting. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out a fraction of neurons in a layer during training. This technique helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons, which is the tendency of neurons to depend on each other for learning. By randomly dropping out neurons, dropout helps to promote the independence of neurons and improves the generalization of the model.

Additionally, it is worth noting that the input layer of the deep learning model consists of 4200 dimensions of spectral reflectance data, which suggests that some form of preprocessing may have been applied to the raw data before feeding it into the model. However, the context does not provide specific details about the preprocessing steps applied to the input data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include batch normalization and dropout.
