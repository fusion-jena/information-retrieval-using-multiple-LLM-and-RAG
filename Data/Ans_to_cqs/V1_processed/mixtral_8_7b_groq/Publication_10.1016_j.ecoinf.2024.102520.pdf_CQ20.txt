The provided context does not contain information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context consists of various research articles and tables related to soil substrates, agricultural practices, and spatial variability of agricultural soil parameters.

However, it is important to note that training deep learning models typically requires significant computational power, often provided by specialized hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). These hardware resources enable parallel processing of large datasets, which is essential for training deep learning models within a reasonable timeframe.

In summary, while the provided context does not contain information on the specific hardware resources used for training deep learning models, it is common practice to use specialized hardware such as GPUs or TPUs for this purpose.
