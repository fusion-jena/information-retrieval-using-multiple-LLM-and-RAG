The deep learning pipeline in question uses audio data as its input format. The audio data goes through a series of processing steps before being fed into the YAMNet model for extracting embeddings.

First, the audio is converted to a monophonic channel and resampled at 16 kHz. Then, the spectrogram is extracted using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) magnitudes of 25 ms overlapped by 15 ms. After that, the Mel spectrogram is calculated by mapping to 64 bins of the Mel scale within the range of 125â€“7500 Hz. Finally, the processed audio data is used as input to the YAMNet model for extracting the embeddings.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline works specifically with audio data and its corresponding spectrogram representations. Other data formats such as images, videos, or CSV files are not mentioned in the provided context.
