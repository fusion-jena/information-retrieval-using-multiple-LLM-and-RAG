Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. However, it does mention some steps related to training a model using machine learning and natural language processing techniques.

First, text preprocessing is performed, which includes steps like word segmentation and stop word removal (Tian et al., 2021). After preprocessing, a portion of the text is manually annotated for emotion accuracy verification (Tian et al., 2021).

In terms of model selection, the enhanced representation through knowledge integration (ERNIE) model is mentioned as achieving significant results in previous studies (Sun et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020). This model learns prior semantic relationships and word order features from massive amounts of data, enhancing its semantic representation (Sun et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020).

However, the context does not provide information on model serialization or platform selection for deployment. Model serialization involves converting the trained model into a format that can be stored and loaded for later use. Platform selection refers to choosing the appropriate hardware or software environment for deploying the model.
