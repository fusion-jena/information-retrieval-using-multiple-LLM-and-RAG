The criteria used to split the data for training a deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it does mention the use of the "caret" package's createDataPartition() function to allocate 80% of the data as test files and the remaining 20% as validation files for other models. This function is typically used for creating balanced splits of data, especially when dealing with categorical variables.

In the context of deep learning, data splitting is crucial for ensuring the model's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data. Common practices include splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

Given the use of the "caret" package and the createDataPartition() function, it can be inferred that a similar approach might have been used for splitting the data for deep learning model training as well. However, the exact criteria used for splitting the data for deep learning model training are not provided in the context.
