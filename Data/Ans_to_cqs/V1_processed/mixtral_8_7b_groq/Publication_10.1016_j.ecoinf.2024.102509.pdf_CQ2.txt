Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in this specific study involves the use of satellite imagery data.

The imagery used in the study was acquired from the Pleiades-1B satellite on January 28, 2020, and provided by Airbus Defence and Space. It is an ortho-rectified, multi-spectral dataset consisting of four spectral bands (blue, green, red, and near infrared) having a fine spatial resolution of 2 m and one panchromatic band (480â€“820 nm) having 0.50 m resolution.

This imagery was classified using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to obtain different hyperplanes on a multi-axial graph that can separate the data points into various classes with high precision. Specifically, eight land-use and land-cover (LULC) categories were recognized within the study area, viz. open mangrove, Casuarina plantation, mixed vegetation, herbaceous vegetation, bare earth and sand, built-up, waterbody and aquaculture.

Therefore, in this particular deep learning pipeline, the data format used is satellite imagery in the form of multi-spectral and panchromatic bands. It is worth noting that other deep learning pipelines may involve different data formats such as audio, video, or CSV, depending on the specific research question and data availability.
