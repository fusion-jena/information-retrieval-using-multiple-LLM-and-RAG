The provided context does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses a deep learning network called YOLOv8 and its improved version, UODN, which are used for detecting underwater objects. However, it does not mention where the data or code for these networks is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
