The provided context discusses the use of early stopping as a method to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for object detection. However, it does not explicitly mention other regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Early stopping is a form of regularization that involves monitoring the performance of the model on a validation set during training, and stopping the training process once the performance starts to degrade. This helps to prevent overfitting by stopping the model from becoming too specialized to the training data.

Dropout is another regularization technique that involves randomly dropping out, or "turning off," a fraction of the neurons in a layer during training. This helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons and promoting the learning of more robust features.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, involves adding a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This helps to prevent overfitting by discouraging large weight values and promoting the learning of more generalizable features.

In summary, while the provided context discusses the use of early stopping as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline, it does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization. However, these are common regularization techniques that can be used in addition to early stopping to further prevent overfitting.
