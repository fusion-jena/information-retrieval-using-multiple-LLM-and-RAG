Based on the provided context, there is no information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context focuses on the study of honey bee pollination and the use of different data types, such as LULC raster, MNT-Lidar, weather data, and databases of parcels and declared agricultural production. It discusses the importance of high-resolution data for accurate pollination models, but it does not mention any data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
