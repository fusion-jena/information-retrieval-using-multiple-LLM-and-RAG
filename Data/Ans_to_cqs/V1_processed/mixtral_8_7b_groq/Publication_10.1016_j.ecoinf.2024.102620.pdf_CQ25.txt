The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model such as classification, segmentation, or detection. The models mentioned in the text are the PLUS model, which uses a random forest algorithm to obtain development probabilities of each land use type, and the FLUS model, which uses an artificial neural network (ANN) to determine development probabilities based on one period of land use data. The deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are typically used for image analysis tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. However, based on the context provided, it appears that the focus is on land use change prediction using the PLUS and FLUS models, rather than deep learning models.
