Based on the provided context, it appears that the strategy to monitor model performance during training involves the use of a validation dataset and tracking the performance metric on this dataset after each epoch of training. This is a common approach in machine learning and deep learning to prevent overfitting and ensure the model's generalization ability.

In the context, we can see that the training process involves multiple epochs, where an epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset (indicated by the presence of the terms "epoch" and "training dataset" in the context). Furthermore, the context mentions the use of a validation dataset (indicated by the term "validation set" in the context), which is a separate dataset from the training dataset and is used to evaluate the model's performance during training.

The performance metric used to monitor the model's performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the context. However, it is common to use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or loss function value to monitor the model's performance during training. The metric value is calculated on the validation dataset after each epoch of training, and if the metric value does not improve or decreases for a certain number of epochs, the training process is stopped to prevent overfitting.

In summary, the strategy to monitor model performance during training involves using a validation dataset and tracking the performance metric on this dataset after each epoch of training. This approach helps to prevent overfitting and ensures the model's generalization ability.
