The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does discuss two indicators used to evaluate the effectiveness of models in correcting sampling bias: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and ΔD.

The AUC is a commonly used metric for evaluating the performance of binary classification models. It measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate. An AUC of 1 represents a perfect classifier, while an AUC of 0.5 represents a classifier that performs no better than random guessing.

The ΔD metric is not a standard evaluation metric for deep learning models and is specific to the context provided. It likely represents a measure of the difference in performance between a corrected model and an uncorrected model, although the exact calculation and interpretation of ΔD are not provided.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly answer the query regarding the evaluation metrics used for deep learning models, it does provide some insight into the metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of models in addressing sampling bias.
