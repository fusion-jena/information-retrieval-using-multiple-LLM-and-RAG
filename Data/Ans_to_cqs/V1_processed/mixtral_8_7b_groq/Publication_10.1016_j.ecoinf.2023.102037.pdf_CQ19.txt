The text does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework was used to build the model. However, it does mention that the model uses the default data augmentation techniques of YOLOv5. YOLOv5 is a deep learning model for object detection that is built on the PyTorch framework. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the deep learning model was built using the PyTorch framework.
