The provided context does not give specific details about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on high-definition satellite images to detect farm dams. It is likely that the authors took steps to ensure the training data was representative of the true distribution of farm dams in Australia.

The paper mentions that they used R for statistical analyses and data manipulation, and packages such as sf and raster for these tasks. It is possible that they used techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, or undersampling within these packages to address any class imbalance or other sources of bias in the data. However, without further information, this is only speculation.

Additionally, the authors mention that they used a variety of packages for plotting and data visualization, such as ggplot2, rasterVis, and cowplot. These packages would have been useful for exploring the data and identifying any potential sources of bias. It is possible that the authors used these packages to visualize the distribution of farm dams and ensure that the training data was representative.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that the authors took steps to ensure the training data was representative of the true distribution of farm dams in Australia. They may have used techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, or undersampling within R packages for data manipulation, and used data visualization packages to explore the data and ensure representativeness. However, this is speculation without further information.
