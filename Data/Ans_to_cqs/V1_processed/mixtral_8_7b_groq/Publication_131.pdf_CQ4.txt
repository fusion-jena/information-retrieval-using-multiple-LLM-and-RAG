In the provided context, data augmentation is performed on a sound database to create a more robust training set for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used in sound classification. However, the context does not explicitly mention specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, which are commonly used for image data.

Instead, the context describes a process where 10 additional audios are generated for each of the 865 audio samples in the database. These transformations are applied to the audio samples before they are converted into mel-spectrogram images for CNN training.

The data augmentation process involves generating variations of the original audio samples by applying transformations such as changing the pitch, tempo, and adding background noise. These transformations help increase the diversity of the training data and improve the CNN's ability to generalize to new, unseen sounds.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention specific data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling, it does describe a data augmentation process that involves transforming audio samples to generate variations that are used to train the CNN.
