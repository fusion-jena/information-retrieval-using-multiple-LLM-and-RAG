Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the described deep learning pipeline. The text describes the process of dividing the images from the Amazon and Cerrado databases into tiles, selecting a subset of those tiles for training, validation, and testing, and extracting patches from those tiles for input into the model. However, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques being applied during this process.

Additionally, the architecture of the deep learning model is described, including the use of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The input size of the model is specified as a tensor of size 15-by-15-by-16, but there is no mention of any data augmentation techniques being applied to increase the size or diversity of the training data.

It is worth noting that data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the size and diversity of the training data, and can help improve the performance and generalization of the model. However, based on the provided context, it does not appear that these techniques were used in this particular pipeline.
