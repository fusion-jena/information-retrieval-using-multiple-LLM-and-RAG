The pieces of context do not explicitly mention the specific method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the Random Forest (RF) model. However, it is mentioned that the RF model with 25 trees as hyperparameters achieved the highest accuracy. It can be inferred that the hyperparameter 25 (number of trees) was determined through a process of optimization, although the method is not specified.

In general, there are several methods to optimize hyperparameters in machine learning models, including grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves specifying a range of possible values for each hyperparameter and training the model with all possible combinations of these values. Random search, on the other hand, involves randomly selecting values for each hyperparameter from a specified range and training the model with these values. Bayesian optimization is a more sophisticated method that uses Bayesian inference to iteratively select values for hyperparameters that are likely to result in good model performance.

Without further information, it is not possible to determine which method was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the RF model in this study. However, it is clear that some form of hyperparameter optimization was performed to determine the number of trees in the RF model.
