Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context mainly discusses the classification systems used for land use and land cover (LU/LTA) and the challenges in distinguishing between certain shrub community configurations.

However, it is important to note that the selection of data splitting criteria is a crucial step in the development of any machine learning model, including deep learning models. Commonly used methods for splitting data include:

1. Random sampling: This involves randomly dividing the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. This method helps ensure that the data is representative of the entire population.
2. Time-series splitting: In cases where the data is collected over time, it may be more appropriate to use time-series splitting. This involves using the earliest data for training, the next portion for validation, and the most recent data for testing.
3. Stratified sampling: When the data is imbalanced, it may be necessary to use stratified sampling. This involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain characteristics, and then randomly sampling from each subgroup.

The choice of data splitting method depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the goals of the model. It is important to carefully consider these factors when developing a deep learning model.
