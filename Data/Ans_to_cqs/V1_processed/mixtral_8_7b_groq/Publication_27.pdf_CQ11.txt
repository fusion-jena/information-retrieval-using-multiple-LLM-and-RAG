I cannot provide a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the given context. However, the context does contain several digital object identifiers (DOIs) for various research resources. These DOIs are used to uniquely identify digital objects, such as datasets and papers, and can be used to access them through a data repository.

For example, the following DOIs are present in the context:

* 10.1109/TGRS.2023.3271104
* 10.1109/TGRS.2023.3271103
* 10.1109/TGRS.2023.3271099

These DOIs correspond to papers published in the IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing. To access the datasets associated with these papers, you can search for the DOIs in a data repository like IEEE DataPort or other relevant data repositories.

Additionally, the context also contains a link to a GitHub repository (<https://github.com/jakob-a-scholz/Deep-Learning-Pipeline-for-SAR-Ship-Detection>) which may contain the deep learning pipeline and related data. However, it is not guaranteed that the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline is provided in the GitHub repository.

Therefore, I would recommend searching for the DOIs and the GitHub repository to find the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. If you are unable to find it, I would suggest contacting the authors of the papers or the creators of the GitHub repository for further assistance.
