Based on the information provided, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used in the pipeline for landscape-related applications. Specifically, a CNN is used for the automatic recognition of woody regrowth vegetation in repeat landscape photographs (Cheshmehzangi, 2016; Urech et al., 2020). Additionally, a CNN is applied to extract and represent spatial attributes from 3D models created in widely used visualization tools for landscape planning (Guo et al., 2023). However, there is no mention of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers being used in the described pipelines.

Another study by Ho (2023) introduced LaDeco, a tool to analyze visual landscape elements, but the specific type of deep learning model used in this tool is not mentioned in the context.

In summary, based on the given context, a CNN is the type of deep learning model used in the described pipelines for landscape-related applications.
