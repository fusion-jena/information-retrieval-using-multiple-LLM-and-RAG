Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some implicit indications that can provide some insights.

Firstly, the study by Shahinfar et al. (2020) mentions that the model evaluation was performed on two datasets, which are smaller than the ImageNet dataset used for pre-trained models. This suggests that the authors might have used a diverse dataset for training and testing the model.

Secondly, the study by Simoes et al. (2023) mentions that the selection of an optimal model would also be governed by experimentation, which could include techniques like cross-validation. Cross-validation is a commonly used technique to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

Thirdly, the study by Stancic et al. (2022) compares the classification efficiency of pre-trained deep CNN models on camera trap images. The use of pre-trained models suggests that the authors might have used transfer learning, which is a technique to improve the generalizability of the model by leveraging the knowledge gained from a related task.

Finally, the study by Sun et al. (2017) mentions the unreasonable effectiveness of data in deep learning. This suggests that the authors might have used a large and diverse dataset to train the model, which can help improve the model's generalizability.

In conclusion, while there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the studies suggest the use of diverse datasets, transfer learning, and possibly cross-validation and large datasets. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
