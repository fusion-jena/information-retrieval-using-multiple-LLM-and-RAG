Based on the provided context, the text does not contain information about the performance metrics of a deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. The context focuses on the use of the Geographical Detector (GD) method for analyzing the spatial variability of kNDVI (kernel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and identifying the explanatory power of different driver factors.

The Geographical Detector method involves calculating the Q value, which reflects the explanatory power of each driver factor. The Q value ranges between 0 and 1, with a higher Q value indicating a stronger ability of the influencing factor to explain the kNDVI. The calculation of the Q value involves the use of several variables, such as the number of strata for each driver factor (L), the sample size of each driver factor within stratum h and the entire region (Nh and N), the variance in the kNDVI in the h-th stratum and the whole region (σ2h and σ2), and the square sum of the kNDVI within stratum h and the entire region (SSWh and SST).

The text also mentions the use of a time variable and the calculation of the slope of the kNDVI trend over time. The slope is used to categorize the kNDVI trends into four types based on the criteria outlined in Table 3.

Therefore, while the text provides information on the use of the Geographical Detector method for analyzing the spatial variability of kNDVI and identifying the explanatory power of different driver factors, it does not contain information about the performance metrics of a deep learning model.
