Based on the provided context, the deep learning model is used for the purpose of object detection, specifically for shark detection in underwater environments.

The model uses a NASnet architecture with a Faster-rcnn backbone, implemented in Tensorflow2. This architecture is commonly used for object detection tasks, where the model is trained to identify and locate objects within an image. In this case, the objects of interest are sharks.

The model was trained on a dataset of images that were resized to 1333 Ã— 800 pixels to match with the pre-training data used to prepare the first layers of the model. During the training phase, both shark and non-shark species were included to enhance the ability of the CNN to build pertinent feature embeddings. The non-shark species were commonly associated with or exhibited resemblances to the studied shark species.

The performance of the deep-learning models was evaluated by computing the recall, precision, and F-measure for each model. These metrics are commonly used in object detection tasks to assess the accuracy of the model in identifying and locating objects within an image.

Overall, the purpose of the deep learning model is to detect and identify the presence of sharks in underwater environments. This has important implications for marine ecology, as it can help researchers to better understand the distribution and behavior of shark populations in different habitats.
