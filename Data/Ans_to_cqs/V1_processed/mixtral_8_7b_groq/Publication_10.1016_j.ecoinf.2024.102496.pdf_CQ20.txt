Based on the provided context, there is no information about the use of hardware resources for training a deep learning model. The context discusses various topics related to water quality and nutrient reduction in Florida's HUC-12 watersheds, including WBIDs, TMDL approach, pollutant loads, and the equitable nutrient reduction decision support tool. However, there is no mention of deep learning models or the hardware resources used for training them. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
