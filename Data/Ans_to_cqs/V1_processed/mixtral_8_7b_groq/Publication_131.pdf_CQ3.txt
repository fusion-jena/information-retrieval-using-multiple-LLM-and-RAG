The provided context does not give information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe a deep learning pipeline for sound classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

The pipeline includes data augmentation, where for each of the 865 audio samples in the database, 10 additional audios were generated through transformations such as rotations and size modifications. These transformations were reflected in the mel-spectrogram images, which were used as input to the CNN.

The CNN structure consisted of three convolution layers, each with a different number of output filters (32, 64, and 128) and a kernel size of 3 Ã— 3. A fully connected layer with 512 neurons and a softmax layer with the number of units for classification (one for each type of sound) were also included in the CNN.

For network training, 80% of the samples were used as training samples, and 20% as tests. A balanced sampling was carried out for the test set, where one audio sample (with its corresponding data augmentation samples) out of 5 was selected for each type of anuran call.

In summary, while the provided context does not give information about data annotation techniques, it does describe a deep learning pipeline for sound classification using CNNs, including data augmentation and network training strategies.
