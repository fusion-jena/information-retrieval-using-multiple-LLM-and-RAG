I don't have enough information to determine the exact data repository for the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context provided, we know that the image dataset used in the study, called Benthoz15, is a combination of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. The Western Australia (WA) subset of this dataset was used for training the classifier, which consists of 4,750 images with 237,500 expert-annotated points collected over a span of 3 years (2011 to 2013).

The pre-processing step involved applying color channel stretch to each image in the dataset. The specific percentiles were calculated for each color channel, and the intensities were adjusted accordingly. However, there is no mention of where the dataset or the code for the deep learning pipeline is stored or shared.

In order to access the data repository, I would recommend looking for the original Benthoz15 dataset or contacting the authors directly. The authors have published their work in several conferences, such as the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) and the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). They may have made the dataset and code available through one of these venues or their personal websites.
