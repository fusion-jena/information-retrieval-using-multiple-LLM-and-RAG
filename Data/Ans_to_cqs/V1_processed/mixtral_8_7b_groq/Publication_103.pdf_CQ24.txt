Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as using a random seed value. However, the context does mention the use of specific initialization techniques and transfer learning methods.

In the study, the researchers used two different initialization strategies: random initialization and pre-training on ImageNet. Random initialization (R.CR.CR) involves initializing the neural network's weights randomly and then training it on the Costa-Rica leaf scans training set. On the other hand, pre-training on ImageNet (I.CR.CR) means initializing the neural network's weights using a model pre-trained on the generalist dataset ImageNet, followed by fine-tuning on the Costa-Rica leaf scans training set.

Moreover, the context also discusses transfer learning, which can be seen as another strategy to handle randomness. Transfer learning is employed across herbarium data from different regions (H1K.PC.PC, H1KI.PC.PC, and Herbarium1K) and from herbarium data to non-dried plant images (CRLeaves and PlantCLEF). Transfer learning helps in reducing the impact of randomness by leveraging pre-existing knowledge from one task or dataset and applying it to a new, related task or dataset.

While these strategies do not directly address randomness in the deep learning pipeline related to random seed values, they do help in improving model performance and reducing the impact of randomness in other ways.
