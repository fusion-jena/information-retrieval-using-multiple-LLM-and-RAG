The provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of a penalized loss function with an L1 penalty for shrinkage estimation and variable selection during the training phase. The model's performance is expected to be robust against heterogeneous observations, which is a common issue in crowdsourcing data analysis.

In general, the process of deploying a trained deep learning model involves several steps:

1. Model serialization: This step involves saving the trained model's architecture, weights, and biases to a file. This file can be used to recreate the model without having to retrain it. There are several formats available for model serialization, such as HDF5, JSON, and YAML.

2. Platform selection: The deployed model can be hosted on various platforms depending on the use case. For instance, if the model is to be used in a web application, it can be hosted on a server and integrated with the application using an API. If the model is to be used for batch processing, it can be deployed on a cluster of machines using a distributed computing framework such as Apache Hadoop or Spark.

3. Model validation: Before deploying the model, it is essential to validate it using a separate dataset that was not used during the training phase. This step ensures that the model's performance is robust and generalizable.

4. Model monitoring: After deploying the model, it is crucial to monitor its performance regularly. This step involves tracking the model's predictions, identifying any biases or errors, and retraining the model as needed.

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the model was trained using a penalized loss function with an L1 penalty for shrinkage estimation and variable selection. The model's performance is expected to be robust against heterogeneous observations, which is a common issue in crowdsourcing data analysis. However, the specifics of the model deployment process are not provided.
