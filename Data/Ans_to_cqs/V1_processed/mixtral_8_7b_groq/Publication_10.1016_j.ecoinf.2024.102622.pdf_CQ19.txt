The provided context does not explicitly mention the deep learning framework used to build the model presented in the paper "A lightweight rice disease identification network based on attention mechanism and dynamic convolution" by Yang et al., 2023.

However, it is mentioned that the model uses an attention mechanism and dynamic convolution, which are techniques that can be implemented using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

TensorFlow is a widely-used open-source library for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning, developed by Google Brain Team. It provides a comprehensive and flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.

PyTorch, on the other hand, is an open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, which is used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. It is primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab.

Without further information, it is not possible to determine which of these two popular deep learning frameworks was used to build the model presented in the paper.
