The specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model is likely to be a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or a variant suitable for image classification tasks, given the nature of the data (footprint images) and the reference to Kistner et al. (2021).

In the study by Kistner et al. (2021), a deep learning model was used to classify three sympatric otter species using footprint images. Although the exact model type is not specified, the study highlights the potential of utilizing lower quality data effectively, suggesting the use of a model capable of handling various image qualities. CNNs are commonly used for image classification tasks due to their ability to extract features from images through convolutional layers, making them a strong candidate for this study.

Moreover, the study by Gu et al. (2014) on sex determination of Amur tigers from footprints in snow, which is referenced in the provided context, used a machine learning approach for classification. While they used Random Forests for their study, it does not exclude the possibility of using deep learning models for footprint classification in other studies.

In summary, based on the provided context, the specific deep learning model used is not explicitly mentioned. However, considering the nature of the data and the reference to a study using machine learning for footprint classification, it is likely that a Convolutional Neural Network or a similar model suitable for image classification tasks was used in the pipeline.
