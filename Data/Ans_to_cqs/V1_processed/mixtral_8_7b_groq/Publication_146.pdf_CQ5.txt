The pieces of context provided do not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention the use of synthetic aperture radar data for ocean object classification and the creation of a custom dataset for car detection in aerial images using convolutional neural networks.

In the study related to arXiv:1910.07234, the authors created their own dataset for car detection in aerial images using convolutional neural networks. The dataset was created due to the lack of existing quality data. Despite the dataset being relatively small in a deep learning context, the model still yielded good detection capabilities under difficult circumstances and complex backgrounds.

In the study related to arXiv:1910.05446, the authors used synthetic aperture radar data for ocean object classification. However, it is not clear whether they used any existing datasets or created their own.

Therefore, while the pieces of context do mention the use of custom datasets, they do not provide information on the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
