The text provided discusses two datasets used in a deep learning pipeline for rice disease detection, but it does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting the raw data. However, it can be inferred that one of the datasets, the PlantVillage dataset, is a public dataset. Public datasets are often created by aggregating data from various sources, which can include surveys, sensors, or other types of data collection methods.

The PlantVillage dataset is used to pre-train the network's weights, suggesting that it contains a large number of images of healthy and diseased rice plants. This dataset was created by Hughes and Salathe in 2016 and has been widely used in research related to plant disease detection. The exact methods used to collect the data for this dataset are not specified in the text, but it is mentioned that the dataset includes images of rice plants, which implies that image data was collected for this dataset.

The second dataset mentioned in the text is the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset, which is used to train the final model for diagnosing rice leaf diseases in the field. This dataset was created by Hossain in 2023, but the text does not provide information on how the data was collected for this dataset.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that public datasets, such as the PlantVillage dataset, are used in this pipeline. Public datasets are often created by aggregating data from various sources, which can include surveys, sensors, or other types of data collection methods. However, the exact methods used to collect the raw data for the PlantVillage dataset and the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset are not specified in the text.
