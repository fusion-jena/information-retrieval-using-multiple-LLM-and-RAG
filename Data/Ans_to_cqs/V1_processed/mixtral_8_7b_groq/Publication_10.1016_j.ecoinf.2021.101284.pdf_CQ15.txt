The provided context does not include information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for early diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. The paper by Castillo (2020) discusses the use of a deep learning algorithm for diagnosing COVID-19 based on X-ray and computed tomography images. However, it does not mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

The other papers and sources provided in the context discuss different topics, such as linearity assessment, air pollution, and the course of COVID-19 cases. They do not provide information on optimization techniques used in deep learning.

In deep learning, optimization techniques are used to minimize the loss function and find the optimal set of weights for the model. Some commonly used optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad. However, the specific optimization technique used depends on the problem and the deep learning architecture.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for early diagnosis of COVID-19 patients.
