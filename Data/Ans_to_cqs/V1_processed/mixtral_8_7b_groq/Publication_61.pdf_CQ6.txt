Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved, including normalization, resizing, and in some cases, data augmentation techniques such as flipping or rotation.

In the context provided, the authors mention that the patches of images used for training are resized to a specific dimension (32x32) and normalized. Normalization is a common preprocessing step in deep learning that involves scaling the input data to a range that is suitable for the model. This can help improve the model's convergence and overall performance.

Additionally, the authors also use data augmentation techniques such as vertical and horizontal flipping during training. Data augmentation is a powerful technique that can help improve the accuracy of deep learning models by artificially increasing the size of the training set. By flipping the patches horizontally or vertically, the model is exposed to different variations of the same image, which can help it learn more robust features.

It is important to note that other preprocessing steps such as cleaning or scaling may also be necessary, depending on the specific use case and the quality of the data. However, the context provided does not mention any other preprocessing steps beyond resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.

In summary, before training a deep learning model, it is common to perform preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation. These steps can help improve the model's performance and accuracy by preparing the data in a suitable format for the model and increasing the size and variability of the training set.
