The provided context discusses the use of machine learning models, including random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR), for predicting algal-related parameters such as chlorophyll-a in water quality datasets. It also explains the significance of various parameters in improving model performance, such as the kernel function, epsilon, regularization parameter (C), and degree. However, the context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot answer the query regarding the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines.
