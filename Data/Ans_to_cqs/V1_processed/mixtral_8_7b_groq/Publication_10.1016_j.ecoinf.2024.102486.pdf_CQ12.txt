The provided context does not specify the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions the use of deep learning tools and techniques such as the Deep Learning Toolbox by MathWorks, cuDNN, and Darknet. These tools can be used to implement various types of deep learning models including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers. Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
