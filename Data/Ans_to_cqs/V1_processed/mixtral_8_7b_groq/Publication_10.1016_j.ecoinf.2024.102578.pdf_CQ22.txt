The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics are based on true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN).

Accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions in the whole data set. Precision is the proportion of images that the model classified as a specific category C that are actually category C. Recall is the proportion of images that are actually a specific category C that the model classified as C. The F1 score is the weighted average of precision and recall.

In the context of the image quality model, precision and recall are calculated for each location (Finnmark and Yamal) and for each image quality category (Bad and Good). For example, the precision for the Bad category in Finnmark is 0.920, which means that 92% of the images that the model classified as Bad in Finnmark are actually Bad. The recall for the Good category in Yamal is 0.988, which means that 98.8% of the images that are actually Good in Yamal were classified as Good by the model.

The F1 score is also calculated for each location and category. The F1 score for the Bad category in Finnmark is 0.915, which indicates a high level of accuracy for this category in this location.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model and to compare the performance of different models. In this case, separate two-class models were trained for Finnmark and Yamal using the keras package in R with a TensorFlow backend. The ResNet-50 architecture was used to train the models, and the performance was evaluated using precision, recall, and F1 score. The results show that the models perform well, with high precision and recall for both locations and categories.

In summary, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics are based on true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. In the context of the image quality model, precision and recall are calculated for each location and category, and the F1 score is also calculated. The results show that the models perform well, with high precision and recall for both locations and categories.
