The deep learning model in question is used for semantic segmentation, specifically for Green View Index (GVI) learning. This model is employed in GreenCam, a system designed to measure photo GVI using SegFormer, a state-of-the-art Transformer-based model for semantic segmentation.

Semantic segmentation is a process where a model classifies each pixel in an image into a specific category. In the case of SegFormer, it follows an encoder-decoder structure, combining a Transformer-based encoder (MiT) with a lightweight decoder (ALL-MLP) composed entirely of multilayer perceptron (MLP) blocks.

The purpose of using this deep learning model for semantic segmentation in GreenCam is to facilitate GVI extraction. GVI is a measure of the amount and distribution of green vegetation in an image or a scene. By classifying pixels into specific categories, the model can accurately determine the presence and extent of green vegetation, thereby calculating the GVI.

The model's effectiveness is evident in its performance on the UGE-D dataset, where it outperforms other widely-used segmenters like FCN, HRNet, PSPNet, and DeepLabV3+ in terms of mIOU, accuracy, and F1-score. Despite being slightly inferior in inference time and parameters compared to models with MobileNetV2, SegFormer demonstrates the strongest overall performance when considering segmentation performance.

Therefore, the deep learning model in GreenCam serves the purpose of accurately segmenting urban scenes for GVI learning, providing a robust and efficient method for measuring green vegetation in urban environments.
