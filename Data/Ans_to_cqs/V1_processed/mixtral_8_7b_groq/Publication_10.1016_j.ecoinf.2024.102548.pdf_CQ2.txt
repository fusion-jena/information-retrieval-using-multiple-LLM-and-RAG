While the given context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it does provide information about the types of models employed and the nature of the tasks they are used for. Given that these models are primarily convolutional neural networks (CNNs), it is reasonable to infer that the primary data format used is likely to be images.

The context mentions models like VGG-19, InceptionV3, ResNet-50, and InceptionResNetV2, all of which are well-known CNN architectures designed for image classification tasks. For instance, VGG-19 is recognized for its effectiveness in intricate pattern recognition, suggesting that it is used for image data.

However, the context does not exclude the possibility of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV being used. It's just that the main focus appears to be on image data, given the models mentioned. If the study involved other types of data, the context would likely have mentioned models suitable for those data formats, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data like audio or video.

In conclusion, while the context does not provide explicit information about the data formats used, it strongly suggests that images are the primary data format based on the models mentioned. Other data formats like audio, video, or CSV might also be used, but this is not indicated in the provided context.
