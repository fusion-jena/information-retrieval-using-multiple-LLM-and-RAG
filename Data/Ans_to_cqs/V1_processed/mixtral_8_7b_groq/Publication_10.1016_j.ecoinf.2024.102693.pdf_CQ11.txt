I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on introducing different models used in deep learning, such as ResNet, Transformer-like models (ViT, Volo, ViP), and ensemble methods (VecEnsemble, MatEnsemble). It also includes tables comparing the classification performance of these models and their training hyper-parameters. However, there is no mention of the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
