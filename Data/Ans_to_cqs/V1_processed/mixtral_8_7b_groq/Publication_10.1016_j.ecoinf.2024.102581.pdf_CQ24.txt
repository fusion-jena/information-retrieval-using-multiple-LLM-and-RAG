The provided context discusses various aspects of deep learning pipelines, including the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for plant image classification. However, it does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline using a specific random seed value.

However, we can infer some strategies related to handling randomness in the pipeline from the context:

1. Hyperparameter Tuning: The authors explore a search space of CNN hyperparameters, including the number of filters, filter size, number of neurons, batch size, epochs, and the CNN model optimizer. These hyperparameters can be initialized with different random values in each iteration. By setting a fixed random seed value, the randomness in the initialization process can be controlled, ensuring reproducibility of results.

2. Data Augmentation: The authors use data augmentation techniques such as random rotation, random cropping, random flipping, random color jittering, and random noise addition. These techniques introduce randomness in the training data, helping the model generalize better. By setting a fixed random seed value, the same set of augmented data can be generated across different runs, ensuring consistent results.

3. Model Complexity: The authors approximate the total complexity of their proposed approach as O(TC*NP), where TC represents the maximum number of iterations and NP represents the population size. By setting a fixed random seed value, the randomness in the selection of the initial population can be controlled, leading to consistent results.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline using a specific random seed value, we can infer that setting a fixed random seed value for hyperparameter initialization, data augmentation, and model complexity can help control randomness and ensure reproducibility of results.
