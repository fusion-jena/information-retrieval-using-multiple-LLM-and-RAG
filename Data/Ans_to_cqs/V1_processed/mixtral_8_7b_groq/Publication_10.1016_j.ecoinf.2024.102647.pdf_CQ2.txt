Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in the study for soil salinity distribution mapping in Lake Urmia, Iran uses raster data as input. Specifically, the algorithm uses normalized difference salinity index (NDSI), depth of groundwater (DTGW), aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), distance from dam (DFD), land cover (LC), slope, plain curvature, climate type, and land use (LU) as data formats. These variables are likely derived from remote sensing data, such as satellite imagery, and are used to predict soil salinity distribution. However, the context does not explicitly mention other data formats like image, audio, video, or CSV. Therefore, based on the given information, the deep learning pipeline uses primarily raster data formats for soil salinity distribution mapping.
