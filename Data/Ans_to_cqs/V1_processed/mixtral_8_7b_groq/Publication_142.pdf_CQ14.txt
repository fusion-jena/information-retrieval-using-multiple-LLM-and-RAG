The provided context does not give information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other method for hyperparameter tuning. The context mainly focuses on the process of collecting and filtering a dataset of plant images from Flickr for use in training and testing machine learning models for plant identification. While it does mention the use of the Pl@ntNet identification system, it does not go into detail about the optimization of its hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
