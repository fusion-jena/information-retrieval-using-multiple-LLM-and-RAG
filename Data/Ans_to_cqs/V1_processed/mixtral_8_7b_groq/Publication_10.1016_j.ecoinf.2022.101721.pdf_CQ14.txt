The provided context does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of methods such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization techniques. However, the context does mention the use of Bayesian algorithms for statistical modeling in the study of bat identification.

In the context, it is stated that implementing Bayesian algorithms and allowing users to interact with the software should significantly improve the performance of automated bat ID. This suggests that the optimization of hyperparameters in the Bayesian model may be influenced by user input and local conditions.

The context also mentions that the code used in the study takes into account important local conditions which cannot be ignored. This implies that the optimization of hyperparameters may be dependent on these local conditions, and that the model may be adjusted accordingly.

However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
