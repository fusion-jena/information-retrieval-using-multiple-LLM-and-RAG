The provided context does not contain information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context includes information about various machine learning methods, such as linear regression, support vector machine for regression, gradient boosting algorithm, and ensemble learning method. It also mentions specific tools and datasets used for data processing and analysis. However, it does not provide any details about data annotation techniques used in deep learning.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a box around an object in an image to identify it. This is commonly used for object detection tasks.
2. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image to categorize it. This is commonly used for image segmentation tasks.
3. Instance segmentation: This technique involves both object detection and semantic segmentation. It involves identifying and labeling each instance of an object in an image.
4. Classification: This technique involves labeling an entire image or a region of interest within an image with a single label.
5. Regression: This technique involves predicting a continuous value for a given input.

These techniques are used to train deep learning models by providing them with labeled data. The models then learn to recognize patterns in the data and make predictions based on those patterns. The choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the type of data being used.
