The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the BERT model was evaluated using the F1 score, a harmonic mean of precision and recall, as the primary metric. The relationship between the number of texts in training data and the median F1 achieved by classifiers was examined in Figure 4. Additionally, Figure 5 shows the performance of classifiers when trained with different selection strategies, such as Bert K-means, Least Confidence, and random selection. Lastly, Table 2 presents the performance of Classification Task 2 when trained and tested with either stratified or non-stratified social media datasets. These evaluations provide insights into the model's performance during the training process.
