The provided context does not discuss the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline for predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration. However, it does mention that various water quality parameters, temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure are considered as input variables for the model. It is likely that these data are organized in a structured format, such as a CSV file, where each row represents a unique observation and each column represents a different variable.

Moreover, the context cites several studies that have applied machine learning and deep learning techniques for predicting DO concentration. For instance, Heddam et al. (2022b) used long-short term memory (LSTM) deep learning for predicting DO concentration in a river, while Arepalli and Naik (2024) applied deep learning-based AODEGRU for water contamination analysis in IoT-enabled aquaculture. These studies do not explicitly mention the data formats used in their deep learning pipelines. However, it can be inferred that they used a structured format, such as a CSV file, to organize their input variables.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly answer the query, it can be inferred that structured data formats, such as CSV files, are likely used in the deep learning pipeline for predicting DO concentration.
