The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning frameworks were used to build the model. However, it is mentioned that the models were implemented using the scikit-learn library, which is a machine learning library for Python and not specifically designed for deep learning. Therefore, it is unlikely that scikit-learn was used to build a deep learning model.

Deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Caffe are commonly used to build deep learning models. These frameworks provide the necessary tools and functionalities to design, train, and validate deep learning models.

Given that the models were implemented using Python and the code is released open source, it is possible to infer the deep learning framework used by examining the code in the Git repository. However, this information is not provided in the context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which deep learning frameworks were used to build the model.
