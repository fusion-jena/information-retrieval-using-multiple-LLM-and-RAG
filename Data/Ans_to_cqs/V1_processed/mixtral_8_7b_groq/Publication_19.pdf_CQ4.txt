Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the data is highly unbalanced and the use of SMOTE or similar data balancing techniques may help improve the results. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) is a data augmentation technique used to balance class distributions in imbalanced datasets.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling, it does imply the use of SMOTE for data balancing. It is important to note that data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used for image data to increase the size of the training set, improve model generalization, and reduce overfitting. However, the context does not provide enough information to confirm the use of these techniques in this specific deep learning pipeline.
