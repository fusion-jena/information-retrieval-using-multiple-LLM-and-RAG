The provided context discusses a deep-learning architecture for toxicovigilance but does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the model is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and that it uses a confusion matrix as a performance metric.

Confusion matrices are typically used for classification problems, and they require categorical labels for each input sample. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data used for training the RNN model is likely annotated with categorical labels.

Common data annotation techniques for deep learning include:

1. Image classification: assigning a categorical label to an entire image.
2. Object detection: identifying and locating objects within an image using bounding boxes.
3. Semantic segmentation: dividing an image into regions based on the object or material present in each region.
4. Instance segmentation: identifying and segmenting individual instances of objects within an image.

Given the focus on honey bee flight activity data, it is possible that the data annotation techniques used in this study involve some form of object detection or semantic/instance segmentation to identify and track individual honey bees or their behaviors. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that categorical labels are used for training the RNN model. Common data annotation techniques for deep learning include image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. The specific techniques used in this study are not specified.
