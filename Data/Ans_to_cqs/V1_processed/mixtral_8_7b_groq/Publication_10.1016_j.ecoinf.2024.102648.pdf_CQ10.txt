Based on the information provided, there is no mention of a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used for predicting Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD) in upland cotton. The figures and text provided discuss the use of various deep learning methods, such as the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), for predicting CLCuD incidence. The MLP model achieved a training accuracy of 0.80 and an R^2 value of 0.82. However, there is no information given about where the code for this deep learning pipeline can be found. It is possible that the code is not publicly available or was not included in the provided context.
