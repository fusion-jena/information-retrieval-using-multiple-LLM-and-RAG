The provided context does not contain specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does provide information about a study involving the construction of provincial-scale fitting models and the use of a dataset for ecological informatics.

In the study, the authors used a dataset to analyze the relationship between energy consumption and CO2 emissions in Xi'an, China. The dataset includes nine categories of energy consumption, such as raw coal, crude oil, and natural gas, and is converted to standard coal consumption based on their calorific value.

However, the text does not mention any specific techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as:

1. Diverse dataset: Using a dataset that includes a wide range of examples and is representative of the population the model will be applied to.
2. Cross-validation: A technique where the dataset is split into multiple subsets, and the model is trained and tested on each subset. This helps to ensure that the model performs well on new, unseen data.
3. Stratified splitting: A technique where the dataset is split in a way that ensures each subset has a similar distribution of examples. This can help to ensure that the model is not biased towards any particular subset of the data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
