Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline for fish classification by species. However, it is mentioned that data augmentation was used, where the original dataset was increased by a factor of 12. Data augmentation is a common technique used to prevent overfitting by increasing the amount of training data and providing the model with more variability.

Additionally, two trained models were used, which could imply that some form of model ensemble was employed. Model ensembles can help reduce overfitting by combining the predictions of multiple models, which can lead to better generalization performance.

However, without further information, it is not possible to confirm whether other regularization methods such as dropout, L2 regularization, or early stopping were used in this deep learning pipeline.
