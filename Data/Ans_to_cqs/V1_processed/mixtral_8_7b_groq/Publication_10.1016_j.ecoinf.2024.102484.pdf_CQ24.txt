The provided pieces of context do not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention the use of deep learning in monitoring ecosystem service change and assessing land degradation.

In the context of monitoring ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen, Huang et al. (2019) used high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning. While they do not explicitly mention how they handled randomness in their deep learning pipeline, it is common practice in deep learning to use a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.

Jiang et al. (2019) assessed land degradation and quantified its drivers in the Amudarya River delta, but they did not use deep learning in their study.

Kavian et al. (2014) studied the effects of deforestation on soil properties, runoff, and erosion in northern Iran, but they did not use deep learning or discuss strategies for handling randomness in machine learning pipelines.

Kopittke et al. (2019) discussed soil and the intensification of agriculture for global food security, but they did not use deep learning or discuss strategies for handling randomness in machine learning pipelines.

The limitations section mentions the use of the geographical detector, which requires a large size of geographic samples, and the need to process data from the Basic Soil Property Dataset of High-resolution China Soil Information Grids and HWSD jointly to improve temporal and spatial accuracy. However, it does not mention any strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

The conclusions section emphasizes the need to reduce the frequency of anthropogenic disturbance in forests and increase protection for natural areas and mature forests.

Therefore, while the provided context discusses the use of deep learning in monitoring ecosystem service change and assessing land degradation, it does not directly address strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. It is common practice in deep learning to use a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.
