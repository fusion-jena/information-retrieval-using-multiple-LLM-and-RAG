Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning of the data before training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the models were trained using the L2 loss determined on the predicted and observed RGBI channels, ignoring the cloud-contaminated pixels. This implies that some form of preprocessing related to handling cloud-contaminated pixels was performed.

Additionally, the EarthNetScore is used for validation, and the learning rate and batch size are set to specific values, indicating that some preprocessing or preparation of the data for the model was done. The models were implemented using PyTorch Lightning, which is built on top of PyTorch and enables improved scalability. PyTorch provides various data loading and preprocessing capabilities, so it is possible that such preprocessing steps were implemented using PyTorch's data loading features.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit details on the preprocessing steps performed on the data, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing related to handling cloud-contaminated pixels was carried out. Furthermore, the use of PyTorch Lightning suggests that standard data loading and preprocessing techniques available in PyTorch were likely utilized.
