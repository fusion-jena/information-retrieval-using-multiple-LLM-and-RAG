The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that in the context of remote sensing for forestry and science, satellite images are used for training and validating a deep learning model.

In the remote sensing study mentioned, satellite images for sites #1, #3, #5, #7-10 were used for training and sites #2, #4, #6 for validation. These images were randomly cropped into sub-images of size 256 Ã— 256, which were then used to create batches of data for training the neural network. Corresponding batches of mask data, with shape (20, 256, 256, 1), were also used in the training process.

Therefore, it can be inferred that in the context of remote sensing for forestry and science, satellite images are used as the raw data for the deep learning pipeline. These images are likely obtained through satellite sensors, although the specific sensors or methods used are not mentioned in the provided context.

It's also worth noting that the study mentions the potential of deep learning approaches in vegetation science and encourages further investigations in this area. This suggests that there may be other sources of raw data, such as public datasets or surveys, that could be used in deep learning pipelines for vegetation science and related fields.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that satellite images obtained through sensors are used in the context of remote sensing for forestry and science. Additionally, the study encourages further investigations into the use of deep learning approaches in vegetation science, which may involve the use of other sources of raw data.
