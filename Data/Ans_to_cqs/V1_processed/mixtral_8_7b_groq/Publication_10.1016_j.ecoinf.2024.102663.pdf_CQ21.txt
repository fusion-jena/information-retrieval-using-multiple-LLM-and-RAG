Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention some metrics that are calculated during the validation stage, such as precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP) for different IoU thresholds (mAP50 and mAP50-95).

From the context, it appears that the models are used for object detection (YOLOv8) and regression tasks (depth estimation and biomass estimation). Therefore, it is possible that postprocessing steps for these models may include:

1. Object Detection:
* Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS): To eliminate duplicate detections of the same object by selecting the bounding box with the highest confidence score.
* Confusion Matrix: To evaluate the performance of the object detection model by comparing the predicted classes with the ground truth labels.
2. Regression Tasks:
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): To evaluate the performance of the regression models.
* Plotting residuals: To check the assumptions of the regression models, such as linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals.
* Calibration curves: To assess the reliability of the predicted values by comparing the predicted probabilities with the observed frequencies.

Therefore, based on the provided context and the nature of the tasks, it can be inferred that postprocessing steps may include NMS, confusion matrix, MAE, RMSE, plotting residuals, and calibration curves. However, this is an inference, and the actual postprocessing steps may vary depending on the specific requirements of the task.
