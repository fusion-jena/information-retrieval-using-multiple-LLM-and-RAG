Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository being available on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, it is stated that the entire geodatabase used in the tool can be downloaded as a map package for use on personal computers. This map package likely includes the data used in the study, which could potentially be used as input for a deep learning pipeline.

The map package is specifically mentioned to be useful for researchers and spatial analysts who may want to conduct in-depth studies or customize the data and visualizations for their specific needs. This suggests that the data is available in a format that allows for further analysis and modeling.

Moreover, the tool offers the addition of online data (feature 6 in Fig. 6), which might imply that there is potential for incorporating external data sources into the analysis. If a deep learning pipeline were to be implemented, it could potentially utilize this feature to access and incorporate relevant data.

In summary, while there is no direct mention of a data repository for a deep learning pipeline in the provided context, the map package containing the geodatabase can be downloaded for further analysis and customization. Additionally, the tool offers the possibility of incorporating external data sources, which could be used in a deep learning pipeline.
