The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does mention that deep learning algorithms were considered but not used due to the limited number of samples.

In the context, the authors have discussed various methods used to ensure the performance of other models, such as ensemble learning models. These methods include using the same dataset for all algorithms, establishing benchmark models, and hyperparameter optimization using random grid search and Bayesian optimization.

When it comes to ensuring the generalizability of a deep learning model, there are several strategies that can be employed. These include:

1. Diverse dataset: Gathering a diverse and representative dataset can help ensure that the model can generalize well to new, unseen data. This involves collecting data from various sources, locations, and conditions.

2. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance and generalizability of a model. It involves dividing the dataset into several folds, training the model on different subsets of the data, and evaluating its performance on the remaining portions. This process is repeated for each fold, providing a more reliable estimation of the model's performance.

3. Stratified splitting: Stratified sampling is a method used to ensure that the training and testing sets have a similar distribution of classes or labels. This can help prevent the model from being overfitted to one particular class or underfitting the minority classes.

4. Regularization techniques: Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping, can help prevent overfitting and improve the generalizability of deep learning models.

While the context does not explicitly mention these measures for deep learning models, it is possible that some or all of these strategies were employed for the other models discussed in the study. Nonetheless, without further information, it is not possible to definitively answer this question regarding deep learning models.
