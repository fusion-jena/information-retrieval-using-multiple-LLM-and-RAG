The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the methodology and results of a study that used active learning to develop a deep learning model for bird call recognition, specifically for the southern black-throated finch. It mentions various sources such as papers, proceedings, and a report, but none of them appear to contain the requested information. Therefore, I cannot provide a data repository link based on the given context.
