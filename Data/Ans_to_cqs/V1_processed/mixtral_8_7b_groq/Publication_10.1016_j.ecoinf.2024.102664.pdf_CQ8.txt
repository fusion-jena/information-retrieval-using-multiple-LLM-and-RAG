Based on the information provided, there is no mention of a code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study "Algal blooms forecasting with hybrid deep learning models from satellite data in the Zhoushan fishery." The context focuses on the performance and comparison of different deep learning models for algal bloom forecasting, but it does not include any details about the code repository or its location. It is possible that the code was not shared publicly, or it might be available through a different source not mentioned in the context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
