The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically a deep CNN setup as a wide residual network. This is evident from the description of the encoder and decoder architecture, which are both residual networks that use convolutions, batch normalization, and residual blocks. The encoder contains a pre-processing block with a convolution operation using a wide receptive field (5 × 5 kernel) and signal coarsening along the time axis. After convolution, feature representations are chunked along the time axis into independent frames, each of which is passed through a final linear layer to output the parameters for the Gaussian variational posterior. The decoder follows a symmetric structure, using upsampling blocks, residual blocks, and a final 1 × 1 convolution. Overall, the architecture is similar to BirdNet's encoder, with a pre-processing block and a wide residual network setup.
