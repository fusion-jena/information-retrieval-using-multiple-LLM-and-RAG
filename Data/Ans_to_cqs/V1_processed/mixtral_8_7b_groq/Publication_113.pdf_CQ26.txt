The provided context discusses various aspects of deep learning pipelines, including active learning strategies, dimensionality reduction, and model training. However, it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, I will provide a general overview of common techniques used to address data bias in deep learning.

Data bias is a common issue in machine learning, where the training data does not accurately represent the true distribution of the target population. This can lead to models that perform poorly or make inaccurate predictions on new, unseen data. To address data bias, several preprocessing techniques can be employed:

1. **Stratified splitting**: When splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets, it is important to ensure that each set maintains the same distribution as the original data. Stratified sampling ensures that each subset contains a representative proportion of samples from each class.

2. **Oversampling**: If the dataset is imbalanced, with one class having significantly more samples than another, oversampling can be used to increase the number of samples from the minority class. This can help the model learn more about the underrepresented class and improve its performance.

3. **Undersampling**: Alternatively, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of samples from the majority class, balancing the dataset. However, this technique may result in loss of valuable information.

4. **Diverse data collection**: To ensure that the data is representative of the target population, it is crucial to collect data from various sources, locations, and conditions. This helps to minimize bias and ensures that the model can generalize well to new, unseen data.

5. **Data augmentation**: Techniques such as rotation, scaling, and flipping can be used to artificially increase the size of the dataset, helping the model learn more about the data and its variations.

While the provided context does not discuss these techniques explicitly, they are essential preprocessing steps in addressing data bias in deep learning pipelines.
