Based on the information provided, the following data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline:

1. Photometric Distortions: This technique involves altering the brightness, contrast, and hue of the input images. Specifically, the 'hsv_h', 'hsv_s', and 'hsv_v' parameters in Table 2 control the hue, saturation, and value of the input images, respectively.
2. Translation: This technique involves shifting the input images horizontally and vertically. The 'translate' parameter in Table 2 controls the maximum amount of translation applied to the input images.
3. Scaling: This technique involves resizing the input images by a certain factor. Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, the 'mosaic' parameter in Table 2 could potentially involve scaling, as it involves randomly tiling multiple images into a single image.
4. Rotation: Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, the 'shear' parameter in Table 2 could potentially involve rotation, as it involves skewing the input images along a certain axis.
5. Flipping: This technique involves flipping the input images horizontally and vertically. The 'flipud' and 'fliplr' parameters in Table 2 control the flipping of the input images along the vertical and horizontal axes, respectively.
6. MixUp: This technique involves combining two input images and their corresponding labels to create a new input image and label. The 'mixup' parameter in Table 2 controls the degree of mixing applied to the input images.
7. Copy-Paste: This technique involves copying an object from one image and pasting it onto another image. Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, the 'copy_paste' parameter in Table 2 could potentially involve copy-pasting.

It's worth noting that not all of the aforementioned techniques were explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, based on the parameters listed in Table 2, it can be inferred that these techniques were likely used in the deep learning pipeline.
