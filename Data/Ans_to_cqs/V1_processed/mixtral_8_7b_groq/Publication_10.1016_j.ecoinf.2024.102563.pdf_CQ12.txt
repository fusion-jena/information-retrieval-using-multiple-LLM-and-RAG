Based on the provided context, there is no specific deep learning model mentioned as being used in the pipeline. Deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers are commonly used in remote sensing and geoscience applications. However, the text only mentions "deep learning" in the context of crop classification (Zhong et al., 2019). Therefore, without more information, it is not possible to determine the specific deep learning model used in the pipeline.
