The text provided does not explicitly mention the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was evaluated on three different datasets (UCCS, C-60, and U45), which can be seen as a form of external validation. This evaluation across multiple datasets suggests an attempt to assess the model's performance in different contexts and its ability to handle a variety of input data.

Moreover, the model was compared with other state-of-the-art methods using consistent testing and training processes, which also contributes to the assessment of its generalizability. The use of the same hardware environment for all methods and the same number of training epochs for their models helps reduce variability in the results due to different experimental conditions.

Lastly, the authors mentioned some limitations of their model, such as the fixed output image size and the model's performance in low-light deep water scenes and greenish color distortions. Acknowledging these limitations indicates a level of self-awareness regarding the model's generalizability and areas for potential improvement.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly state the measures taken to ensure generalizability, the evaluation across multiple datasets, consistent experimental conditions, and acknowledgment of limitations suggest an effort to assess and improve the model's ability to handle diverse input data.
