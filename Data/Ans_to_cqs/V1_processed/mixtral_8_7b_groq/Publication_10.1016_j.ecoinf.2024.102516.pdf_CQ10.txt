Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the methods and techniques used for plant species cover investigation, such as the use of ResNet50 and Feature Pyramid Networks. However, it does not give any details about where the code for this pipeline might be found, like a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
