The provided context does not include information about the specific deep learning model, its architecture, or its hyperparameters. Therefore, it is not possible to directly answer the query about the learning rate, optimizer, and other hyperparameters used in the model.

However, the context does provide information on the use of the Random Forest algorithm for land use and land cover (LULC) classification in the Amazon region. Random Forest is a machine learning algorithm, but not a deep learning one. Thus, the query seems to be about a deep learning model, not the Random Forest model.

In general, when working with deep learning models, hyperparameters are crucial for the model's performance. Some common hyperparameters for deep learning models include:

1. Learning rate: Controls the size of the steps in the gradient descent optimization process.
2. Optimizer: An algorithm used to update the model's weights based on the gradient of the loss function. Examples include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.
3. Number of layers and neurons: The architecture of the deep learning model, determining its depth and width.
4. Activation functions: Non-linear functions applied to the outputs of neurons, enabling the model to learn complex patterns.
5. Regularization techniques: Methods to prevent overfitting, such as L1 and L2 regularization or dropout.

When building a deep learning model for remote sensing or any other application, it is essential to tune these hyperparameters to achieve the best performance. Techniques for hyperparameter tuning include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.

In summary, although the provided context does not contain information on the hyperparameters of the deep learning model used in the study, I have provided a list of common hyperparameters for deep learning models. These hyperparameters are crucial for optimizing the model's performance in various applications, including remote sensing and LULC classification.
