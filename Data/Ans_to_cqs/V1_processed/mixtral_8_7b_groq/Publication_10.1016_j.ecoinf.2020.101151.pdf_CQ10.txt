I am unable to provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline for forest fire control as none was provided in the given context. The context includes information about vegetation and human impact related to forest fires, as well as references to scientific papers and a report about climate trends and their impact on biosphere and ecosystem services. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link.
