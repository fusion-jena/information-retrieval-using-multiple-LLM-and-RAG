Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the ecological source areas (ESA) and ecological corridors (EC) in the Wei River Basin (WRB) in China, and it does not mention any deep learning pipeline or data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
