The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

1. Number of iterations: 4000
2. Number of epochs: 200
3. Learning rate: 0.001
4. Batch size: 16
5. Subdivisions: 64

The model used in the study is YOLOv3, which has a new CNN feature extractor named Darknet-53. Darknet-53 is a 53-layered CNN that uses 3x3 and 1x1 convolutional layers. It has demonstrated advanced accuracy but with less floating-point tasks and better speed than ResNet-152. It also utilizes skip connections network inspired from ResNet.

The learning rate is set to 0.001, which is a common learning rate for deep learning models. The number of iterations is 4000, and the number of epochs is 200. An epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset, and an iteration is one update of the model's weights.

The batch size is 16, which means that 16 images are used to update the model's weights at a time. Subdivisions are used to further split the batch size for multi-GPU training.

These hyperparameters were chosen based on the performance of the model. The model's performance improved swiftly in terms of precision, recall, and mean average precision before plateauing after about 1000 iterations. The loss showed a rapid decline around 1000 iterations.

The model was trained for 14 hours, and the average loss was reduced to 0.54%, indicating that the model is affected by training data. However, when the number of epochs exceeds 200, the network seems to be overfitted to training data.

Therefore, these hyperparameters were used to train and validate the YOLO model for fish detection in hyperspectral images.
