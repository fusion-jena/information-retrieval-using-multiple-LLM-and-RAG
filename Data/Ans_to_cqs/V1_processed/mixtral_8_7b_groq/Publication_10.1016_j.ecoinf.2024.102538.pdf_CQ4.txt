Based on the provided context, the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for audio data are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that the audio preprocessing includes signal-noise separation, spectrogram transformation, and data augmentation.

In the context of audio data, common data augmentation techniques include:

1. Time Stretching/Compression: This technique changes the duration of the audio signal without altering its pitch. This can help the model to be more robust to variations in the speed of the audio.

2. Pitch Shifting: This technique changes the pitch of the audio signal without altering its duration. This can help the model to be more robust to variations in the pitch of the audio.

3. Adding Noise: This technique adds background noise to the audio signal. This can help the model to be more robust to noisy environments.

4. Data Cropping: This technique involves randomly selecting a segment of the audio signal and discarding the rest. This can help the model to focus on the important parts of the audio.

5. Time Shifting: This technique involves shifting the audio signal along the time axis. This can help the model to be more robust to slight variations in the start time of the audio.

6. Channel Permutation: This technique is specific to multi-channel audio signals. It involves randomly permuting the channels of the audio signal. This can help the model to be more robust to variations in the channel configuration.

In the given context, it is mentioned that the data augmentation techniques are used for the Acridotheres cristatellus sound. However, the specific techniques are not provided. Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to give a specific answer to the query.
