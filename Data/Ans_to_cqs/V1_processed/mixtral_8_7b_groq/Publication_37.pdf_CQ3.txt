The provided context discusses the use of deep learning for the automated classification of migrating birds' flight calls, but it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general practices in deep learning, particularly for object detection and image segmentation tasks, we can infer some possible data annotation techniques that could be used in similar pipelines.

In the context of computer vision, common data annotation techniques for deep learning include:

1. **Image-level labeling**: This is the simplest form of annotation where each image is assigned a single label representing the object class of interest. In the case of bird species classification, each audio recording would be labeled with the corresponding bird species.

2. **Bounding box annotation**: Here, a bounding box is drawn around each instance of the object of interest in an image. For bird species classification, this could involve drawing a bounding box around the bird in an image or video frame. However, for audio data like flight calls, this technique may not be directly applicable.

3. **Semantic segmentation**: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image to indicate the object class it belongs to. This can provide a more detailed representation of the objects in an image compared to image-level labeling or bounding box annotation.

4. **Instance segmentation**: This is a more advanced form of semantic segmentation where each instance of an object is segmented and distinguished from other instances of the same object class.

For the specific task of bird species classification from flight calls, data annotation techniques could include:

- **Audio-level labeling**: Each audio recording is labeled with the corresponding bird species.
- **Segment-level labeling**: If the audio recordings contain multiple flight calls, each segment of the audio corresponding to a single flight call could be labeled with the corresponding bird species.

It is important to note that the choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the desired level of detail in the model's output. In the context provided, the authors do not specify the data annotation technique used, so it is not possible to give a definitive answer based on the given information.
