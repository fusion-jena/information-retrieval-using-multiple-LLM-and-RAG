Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, the text does mention that Genetic Programming (GP) is used as an Input Variable Selection (IVS) technique to extract the inputs utilized in the optimal GP tree, which are then used as the optimal inputs for modeling with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN).

The ANN model described in the text consists of an output layer and two hidden layers, with three neurons assigned to the first hidden layer and five neurons to the second hidden layer. The model is implemented on the FORTRAN platform for its computational efficiency. However, the text does not provide any details about the postprocessing steps after the model training.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a specific answer regarding the postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
