The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it describes the use of an ensemble of machine learning (ML) models for predicting Short-billed Gull presence/absence. The specific ML algorithms used in the ensemble are not specified, but the context does mention the use of Salford Predictive Modeler (SPM) v8.3, which is a data mining and predictive analytics software that includes several ML algorithms.

The hyperparameters used in the ML models are not provided in the context. Hyperparameters are parameters that are set before the learning process begins and are not learned from the data. Examples of hyperparameters include the learning rate, the number of hidden layers in a neural network, and the regularization parameter.

In general, the choice of hyperparameters can have a significant impact on the performance of ML models. Grid search and random search are two common methods for tuning hyperparameters. Grid search involves specifying a range of possible values for each hyperparameter and training the model with all possible combinations of these values. Random search involves randomly selecting values for each hyperparameter from a specified range.

The context also mentions the use of an ensemble of ML models, which can improve the performance and robustness of predictions by combining the predictions of multiple models. Ensemble methods can reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of predictions.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model, it does describe the use of an ensemble of ML models for predicting Short-billed Gull presence/absence. The specific ML algorithms used in the ensemble and the hyperparameters of these models are not provided in the context.
