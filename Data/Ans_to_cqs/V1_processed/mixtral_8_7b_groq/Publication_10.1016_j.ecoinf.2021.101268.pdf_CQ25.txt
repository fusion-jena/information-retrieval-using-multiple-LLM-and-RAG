The deep learning model in the study is used for the classification of leaf images from ten different species found in the Peruvian Amazon Forest. The authors employ pre-trained models, specifically AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201, and fine-tune them to learn higher-level features specific to the leaf images. The fine-tuned models are then compared to determine which one performs best for the classification task.

The study uses a dataset collected from the Peruvian Amazon Forest, which includes 59,441 samples from ten endangered and profitable species. The dataset is acquired using six different commercial cameras to ensure variability and to develop a flexible solution for real-world conditions.

The authors use the pre-trained models to overcome the limitation of requiring a large amount of data for deep learning models to fit appropriately. The pre-trained models capture low-level features from the ImageNet dataset and transfer them to the leaf image dataset. The fine-tuning process involves adjusting the fully connected block to feed off the feature vector and output the ten species of leaves.

The authors evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned models both quantitatively and qualitatively. The qualitative analysis shows that AlexNet and VGG-19 learn high-level leaf features, such as venations and shapes, better than ResNet-101 and DenseNet-201. The models fine-tuned with the raw dataset fit better than the other models. However, the ResNet-101 model fine-tuned with pre-processed images learns to classify based on lateral sections, almost ignoring the leaf, indicating an error in the background removal algorithm of some images.

The authors conclude that AlexNet and VGG-19 are superior for the Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset since both derive high-quality abstractions. AlexNet achieves to extract shape, texture, and venation with some noise, while VGG-19 focuses strongly on shape and venation. Consequently, VGG-19 has remarkable results in different leaf image processing tasks.

Therefore, the deep learning model in this study is used for the classification of leaf images from the Peruvian Amazon Forest, and the authors find that AlexNet and VGG-19 perform better than ResNet-101 and DenseNet-201 for this task.
