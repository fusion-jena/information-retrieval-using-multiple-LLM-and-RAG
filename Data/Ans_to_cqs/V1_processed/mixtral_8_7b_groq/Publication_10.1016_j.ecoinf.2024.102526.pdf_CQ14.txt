Based on the provided context, there is not enough information to determine how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context describes the details of a data collection and imaging protocol for a study, including information about the type of quantification, planned spatial and temporal extents, image or frame interval, and camera specifications. However, it does not include any details about the modeling approach or hyperparameter optimization methods. Hyperparameter optimization methods such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization are typically described in the methodology section of a study or report, along with details about the model architecture and training procedure. Without this information, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer to the query.
