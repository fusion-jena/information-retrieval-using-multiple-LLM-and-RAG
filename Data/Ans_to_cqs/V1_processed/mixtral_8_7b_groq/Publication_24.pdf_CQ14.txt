The article by Fairbrass et al. (2019) does not provide explicit information on how the hyperparameters of their deep learning models for urban ecoacoustic assessment are optimized. However, they do mention using the "Keras Tuner" for hyperparameter optimization without specifying the specific method.

Hyperparameter optimization is crucial in deep learning model development, as it significantly impacts the model's performance. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search exhaustively evaluates a manually specified subset of hyperparameter values, while random search randomly samples the hyperparameter space. Bayesian optimization, on the other hand, uses probabilistic models to guide the search for optimal hyperparameters.

The Keras Tuner, developed by Google, is a hyperparameter optimization library for Keras models. It supports various optimization strategies, including random search, Bayesian optimization, and Hyperband. Hyperband is a bandit-based approach for hyperparameter optimization that balances exploration and exploitation by adaptively allocating resources.

Without further information from the article, it is unclear which specific hyperparameter optimization method was used. However, considering the use of the Keras Tuner, it is likely that either random search, Bayesian optimization, or Hyperband was employed for optimizing the deep learning models' hyperparameters.
