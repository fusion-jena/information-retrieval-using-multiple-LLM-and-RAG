The text provided does not give specific examples of techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some preprocessing techniques in general. For instance, it discusses the use of experimental data in the context of training a dynamic graph convolution neural network for air quality prediction (Dun et al., 2022). It also mentions the use of data collected over an extended period for predicting water quality parameters (Khullar and Singh, 2022; Prasad et al., 2021; Wai et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023).

In the context of addressing data bias, some common techniques used during data preprocessing include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain characteristics, such as class labels, and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to ensure that each subset of the data (e.g., training, validation, or testing) has a similar distribution of those characteristics. This can help to ensure that the model is trained on a representative sample of the data and is not biased towards certain classes or subgroups.

Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances of a particular class or subgroup in the data to balance out the distribution of classes or subgroups. This can be useful when there is a class imbalance in the data, where one class has many more instances than another class.

Undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of a particular class or subgroup in the data to balance out the distribution of classes or subgroups. This can be useful when there is a class imbalance in the data, where one class has many fewer instances than another class.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from a wide range of sources or under a variety of conditions to ensure that the data is representative of the population or phenomenon being studied. This can help to reduce bias in the data by ensuring that it is not skewed towards certain subgroups or conditions.

In summary, while the provided text does not give specific examples of techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, some common techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
