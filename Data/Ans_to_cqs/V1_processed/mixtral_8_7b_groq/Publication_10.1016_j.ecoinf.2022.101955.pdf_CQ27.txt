Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the deployment of a deep learning model. However, we do have details about the training of an artificial neural network (ANN) model, which is a type of deep learning model, using the "nnet" package in R.

The ANN model used in this study has a simple architecture with one hidden layer containing 6 neurons. The input layer size is equal to the number of used bands (6), and the output layer has 8 neurons, representing 8 land use/land cover (LULC) classes. The model was trained using a backpropagation learning algorithm. The primary model tuning parameters were size and decay, and the "control()" function was used to control model runs.

As for model deployment, the context does not provide specific details about model serialization or platform selection. Model serialization refers to the process of saving the trained model in a format that can be easily loaded and used for making predictions on new data. Common model serialization formats include JSON, XML, and binary formats specific to machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow's SavedModel format, PyTorch's torch.save()).

Platform selection refers to choosing the hardware and software environment where the model will be deployed. Common deployment platforms for deep learning models include local machines, virtual machines, containers, and cloud services.

Considering the tools and language used in this study (R and the "nnet" package), possible options for model serialization could be saving the trained model as an R object or using a package like "r2json" to save the model as a JSON file. For platform selection, the trained model could be deployed on a local machine, a virtual machine, or a cloud service supporting R, such as RStudio Workspace on AWS or Microsoft Azure's RStudio Connect.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information about model serialization and platform selection, we can infer possible approaches based on the tools and language used in the study. The trained ANN model could be serialized using R's built-in serialization or a package like "r2json" and deployed on a local machine, virtual machine, or cloud service supporting R.
