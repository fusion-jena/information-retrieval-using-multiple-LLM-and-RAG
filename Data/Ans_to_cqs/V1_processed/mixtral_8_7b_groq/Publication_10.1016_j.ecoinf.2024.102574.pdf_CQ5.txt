Based on the provided context, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are related to remote sensing, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) data, and geosciences. Specifically, the context does not mention any of the standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it refers to several specialized datasets related to geospatial data and analysis.

One such dataset is the LiDAR and UAV point clouds for Digital Terrain Model (DTM) creation and flood risk mapping, which is used in the study "Assessment of deep learning-based classification of LiDAR and UAV point clouds for DTM creation and flood risk mapping. Geosciences 9, 323."

Another dataset is the structure-from-motion photogrammetry data used in the study "Modeling the topography of shallow braided rivers using structure-from-motion photogrammetry. Geomorphology 213, 166–182." This dataset is derived from UAV imagery and used for topographic modeling.

The study "Effects of different vegetation restoration on soil water storage and water balance in the Chinese Loess Plateau. Agric. For. Meteorol. 206, 85–96" uses a dataset related to vegetation restoration and soil water storage in the Chinese Loess Plateau.

The carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems in China is studied in "The carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems in China. Nature 458, 1009–1013," which likely uses a dataset related to carbon sequestration and terrestrial ecosystems in China.

The study "Individual tree segmentation and tree species classification in subtropical broadleaf forests using UAV-based LiDAR, hyperspectral, and ultrahigh-resolution RGB data. Remote Sens. Environ. 280, 113143" uses UAV-based LiDAR, hyperspectral, and ultrahigh-resolution RGB data for individual tree segmentation and tree species classification in subtropical broadleaf forests.

The study "Neural network guided interpolation for mapping canopy height of China’s forests by integrating GEDI and ICESat-2 data. Remote Sens. Environ. 269, 112844" uses a dataset that integrates GEDI and ICESat-2 data for mapping canopy height of China’s forests.

The study "The potential and challenge of remote sensing-based biomass estimation. Int. J. Remote Sens. 27, 1297–1328" likely uses a dataset related to remote sensing-based biomass estimation.

The study "Machine learning techniques for tree species classification using co-registered LiDAR and hyperspectral data. Remote Sens. 11, 819" uses a dataset that includes co-registered LiDAR and hyperspectral data for tree species classification.

The study "UAV based estimation of forest leaf area index (LAI) through oblique photogrammetry. Remote Sens. 13, 803" uses a dataset obtained from UAV-based oblique photogrammetry for estimating forest leaf area index (LAI).

Therefore, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline in these studies are primarily related to remote sensing, LiDAR, UAV data, and geosciences.
