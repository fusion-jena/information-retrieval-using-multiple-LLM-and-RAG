The provided context does not directly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss various applications of machine learning and data visualization in soil science and environmental studies.

In the context of machine learning for classification purposes in digital soil mapping, techniques such as Random Forest, Cubist, and Support Vector Machine are mentioned (Geoderma 265, 62â€“77). These techniques are used to predict soil properties based on various input data. However, the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not discussed.

In the context of data visualization, techniques such as reinterpretation, analysis, mathematical modeling, and optimization are mentioned (Araya et al., 2018; Nguyen et al., 2022; Serrano-Notivoli et al., 2022). These techniques are used to transform data into a format that highlights the intended information. In the context of web-based visualization tools, Pi-VAT (Deval et al., 2022) and SMETool (Jarray et al., 2022) are mentioned. These tools use machine learning methods to visualize and estimate soil moisture data.

In the context of soil science and environmental studies, data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation may be used to train deep learning models for object detection and segmentation tasks. For example, in the context of remote sensing data for river analysis and mapping, techniques such as image segmentation and feature extraction may be used to annotate and analyze river features (Isikdogan, Bovik, Passalacqua, 2017).

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that techniques such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation are used in the context of object detection and segmentation tasks in soil science and environmental studies.
