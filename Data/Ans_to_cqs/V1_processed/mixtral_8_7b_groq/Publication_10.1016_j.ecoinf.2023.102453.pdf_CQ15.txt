The provided context discusses several optimization techniques used in deep learning models, but it does not explicitly mention the specific optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. However, it does mention Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and Hyperparameter optimization, which are techniques used to optimize the model's performance.

NAS is used for developing the EfficientNetV2B0 model, and it helps in optimizing parameter efficiency and training speed. Progressive learning is another technique used to improve the model performance by adapting regularization to the image size.

Hyperparameter optimization is another crucial optimization technique in deep learning. Hyperparameters are the parameters that define the model, such as learning rate, batch size, and dropout. Each hyperparameter has a range of values, and an optimum selection can improve the model performance. The context mentions that there are hundreds of hyperparameters that differ in their relative importance. Common hyperparameters for a DNN include learning rate, batch size, and dropout.

Transfer learning is another optimization technique mentioned in the context. It involves using pre-trained models to improve the performance of a new model. Transfer learning has three possibilities: feature extraction, fine-tuning with some layers trained, and fine-tuning with all layers trained. The context mentions that fine-tuning all layers trained results in an improvement in the classification performance. However, feature extraction preserves most of the pre-trained learning and can achieve high accuracy, especially for small datasets with reduced training time.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention SGD or Adam optimization algorithms, it does discuss several optimization techniques used in deep learning models. These techniques include Neural Architecture Search, Hyperparameter optimization, and Transfer learning. These techniques help optimize the model's performance by improving parameter efficiency, training speed, and selecting the optimum hyperparameters. Additionally, transfer learning can help improve the classification performance by using pre-trained models.
