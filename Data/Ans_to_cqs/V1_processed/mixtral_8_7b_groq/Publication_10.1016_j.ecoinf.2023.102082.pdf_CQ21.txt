Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training for the studies mentioned. However, I can provide some general postprocessing steps that are commonly used in machine learning models.

After training a machine learning model, some of the typical postprocessing steps include:

1. **Model evaluation metrics calculation:** This step involves calculating various evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the trained model. These metrics can include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC), among others. These metrics provide insights into how well the model is performing concerning the classification task.

2. **Confusion matrix:** A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model. It compares the predicted class labels with the actual class labels. The matrix shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, which can be used to calculate evaluation metrics.

3. **Saliency maps:** Saliency maps are a technique used to visualize the importance of input features for a given prediction. They highlight the regions of the input data that contribute the most to the model's prediction. Saliency maps can be useful for understanding the model's decision-making process and identifying potential biases or weaknesses in the model.

4. **Hyperparameter tuning:** Hyperparameter tuning involves adjusting the parameters of the model to optimize its performance. This step can be performed after evaluating the model's performance on a validation set. Grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization are some of the techniques used for hyperparameter tuning.

5. **Model interpretation:** Model interpretation involves analyzing the model's internal structure and weights to gain insights into the relationships between the input features and the output labels. Techniques such as feature importance, partial dependence plots, and SHAP values can be used for model interpretation.

Based on the context provided, it is likely that some of these postprocessing steps were performed in the studies mentioned. However, the specific steps are not explicitly stated.
