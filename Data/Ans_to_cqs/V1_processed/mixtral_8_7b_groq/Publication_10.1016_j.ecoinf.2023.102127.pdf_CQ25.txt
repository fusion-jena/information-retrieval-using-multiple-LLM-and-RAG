Based on the provided context, the text does not mention the use of deep learning models in the ibis.iSDM package. The package primarily focuses on supporting different engines for inferring or projecting the relative habitat suitability of biodiversity features. These engines use regression and non-parametric machine learning approaches, which are frequentist or Bayesian in nature. Examples of such engines include regularized elastic net regressions, Bayesian regularized "Spike-and-Slab" regressions, Bayesian additive regression trees, monotonic gradient descent boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the purpose of the deep learning model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection) as it is not mentioned or discussed in the text.
