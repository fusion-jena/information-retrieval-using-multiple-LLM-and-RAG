Deep learning models, including those used for image processing and analysis in the context of digitized herbarium sheets, employ various strategies to handle randomness in the pipeline. These strategies help ensure the reproducibility of results, improve model performance, and prevent overfitting.

One common method to manage randomness is the use of a random seed value. A seed value is an initial number that is used to generate a sequence of random numbers. By setting a specific seed value, researchers can ensure that the same sequence of random numbers is generated every time the model is trained or tested. This helps make the training process reproducible, as the same data splits, weight initializations, and other random events will occur in the same order.

In the context of the research article "Detection and annotation of plant organs from digitised herbarium scans using deep learning" (Younis et al., 2020), the authors used a specific random seed value to ensure reproducibility in their experiments. The paper does not explicitly mention the seed value used, but it is likely that they set a seed value for the deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow or PyTorch) and any libraries used for generating random numbers (e.g., NumPy).

Another strategy to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines is the use of data augmentation techniques. Data augmentation involves applying random transformations to the training data, such as rotation, scaling, flipping, or cropping. These transformations increase the diversity of the training data, reducing overfitting and improving the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. In the context of herbarium sheet image analysis, data augmentation techniques can help the deep learning model better handle variations in specimen orientation, lighting conditions, and image quality.

Lastly, deep learning models often employ techniques like dropout and batch normalization to manage randomness and improve model performance. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of neurons in a layer to zero during training, preventing over-reliance on specific neurons and reducing overfitting. Batch normalization, on the other hand, normalizes the inputs of each layer, reducing internal covariate shift and improving the model's convergence properties. Both techniques help handle randomness by introducing stochasticity during the training process.

In summary, deep learning pipelines employ strategies like setting a random seed value, data augmentation, dropout, and batch normalization to handle randomness. These methods help ensure reproducibility, improve model performance, and prevent overfitting. The research article by Younis et al. (2020) likely used a random seed value to ensure reproducibility in their experiments, but the specific seed value is not mentioned in the text.
