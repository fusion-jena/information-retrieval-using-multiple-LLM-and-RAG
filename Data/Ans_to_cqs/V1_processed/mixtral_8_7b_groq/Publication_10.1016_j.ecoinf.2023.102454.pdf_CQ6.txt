The text provided does not give specific details about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, in general, data preprocessing for deep learning models often includes steps such as data cleaning, normalization, and scaling.

Data cleaning involves handling missing or inconsistent data. This may include removing rows with missing values, imputing missing data, or correcting inconsistent data.

Normalization and scaling are techniques used to transform the data to a similar range or distribution, which can help improve the performance of the deep learning model. Normalization involves transforming the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Scaling involves transforming the data to a specific range, such as between 0 and 1.

Other preprocessing steps may include feature engineering, where new features are created from existing data, and data augmentation, where the dataset is artificially expanded by creating new samples from existing data.

It is important to note that the specific preprocessing steps required may depend on the characteristics of the data and the specific deep learning model being used. Therefore, it is often necessary to experiment with different preprocessing techniques to determine the best approach for a given problem.
