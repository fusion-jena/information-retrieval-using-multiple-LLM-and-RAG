The provided context does not give specific information on how the hyperparameters of the models used in the study were optimized. The study mentions using an ensemble modeling approach in the BIOMOD2 package in R, which includes regression-based and machine-learning models such as Generalized Linear Models (GLM), MaxEnt, Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). However, it does not specify the methods used to optimize the hyperparameters for these models. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves testing a predefined set of hyperparameter values, while random search randomly selects hyperparameter values to test. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic model to find the most promising hyperparameter values to test. Without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query.
