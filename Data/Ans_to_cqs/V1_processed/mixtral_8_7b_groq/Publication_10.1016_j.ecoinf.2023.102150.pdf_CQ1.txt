The methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines can vary depending on the specific application. In the context of ecological studies, there are several methods that have been used for collecting raw data.

One such method is the use of camera traps, which are sensors that capture images or videos of wildlife in their natural habitats. The camera traps consist of a Reconyx camera that is mounted on the ceiling of a metal box that can be entered by small mammals. These camera traps are protected with stones when placed in the field (Soininen et al., 2015; Kleiven et al., 2022). The images captured by these camera traps can then be used as input data for training deep learning models.

Another method for collecting raw data is through the use of large image data sets that are publicly available. To facilitate the use of machine learning in ecology, several neural networks trained on these large image data sets are now publicly available via simple user interfaces (Tabak et al., 2020). These data sets can be used as input data for training deep learning models.

Surveys are another method for collecting raw data. For example, Kavzoglu (2009) used refined training data from surveys to increase the accuracy of neural network classification. Similarly, Kellenberger et al. (2020) used interactive machine learning with image-based ecological surveys to accelerate the survey process.

Finally, public datasets can also be used as a source of raw data. For instance, the ImageNet database, which contains over 14 million images, has been used for training deep convolutional neural networks (Krizhevsky et al., 2012).

In summary, the methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines can include surveys, sensors such as camera traps, and public datasets. These data can then be used as input for training deep learning models.
