The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the use of remote sensing for the detection of invasive species, specifically Brazilian peppertree in the Everglades National Park, and the application of a multiple-instance learning algorithm for image classification. The data sources used in the study include NAIP, RapidEye, and Landsat 8 imagery. However, the specific repository where the data and code for the deep learning pipeline are stored is not mentioned. It is possible that the data and code are available upon request from the authors or through the journal's data repository. I would recommend contacting the authors or the journal for more information.
