The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of a ResNet152 network for image classification. ResNet152 is a variant of the Residual Network (ResNet) architecture, which is a type of CNN. Furthermore, the authors specifically refer to "convolutional layers" in the training process, which are characteristic of CNNs. Therefore, it can be concluded that a CNN is the type of deep learning model used in this pipeline.
