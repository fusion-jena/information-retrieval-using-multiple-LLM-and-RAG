In the context provided, there is no direct information about the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, I can provide some general information about common practices for data splitting in machine learning.

In machine learning, including deep learning, data splitting is a crucial step in model training and evaluation. The most common practice is to divide the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing.

1. Training set: This subset is used to train the model, enabling it to learn patterns from the data. The model's parameters are adjusted based on the performance on this set.

2. Validation set: Also known as the development set, this subset is used during the model-building process to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model. The validation set helps in tuning hyperparameters and making decisions about model selection and avoids overfitting on the training set.

3. Testing set: This subset is used to assess the final model's performance. It is the only dataset that remains unseen during the training and hyperparameter tuning process. The testing set provides an unbiased estimate of the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

The splitting criteria can vary depending on the problem, dataset size, and domain knowledge. Commonly, a ratio of 60-20-20 or 70-15-15 is used for training, validation, and testing, respectively. However, there are other strategies such as k-fold cross-validation, stratified sampling, and time-series splitting, which can be more appropriate depending on the specific use case.

In summary, while the provided context does not offer specific information on the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training, it is a common practice in machine learning to divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets to ensure model performance and generalizability.
