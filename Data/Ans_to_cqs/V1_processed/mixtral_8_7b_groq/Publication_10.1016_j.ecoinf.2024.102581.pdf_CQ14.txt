The text does not explicitly specify the method used for optimizing the hyperparameters of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. However, it does provide some insights that can help us infer a possible approach.

The described method involves exploring the search space of CNN hyperparameters, which includes the number of convolution layers, filters, filter size, number of neurons, batch size, epochs, and the CNN model optimizer. The search begins independently by all the populations simultaneously, and local minima are avoided by interacting the local best individual solutions with the global best solutions. This suggests a possible optimization strategy that is not explicitly mentioned in the text - a population-based optimization algorithm, such as a genetic algorithm or particle swarm optimization.

Moreover, the search process is categorized into two phases: global search or exploration and local search or exploitation. In the global search phase, the algorithm tries to explore different regions within a given search range, moving randomly to ensure thorough coverage of the search space. In the local search phase, the goal is to find promising solutions or a set of solutions from the area discovered during the first phase. This behavior aligns with the exploration-exploitation trade-off commonly found in population-based optimization algorithms.

The text also mentions that the hyperparameters with the current results are saved until better accuracy is achieved, and the algorithm terminates after a maximum number of iterations. This implies that the optimization process is iterative and keeps track of the best-found hyperparameters, which is consistent with the nature of population-based optimization algorithms.

In conclusion, while the text does not explicitly state the method used for optimizing the CNN hyperparameters, the described approach suggests a population-based optimization algorithm, such as a genetic algorithm or particle swarm optimization. The optimization process involves two phases: global search or exploration and local search or exploitation, and it is iterative, keeping track of the best-found hyperparameters until the algorithm terminates.
