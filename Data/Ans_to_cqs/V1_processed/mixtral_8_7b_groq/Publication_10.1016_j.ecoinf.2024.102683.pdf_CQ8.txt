I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the explanation and results of a study that implemented a Channel-wise Attention Module (CA) using four pooling operations to enhance the performance of a deep learning model for identifying medicinal plants from similar poisonous plants.

The authors presented the model's performance in different epochs and with varying training dataset percentages, but they did not mention the code repository's location. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information. I recommend contacting the authors or looking for the code repository on popular platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, using relevant keywords from the paper.
