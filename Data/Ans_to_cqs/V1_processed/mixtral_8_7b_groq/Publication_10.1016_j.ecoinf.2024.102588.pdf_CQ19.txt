The context provided does not give specific information about the deep learning frameworks used to build the models. The text mentions the use of a CNN model with an autoencoder and a conventional ANN model, but it does not specify the frameworks in which these models were implemented. It is possible that the models were built using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, but this information is not explicitly stated in the context.
