I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the YOLOv8 algorithm, its variations, and the performance evaluation of a specific ablated model. It discusses the trade-offs of adding a P2 feature level layer, the introduction of the C2f2 layer, and the evaluation metrics used for the model. However, it does not mention where the data repository is available for this deep learning pipeline.
