Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some implementation details that can indirectly contribute to the model's generalizability.

Firstly, the model was trained on large datasets, which can help improve the model's ability to generalize, as larger datasets can provide more diverse examples for the model to learn from.

Secondly, the learning rate was automatically reduced when the validation loss did not improve for 15 consecutive epochs. This technique, known as learning rate decay, can help the model avoid getting stuck in local minima and improve its ability to generalize.

Thirdly, weight decay was applied to control the strength of the unit Gaussian prior. Weight decay, also known as L2 regularization, can help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function that encourages the model to have smaller weights.

Finally, the model was trained for a long period of time, approximately 14 days, on a single Nvidia RTX2080Ti GPU. Training for a longer period of time can help the model converge to a better minimum and improve its ability to generalize.

However, it is important to note that these measures alone may not be sufficient to ensure the model's generalizability. Other techniques such as data augmentation, cross-validation, and stratified splitting could have been used in addition to these measures to further improve the model's ability to generalize. Therefore, while the provided context suggests some measures were taken to improve generalizability, it is unclear if sufficient measures were taken to ensure the model's generalizability.
