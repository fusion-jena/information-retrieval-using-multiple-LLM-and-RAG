The provided context discusses data analysis techniques in the field of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) and their application in studying the relationships between spatial structuration and the pelagic environment. However, it does not directly mention techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.

In general, techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain characteristics, then randomly splitting each subgroup to ensure a balanced representation in the training and testing sets.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances from the minority class to balance the data. This can be done by randomly duplicating instances or using more advanced techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances from the majority class to balance the data. This can be done randomly or by using more advanced techniques like NearMiss.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population. This can help reduce bias in the data and improve the performance of the deep learning model.

While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, they are commonly used in the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline to address data bias. It is important to note that the choice of technique depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the problem at hand.
