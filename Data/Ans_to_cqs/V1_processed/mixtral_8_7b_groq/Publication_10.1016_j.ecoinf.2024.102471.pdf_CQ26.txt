The provided context discusses the Wav2Vec model, a deep learning model used for automatic speech recognition, and a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture used for audio recording classification. However, it does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline.

Data bias can occur due to various reasons, such as unequal representation of classes, unrepresentative sampling, or missing data. To address these issues, several techniques can be employed during the preprocessing phase of the deep learning pipeline.

Stratified sampling is a technique used to ensure that the training and testing datasets are representative of the overall population. It involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria, such as class labels, and then randomly selecting samples from each subgroup to form the training and testing datasets.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance the class distribution in the dataset. Oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class to increase its representation in the dataset. Undersampling involves removing samples from the majority class to reduce its representation in the dataset.

Diverse data collection is a technique used to ensure that the dataset is representative of the overall population. It involves collecting data from various sources, such as different geographical locations, demographic groups, or time periods.

Other techniques include data augmentation, which involves creating new samples by applying transformations to the existing data, and feature engineering, which involves selecting and transforming features to improve model performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed, such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection, data augmentation, and feature engineering.
