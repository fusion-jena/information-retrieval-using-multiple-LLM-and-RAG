Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training in the PLUS model. The text focuses on describing the components of the PLUS model, which consists of the transformed specification mining framework based on the land expansion analysis strategy (LEAS) module and the cellular automata (CA) model based on a multi-type random patch seed mechanism (CARS). However, it does not mention any specific postprocessing steps such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating confusion matrices.

The LEAS module uses the random forest algorithm to obtain the development probabilities of each land use type based on two periods of land use data. This approach is considered superior to the FLUS model, which uses an artificial neural network (ANN) to determine development probabilities based on only one period of land use data. Additionally, the PLUS model proposes a decreasing threshold rule for generating patch seeds, which is achieved through an iterative process.

The CARS module simulates land use changes based on the patch-growth probabilities generated by the LEAS module. Cells with a higher total probability are more likely to change preferentially. The Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is then calculated using formulas (5) and (6), but the context does not provide details about these formulas.

In summary, while the provided context discusses the PLUS model's components and its functioning, it does not mention any specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating confusion matrices.
