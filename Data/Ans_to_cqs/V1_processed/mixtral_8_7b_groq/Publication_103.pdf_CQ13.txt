The context provided does not give specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the network is pre-trained on a big available dataset and then fine-tuned on the scarcer domain-specific data. It also mentions the use of a multinomial logistic regression on top of the SOFTMAX layer and the linear classification layer for training the network on dataset A.

Additionally, it mentions the use of Batch Normalization, which is a technique that standardizes and re-centers the inputs of each layer in the network, making the network more stable during training and reducing the need for careful initialization of the weights.

The context also mentions the use of a deep convolutional neural network architecture called "Inception" which is a type of architecture that uses multiple filters of different sizes on the same level, allowing the network to learn a wide range of features from the input data.

It is also worth noting that the context does not provide information about the specific optimization algorithm used, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSprop.
