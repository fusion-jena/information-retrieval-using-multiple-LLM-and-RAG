The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the metric of accuracy. The deep learning model in question is a Deep Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (DeepConvLSTM) architecture, which achieved the best validation accuracies in all the years tested (accuracy = 0.833 ± 0.005; mean of years ± sd). This model was compared with other candidate models, and it outperformed the rest, indicating its superior predictive performance.

Additionally, the predictive performance of the deep learning model was further evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric. The AUC is a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between different classes. In this case, the deep learning model was tested on six different classes representing various levels of egg number changes (Increase > 50%, Increase 25-50%, Increase 1-25%, No Change, Decrease 1-25%, Decrease 25-50%, Decrease >50%). The AUC values for each class were calculated, and the mean and standard deviation were reported for each test year. The AUC values ranged from 0.90 to 0.96, indicating excellent predictive performance.

It is worth noting that while the query asks about precision and recall, these metrics were not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, accuracy and AUC are commonly used metrics to evaluate the performance of machine learning models, including deep learning models. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions, while AUC measures the model's ability to distinguish between different classes. These metrics provide valuable insights into the model's performance and can help in selecting the best model for a given task.
