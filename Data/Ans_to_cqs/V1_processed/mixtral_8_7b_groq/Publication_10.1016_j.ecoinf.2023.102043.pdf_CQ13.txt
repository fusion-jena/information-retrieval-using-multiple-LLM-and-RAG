The provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model based on YAMNet for goat vocalization detection.

However, it does mention that the YAMNet model follows the MobileV1 convolution architecture and is pre-trained on data from 521 classes, including various sound events. The audio data is processed by converting it to a monophonic channel, resampling it at 16 kHz, extracting the spectrogram using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) magnitudes with 25 ms windows overlapped by 15 ms, and calculating the Mel spectrogram by mapping it to 64 bins of the Mel scale within the range of 125â€“7500 Hz. The embeddings are then extracted from the YAMNet model and fed as input to a sequential and reduce mean layer mapping to the classes.

Therefore, while the specific hyperparameters like learning rate and optimizer are not provided, the context gives insight into the pre-trained model used (YAMNet) and the audio data processing techniques employed.
