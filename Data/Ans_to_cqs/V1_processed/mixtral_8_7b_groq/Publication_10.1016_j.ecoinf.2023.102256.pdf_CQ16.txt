The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the bioacoustic models. Common methods to determine training completion include monitoring the validation loss and stopping the training when the loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model is overfitting to the training data. Another approach is to use early stopping, where training is halted if the validation loss does not improve for a certain number of epochs. Additionally, learning rate schedules can be employed to adjust the learning rate during training, allowing the model to converge to a better minimum. However, the specific criteria used for the bioacoustic models in the context are not mentioned. It is also worth noting that the models require retraining when new data or species are added, suggesting that the training process may be periodically reassessed and adjusted. Nonetheless, the exact criteria for training completion remain undisclosed in the given context.
