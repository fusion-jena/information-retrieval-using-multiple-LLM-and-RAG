Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository being available on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The context includes several papers that use various methods for analyzing different types of ecological data, such as LightGBM, a gradient boosting decision tree used for processing neural information (Ke et al., 2017), and data fusion algorithms for analyzing net primary productivity (Li, Zhao, Kang, & Ma, 2022). However, none of the papers mention a deep learning pipeline or its code repository.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
