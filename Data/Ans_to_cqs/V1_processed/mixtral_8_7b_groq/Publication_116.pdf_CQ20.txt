The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of a deep learning framework called Caffe, which can be used to run deep learning models on various hardware platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs).

In the study described in the context, the authors used a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model called GoogLeNet, which was developed by Google and trained using their TensorFlow framework. TensorFlow supports a wide range of hardware platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the authors of the study used either GPUs or TPUs to train their deep learning model. However, the context does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion about the specific hardware resources used.
