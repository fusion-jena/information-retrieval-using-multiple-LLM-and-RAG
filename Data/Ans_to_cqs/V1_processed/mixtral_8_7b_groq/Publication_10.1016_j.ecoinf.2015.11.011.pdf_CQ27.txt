Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, including steps such as model serialization or platform selection. However, the text does provide some context about the use of machine learning techniques, including potentially deep learning, in the classification of imagery using eCognition software.

The text mentions that segmentation and classification strategies in eCognition are rapidly evolving, with machine learning techniques being brought together with segmentation to more automatically classify images. It is also noted that even with machine learning, some supervision and validation using aerial photo interpretation techniques or other data sources are still necessary. This suggests that the process of deploying a deep learning model in this context would likely involve training the model on a suitable dataset, validating and verifying the model's performance using additional data, and then integrating the model into the eCognition software for use in image classification.

However, the specifics of how the trained model would be integrated into the software, such as through model serialization or platform selection, are not provided in the text. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this part of the query without additional information.
