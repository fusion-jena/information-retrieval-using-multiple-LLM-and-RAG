Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix after the model training. However, it is mentioned that measuring the accuracy of different CNNs and the effect of different confidence thresholds took several hours. This process might involve calculating metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

Additionally, the discussion on model parameters indicates that the model was trained up to 6000 iterations, and manual annotations were used to generate training, validation, and testing datasets. This suggests that some form of evaluation, such as generating a confusion matrix, might have been performed to assess the model's performance.

However, the context does not provide enough information to give a definitive answer on the postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
