The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Normalized Square Error (NSE), Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), and Bias. 

MAE is a measure of the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values.

NSE is a measure of the proportion of the variance in the predictions that is explained by the model. It is calculated as the ratio of the sum of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values to the variance of the actual values.

RMSE is a measure of the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, taking into account both the direction and magnitude of the errors. It is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values, divided by the number of predictions.

Bias is a measure of the systematic error or deviation of the predictions from the actual values. It is calculated as the average of the differences between the predicted and actual values.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in predicting the water flow in a river. The model is a DA-RNN (Dual-stage Attention Recurrent Neural Network) which is trained using a custom HyperBand algorithm to optimize the network architecture and hyperparameters. The model is trained and tested using the same data and conditions as the HRHN (Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network) model. The results obtained with both models are presented in the study.
