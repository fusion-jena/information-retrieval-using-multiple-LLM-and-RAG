The provided context discusses various standards and formats for environmental data, but it does not directly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, deep learning pipelines can utilize a variety of data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files.

1. Image files: Image data is often used in deep learning tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Common image file formats include JPEG, PNG, and TIFF.
2. Audio files: For audio-related deep learning tasks, such as speech recognition or music analysis, audio file formats like WAV, MP3, and FLAC are frequently used.
3. Video files: Video data can be used in deep learning applications like action recognition, object tracking, and video summarization. Common video file formats are MP4, AVI, and MOV.
4. CSV files: CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are simple text files that store tabular data, with values separated by commas. They are commonly used for structured data, such as numerical or categorical data, in deep learning applications like regression, time series analysis, and natural language processing.

In summary, deep learning pipelines can work with various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files. The provided context focuses on environmental data standards and formats and does not explicitly mention these formats.
