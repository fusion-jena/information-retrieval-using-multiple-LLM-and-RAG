Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it is mentioned that machine learning methods, including an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were used to model net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. The trained ANN was a multilayer perceptron with a hidden layer, and the number of neurons in this layer was determined by the Fletcher-Gloss method. The context also mentions that the number of random regression trees (ntree), the number of division variables (mtry), and the minimum size of nodes (node size) were configured during RF training.

While these details provide insight into the model training process, they do not specify any postprocessing steps. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer regarding the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix.
