The provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of datasets in the context of deep learning for ecological applications.

For instance, the Microsoft COCO dataset is mentioned in the context of computer vision, which is a common source of raw data for deep learning models. This dataset contains common objects in context and is often used for object detection and segmentation tasks.

In addition, the SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) is mentioned, which is a method for object detection that uses a single shot detector. This method typically requires a dataset of images with annotated objects for training.

Furthermore, the YOLOv5 deep residual convolutional neural network is mentioned in the context of ecological applications. This model is likely trained on a dataset of images with annotated objects, although the specific dataset is not mentioned.

In the context of ecological applications, raw data is often collected through surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Surveys can include manual counts of species or other ecological features, while sensors can include devices that measure environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, and light levels. Public datasets can include data collected by government agencies, non-profit organizations, or other groups that make their data available for research purposes.

Overall, while the provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that a combination of surveys, sensors, and public datasets are used to collect raw data for ecological applications of deep learning.
