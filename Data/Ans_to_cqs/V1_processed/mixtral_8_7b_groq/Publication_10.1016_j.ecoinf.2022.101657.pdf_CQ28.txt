The provided pieces of context do not specify which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. There are mentions of various hardware and software used in the process of developing and implementing the model, but none of them clearly indicate the use of a specific cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

For instance, the context discusses the use of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for reducing power consumption and improving performance of neural networks. However, it does not mention if these FPGAs are part of a cloud platform or are used locally.

Furthermore, there is a reference to a study that uses a Raspberry Pi for broad-scale applications in biology, but this does not necessarily imply the use of a cloud platform either.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
