I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used to create the Lang10m and Potapov30m high-resolution CHMs of the Earth. The context includes details about the datasets used, the spatial resolution and validity years of the CHMs, and the methods used for data processing and validation. However, there is no mention of where the code repository can be found. It is possible that the authors have not made it publicly available, or it may be hosted on a different platform. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested information.
