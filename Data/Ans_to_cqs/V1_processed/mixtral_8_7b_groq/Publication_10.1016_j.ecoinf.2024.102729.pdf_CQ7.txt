In the context provided, there is no specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, there is some information about the data splitting process for a Random Forest (RF) model.

In RF modeling, the dataset is randomly divided into two subsets. The first subset is used as a training dataset to learn the optimal model structure, and the second subset is used as a validation dataset to test the model's performance. Seventy-five percent of the data is devoted to model training, and 25% is used for testing. Additionally, the data splitting process maintains the covariance structure among the predictor variables relatively intact between the training and testing datasets.

However, this process is specific to RF modeling and not necessarily applicable to deep learning models. In deep learning, data splitting criteria can vary depending on the problem and the specific deep learning algorithm used. Commonly, the data is split into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

The criteria used to split the data can include random sampling, stratified sampling, or cluster sampling. Random sampling involves selecting data points randomly from the dataset. Stratified sampling involves dividing the dataset into strata based on certain criteria, such as class labels, and then selecting a random sample from each stratum. Cluster sampling involves dividing the dataset into clusters based on certain criteria and then selecting a random sample from each cluster.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it is common to split the data into training, validation, and testing sets in deep learning. The criteria used to split the data can vary depending on the problem and the specific deep learning algorithm used.
