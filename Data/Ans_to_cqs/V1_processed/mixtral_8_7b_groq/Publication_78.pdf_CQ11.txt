The provided context does not include information about a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. There are several studies and figures cited in the context, but none of them explicitly mention or provide a link to a data repository for a deep learning pipeline. The context mainly discusses different studies related to big data, cognitive computing, chronic disease prediction, image captioning, intrusion detection, medical image classification, sports image classification, drone image processing for coral reefs, and neural network recognition of marine benthos and corals. However, it does not include any information about a data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
