In the context provided, the training of a model is considered complete when a satisfactory performance is achieved on the validation dataset. The validation dataset is an independent set of samples used to compute the accuracy and loss (estimation of the error) of the model. It is not used during the training process, and therefore, it can indicate if the model is overfitting the training data and not learning features that are key for recognizing the individuals.

To determine when the training is complete, the model is initially trained for a fixed number of epochs (i.e., passing the entire dataset through the neural network ten times) with a small number of manually labeled pictures. If the model performs poorly, additional pictures are manually labeled and added to the training dataset. This process is repeated until a satisfactory performance is achieved.

For the great tits, a minimum of 500 pictures in the training data and 125 for validation was needed to obtain high performance for individual recognition. As a compromise between the number of birds that they could include in their study and the number of images per bird, they aimed to use 1,000 images per birdâ€”900 images for the training dataset and 100 images for the validation dataset.

Therefore, in this context, the training is considered complete when the model achieves a satisfactory performance on the validation dataset, and it is difficult to anticipate the minimum number of images needed from each individual to obtain high performance for individual recognition.
