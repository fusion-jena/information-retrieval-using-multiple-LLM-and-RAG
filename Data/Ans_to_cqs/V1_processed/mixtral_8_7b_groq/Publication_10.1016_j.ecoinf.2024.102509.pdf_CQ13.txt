Based on the provided context, the hyperparameters of the deep learning model, specifically the Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) model, are not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer some details about the model's architecture and training process that can help us identify potential hyperparameters.

1. Number of hidden layers and neurons: The BP-ANN model consists of an input layer with n covariates, two hidden layers with p hidden neurons, and one output layer with one output neuron. The selection of hidden layers and neurons was determined through trial and error, suggesting that the learning rate might have been adjusted during this process.

2. Training algorithm: The 'neuralnet' package of R 4.1.2 software was used for training the model, but the specific training algorithm or optimizer is not specified. Common optimizers for ANN models include Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam).

3. Loss function: The loss function, also known as the objective function or cost function, is crucial for training ANN models. The context mentions the use of a loss function for the BP-ANN model, but the specific type is not provided. Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a common loss function for regression problems, and it is used in the context as one of the evaluation metrics.

4. Regularization: Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, are used to prevent overfitting in ANN models. Although the context does not explicitly mention regularization, it provides Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) values, which can be used to compare models and account for overfitting.

5. Learning rate: The learning rate determines the size of the steps taken during gradient descent optimization. The context does not explicitly mention the learning rate, but it is an essential hyperparameter for ANN models. A learning rate that is too high may cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, while a learning rate that is too low may result in slow convergence.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly provide information on hyperparameters like the learning rate or optimizer, it allows us to infer that the BP-ANN model uses a loss function, possibly MSE, and might have used a learning rate adjustment during the trial-and-error process of selecting hidden layers and neurons. Regularization techniques and a specific optimizer are not explicitly mentioned but could have been employed during model development.
