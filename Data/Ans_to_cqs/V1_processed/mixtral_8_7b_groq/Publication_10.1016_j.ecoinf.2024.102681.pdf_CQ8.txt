Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study "From meteorological to agricultural drought: Propagation time and influencing factors over diverse underlying surfaces based on CNN-LSTM model" by Junchen Long et al. The context includes several papers that cite or are cited by the study, but none of them mention the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the code repository. It is possible that the authors have not made it publicly available, or it may be hosted on a platform that is not mentioned in the context. If you are interested in the code, I would recommend contacting the authors directly to inquire about its availability.
