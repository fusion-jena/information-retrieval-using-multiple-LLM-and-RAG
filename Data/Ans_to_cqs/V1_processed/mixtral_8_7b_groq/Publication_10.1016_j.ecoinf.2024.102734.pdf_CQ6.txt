The provided context discusses the training of deep learning models for classifying vocalizations, but it does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention that the data is downsampled to 16 kHz, which can be considered a form of preprocessing.

In the context of audio data, preprocessing steps often include:

1. **Downsampling:** This involves reducing the sampling rate of the audio signal. In this case, the data is downsampled to 16 kHz. This step can be useful for reducing computational requirements and making the data more manageable.
2. **Feature extraction:** This involves converting the raw audio data into a more suitable format for the model. In this case, the authors use mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) which can be represented as a single-channel images.
3. **Normalization:** This involves scaling the data to a similar range to improve model training. The context does not explicitly mention normalization, but it is a common preprocessing step for deep learning models.
4. **Cleaning:** This involves removing unwanted noise or artifacts from the data. The context mentions that each segment has been manually reviewed by a human, which suggests that some form of cleaning or quality control has been performed.

It's important to note that the specific preprocessing steps can vary depending on the nature of the data and the requirements of the model. Therefore, it's always a good practice to experiment with different preprocessing techniques to find the best approach for a particular problem.
