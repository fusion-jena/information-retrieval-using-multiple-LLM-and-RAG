I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of HRNet model for semantic segmentation of social media image data, and deriving indices such as greenness, blueness, and sky openness. However, it does not mention where the code for this pipeline is available, be it on GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other platform. I hope this information helps, and I apologize for any inconvenience.
