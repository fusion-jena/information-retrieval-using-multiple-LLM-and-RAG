The provided context discusses the use of machine learning (ML) models in the process of labeling images from remote cameras used for wildlife monitoring. However, it does not go into detail about the specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting.

In general, overfitting is a common problem in machine learning where a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the hidden units in a layer to zero during training. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single unit and encourages the model to learn more robust features. Dropout has been shown to be an effective regularization method for deep neural networks, improving their performance on various tasks.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which in turn leads to simpler models that are less prone to overfitting. L2 regularization is widely used in deep learning and has been shown to improve the generalization performance of deep neural networks.

In summary, dropout and L2 regularization are two common regularization methods used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. However, the provided context does not mention any specific regularization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the ML model used in the image labeling process.
