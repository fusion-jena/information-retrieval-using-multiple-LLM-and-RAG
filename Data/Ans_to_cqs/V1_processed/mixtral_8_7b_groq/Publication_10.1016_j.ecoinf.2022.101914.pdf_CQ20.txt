Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The text only mentions the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as one of the machine learning approaches, but it does not specify if GPUs, TPUs, or any other hardware accelerators were used during the training process.

However, it is important to note that training deep learning models typically requires a significant amount of computational power, and using hardware accelerators like GPUs or TPUs can greatly speed up the training process. In many deep learning frameworks, it is possible to specify the use of these hardware resources during model training.

In the context of the given text, the authors focus on comparing different modeling approaches for ecological problems and do not go into detail about the hardware resources used for training. They do mention the use of the biomod2 package in R for building the models, but this package does not specify the use of any particular hardware accelerators for deep learning models.

In summary, while the provided context does not give information on the hardware resources used for training deep learning models, it is common practice to use hardware accelerators like GPUs or TPUs for training deep learning models to reduce training time.
