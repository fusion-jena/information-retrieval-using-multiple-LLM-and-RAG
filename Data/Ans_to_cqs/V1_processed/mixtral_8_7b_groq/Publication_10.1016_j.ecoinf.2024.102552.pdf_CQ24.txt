The provided context does not directly discuss the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of machine learning methods for classification, including "human in the loop" classification. This method could potentially help reduce the impact of randomness by incorporating human expertise and pattern recognition into the classification process.

Additionally, the context mentions the importance of input quality for machine learning methods, including the use of NAIP imagery and training datasets. Ensuring high-quality inputs can help reduce the impact of randomness on the classification process.

The context also discusses the use of uncertainty quantification and propagation in the analysis process. While this is not specifically related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does demonstrate an awareness of the importance of accounting for uncertainty and variability in the analysis process.

Finally, the context mentions the potential for future work to improve the accuracy of the analysis and the propagation of uncertainty. This suggests an ongoing effort to refine and improve the analysis process, which could potentially include strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention related concepts such as input quality, uncertainty quantification, and ongoing improvement efforts. These concepts suggest a general awareness of the importance of accounting for variability and uncertainty in the analysis process.
