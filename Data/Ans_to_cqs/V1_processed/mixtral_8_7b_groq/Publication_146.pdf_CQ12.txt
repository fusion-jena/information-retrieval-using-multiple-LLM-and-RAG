The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the YoloV3 architecture. This information is derived from the context provided in the last piece of text, which mentions "aerial images processing for car detection using convolutional neural networks: Comparison between faster r-cnn and yolov3" (arXiv 2019, arXiv:1910.07234). Additionally, the authors state that they used the YoloV3 model for their project. CNNs are a popular choice for computer vision tasks such as object detection and image processing due to their ability to effectively analyze spatial data.
