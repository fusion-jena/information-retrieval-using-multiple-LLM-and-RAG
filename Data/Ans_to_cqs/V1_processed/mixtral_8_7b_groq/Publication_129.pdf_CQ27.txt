The text provided describes a study that developed a new mobile application for recognizing agricultural pests using deep learning in a cloud computing system. However, it does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.

Based on the general process of developing deep learning models, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized to make it easier to transport and deploy. Model serialization involves converting the model into a format that can be stored and loaded again, such as a JSON file or a binary format. This allows the model to be easily deployed on different platforms without requiring the original code or environment used for training.

As for the platform selection, the text mentions that the detection and classification procedures of agricultural insect pests can be executed in a few seconds in the cloud computing system. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was deployed on a cloud computing platform. Cloud computing platforms offer several advantages for deploying deep learning models, such as scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness.

However, without more information, it is difficult to provide a more specific answer to the query. It would be helpful to have more details about the deployment process, such as the specific cloud computing platform used, the tools and libraries used for model serialization and deployment, and any testing or validation performed after deployment.
