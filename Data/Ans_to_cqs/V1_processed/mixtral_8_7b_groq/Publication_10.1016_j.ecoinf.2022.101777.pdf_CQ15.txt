The provided context does not mention any deep learning optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. The described pipeline involves image classification using a Random Forest (RF) model, which is a type of machine learning algorithm but not deep learning.

Deep learning optimization techniques are used to update the weights and biases in the model during training to minimize the loss function. Some common optimization techniques include:

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): This is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the weights and biases in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function.
2. Momentum: This is an optimization technique that adds a fraction of the previous weight update to the current weight update, which can help the model converge faster.
3. Adagrad: This is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradient information.
4. Adadelta: This is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate based on the historical gradient information, similar to Adagrad, but uses a running average of the historical gradient information instead of the sum.
5. Adam: This is an optimization algorithm that combines the ideas from momentum and Adagrad to adapt the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradient information.

Since the provided context does not mention any deep learning optimization techniques, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
