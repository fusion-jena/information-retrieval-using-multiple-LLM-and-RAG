The provided context does not give detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of a student SDM (Species Distribution Model) trained using a final training set consisting of labeled and pseudo-labeled data. This implies that the deep learning model is part of a larger system that includes an ensemble-based teacher model and a process for generating pseudo-labels.

The teacher model is established using various conventional SDMs, including ANN (Artificial Neural Network), RF (Random Forest), GBM (Gradient Boosting Machine), XGB (Extreme Gradient Boosting), and LGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine). The teacher model is then used to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, which are added to the training set based on their habitat suitability. The teacher model is retrained using the expanded training set, and this process is repeated incrementally.

The final training set, which includes both labeled and pseudo-labeled data, is used to train the student SDM. However, the context does not provide information on how the trained deep learning model is serialized or deployed on a platform.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is:

 The provided context does not give detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It only mentions the use of a student SDM trained using a final training set consisting of labeled and pseudo-labeled data. The process of generating pseudo-labels and retraining the teacher model is described, but there is no information on model serialization or platform selection.
