The provided context does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning framework was used to build the described convolutional neural network (CNN) model. However, it is mentioned that ReLU activation was used for the convolutional layers and an exponential linear unit (ELU) activation was used on the fully connected layer. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch, two popular deep learning frameworks, support these activation functions.

TensorFlow, developed by Google Brain, is a widely-used open-source library for machine learning and deep learning. It provides robust support for a variety of neural network layers, activations, and optimization algorithms, and has a large community of users. TensorFlow also has a built-in support for GPU acceleration, which can significantly speed up the training process.

PyTorch, developed by Facebook's AI Research lab, is another popular open-source deep learning framework. It is known for its simplicity and ease of use, and has a dynamic computation graph, which allows for greater flexibility during model building and training. PyTorch also has a strong ecosystem of libraries and tools, and provides GPU acceleration.

Given the popularity and extensive support for various deep learning components in both TensorFlow and PyTorch, it is likely that either of these frameworks could have been used to build the described CNN model. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to definitively determine which framework was used.
