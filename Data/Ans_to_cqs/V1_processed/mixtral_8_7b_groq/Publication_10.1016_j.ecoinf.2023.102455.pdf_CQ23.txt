Based on the provided context, there are several measures that were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models, even though the specific terms "diverse dataset," "cross-validation," and "stratified splitting" are not explicitly mentioned.

Firstly, the authors used a combination of different models, including CNN-BiGRU, RVFL, KELM, CNN-BiRNN, and Phase, to ensure that the final model is not overfitting to a specific type of model. This is a form of ensemble learning, which can improve the generalizability of the model by combining the predictions of multiple models.

Secondly, the authors used a normalization technique to preprocess the input data. Specifically, they normalized the inputs and target parameters between 0 and 1 using the formula Xnorm = (X - Xmin) / (Xmax - Xmin). This ensures that all inputs are on a similar scale, which can improve the generalizability of the model by reducing the impact of outliers or large values in the input data.

Thirdly, the authors used regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. Specifically, they used a regularization coefficient and a kernel parameter to control the complexity of the models. This can help to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which encourages the model to have simpler weights and biases.

Finally, the authors used different combinations of hyperparameters for each model, such as the number of layers, neurons, filters, kernel size, learning rate, and optimization algorithm. This allows the models to be trained and tested with different configurations, which can help to ensure that the final model is not overfitting to a specific set of hyperparameters.

In summary, while the specific terms "diverse dataset," "cross-validation," and "stratified splitting" are not mentioned in the provided context, the authors took several measures to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models. These measures include ensemble learning, normalization, regularization, and hyperparameter tuning.
