While the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of variational autoencoders (VAEs), which can employ a technique called β-annealing to help manage randomness.

Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are probabilistic graphical models that combine an encoder and a decoder to learn latent representations of input data. During training, VAEs optimize a objective function that consists of a reconstruction loss and a regularization loss. The reconstruction loss measures how well the decoder can recreate the input data from the latent representation, while the regularization loss encourages the encoder to produce latent representations that follow a specified prior distribution, often a standard normal distribution.

β-annealing is a strategy used during VAE training to control the balance between the reconstruction loss and the regularization loss. By gradually increasing the weight of the regularization loss (denoted by β) over the course of training, β-annealing allows the model to first focus on learning to reconstruct the input data, and then gradually shift its focus to learning a smooth and structured latent space. This can help manage randomness in the training process by providing a more stable optimization landscape.

In addition to β-annealing, there are other strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. For example, setting a fixed random seed value at the beginning of training can ensure that the same sequence of random numbers is used throughout the training process, making the training process reproducible. Additionally, techniques such as dropout and batch normalization can help reduce the impact of randomness by introducing regularization and normalization, respectively.

Overall, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of VAEs and β-annealing, which can be helpful in managing randomness during training. Other strategies for handling randomness include setting a fixed random seed value, dropout, and batch normalization.
