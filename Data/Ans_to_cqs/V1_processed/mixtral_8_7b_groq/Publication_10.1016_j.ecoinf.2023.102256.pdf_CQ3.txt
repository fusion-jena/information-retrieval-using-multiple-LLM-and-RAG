The provided context discusses a deep learning pipeline for species classification using spectrogram inputs. However, it does not explicitly mention any data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. These techniques are typically used in object detection and segmentation tasks in computer vision, which may not be directly applicable to the species classification task using spectrograms.

In the described pipeline, the baseline model is a simple CNN architecture that takes a spectrogram input and outputs a probability for each of the 22 species. The authors also explore a multi-branch CNN approach to incorporate additional information into the network while maintaining model simplicity.

However, the context does mention the use of one-hot encoding and geographical priors as methods to incorporate contextual information into the deep learning classifier. One-hot encoding is a technique for representing categorical data as a binary vector, where each element of the vector corresponds to a category and is either 0 or 1. Geographical priors, on the other hand, are a way of incorporating geographical information into the model by using a separate branch for the geographical information.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention any data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, it does discuss the use of one-hot encoding and geographical priors as methods for incorporating contextual information into the deep learning classifier.
