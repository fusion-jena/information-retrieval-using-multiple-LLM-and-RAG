The provided context discusses the use of pre-trained language models, such as BERT, for text classification tasks and mentions some preprocessing steps, but it does not give a comprehensive list of all possible preprocessing steps that could be involved before training a deep learning model. However, I can provide a general answer based on common practices in the field of machine learning and deep learning.

When preparing data for training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are often involved, including:

1. **Data cleaning**: This step involves handling missing or corrupted data points, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistent data. For text data, this might include removing stop words, punctuation, or special characters, and correcting spelling or grammar errors.

2. **Normalization**: This step aims to make sure that all features have similar scales, which can help the model converge faster and perform better. For numerical data, this might involve scaling or standardizing the data. For text data, this could involve techniques like tokenization, stemming, or lemmatization.

3. **Encoding**: Deep learning models typically require numerical input, so categorical data needs to be encoded. For text data, this could involve one-hot encoding, binary encoding, or embedding techniques.

4. **Feature extraction**: This step involves deriving meaningful features from the data. For text data, this could involve techniques like bag-of-words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings.

In the context of the provided text, the preprocessing steps mentioned are tokenization and chunking. Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into individual words or tokens, which is necessary for input into a model like BERT. Chunking is a form of text segmentation, where the text is divided into smaller parts or chunks, which can be useful for handling long texts or for identifying relevant sections of text.

In the specific case of using BERT for text classification, the text is tokenized using the BERT tokenizer after being chunked into sections of 300 tokens. If the text is a social media post, the maximum number of tokens is set to 400, and if it is a web article, the maximum number of tokens is set to 512. This is done to fit the input size limit of BERT, which can only accept a maximum of 512 tokens as input.
