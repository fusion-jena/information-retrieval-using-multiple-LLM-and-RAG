The text provided does not give information about the datasets used in deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. It mainly focuses on the application of machine learning in the context of marine ecology and fisheries, particularly in the sustainable management of the Indian Ocean tuna purse seine fishery.

The article "Machine-learning aiding sustainable Indian Ocean tuna purse seine fishery" uses various datasets related to marine environmental factors. These include:

1. Current speed
2. Temperature
3. Sea level anomaly
4. Mixed layer depth
5. Bottom temperature
6. Sea Surface Temperature (SST)
7. Net primary production
8. Dissolved molecular oxygen concentration
9. Chlorophyll concentration
10. Chlorophyll fronts
11. SST fronts
12. Thermocline intensity
13. Thermocline depth
14. Temperature gradient
15. Bathymetry
16. Latitude
17. Longitude
18. Month

These datasets are used to analyze and predict the distribution and behavior of tropical tuna, aiming to support sustainable fishing practices. However, these are not standard datasets used in general deep learning applications like image recognition or natural language processing.

Therefore, the answer to the query is not mentioned in the provided context.
