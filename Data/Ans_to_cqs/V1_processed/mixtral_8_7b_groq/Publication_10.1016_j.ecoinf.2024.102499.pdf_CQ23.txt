The researchers took several measures to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. To prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to perform well on unseen data, they used a diverse dataset and performed 5-fold cross-validation.

The dataset consisted of video clips of 27 different shark species, including the three species of interest: C. amblyrhynchos, T. obesus, and C. melanopterus. Using a diverse dataset with multiple species helped the model learn a wider range of features and patterns, which improved its ability to generalize to new, unseen species.

Cross-validation was performed to further assess the robustness of the method. For each fold, the researchers randomly selected 80% of the dataset (videoclips) to train the model and 20% to test it. This approach ensured full independence between images of the training set and testing set, as images from the same videos were very alike and could lead to a model with a low generalization capacity.

The researchers also mentioned that they could not split directly images from the frame dataset due to the high similarity between images from the same videos. By using a 80% training/20% testing random split on videos instead of images, they ensured a more robust and generalizable model.

In addition, the researchers provided a boxplot representation of precision, recall, and F-measure metrics obtained for the 5 CNN models built through cross-validation. The results showed that models trained with only the 3 common shark species of interest had higher correlation coefficients (R = 0.88 and 0.85 for video clips and 1-hour video datasets, respectively) compared to models trained on 27 species. However, the correlation was highest for C. amblyrhynchos (R = 0.90) using the video clips dataset, indicating that the model generalized well to this species.

In summary, the researchers used a diverse dataset, cross-validation, and a 80% training/20% testing random split on videos to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model. These measures helped improve the model's ability to perform well on unseen data and provided insights into its robustness and performance across different shark species.
