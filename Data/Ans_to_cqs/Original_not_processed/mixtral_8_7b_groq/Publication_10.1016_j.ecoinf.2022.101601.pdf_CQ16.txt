Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the PermaBN model, such as a validation loss plateau.

However, it is mentioned that the PermaBN model development process includes a unique validation stage where the model is reviewed by a group of experts at Texas A&M University. This stage involves discussing the conceptual model and reviewing the results of prognostic and diagnostic experiments (Appendix B). It can be inferred that the experts likely assess the model's performance and provide feedback, which might contribute to determining when training is complete.

Additionally, the context references other studies that use various methods for model validation, such as comparing model predictions with observed data (Getoor et al., 2004; Frauenfeld et al., 2004). However, these studies do not specifically mention using a validation loss plateau as a criterion for determining when training is complete.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the PermaBN model, it can be inferred that expert assessment plays a role in the validation process. There is no mention of a validation loss plateau as a specific criterion for determining when training is complete.
