Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct information given about the code repository link of a deep learning pipeline. The texts mention various studies and tools related to geographic information systems, microbial community functions, machine learning, and microbiology, but they do not provide a specific link to a deep learning pipeline's code repository.

In the context, there are references to RStudio, R packages (rgbif, shiny), and the R environment, but these are mainly used for data extraction, analysis, and visualization. There is no indication that a deep learning pipeline's code repository is associated with these tools or platforms.

To find the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline, you may look for additional information from the QGIS Development Team, the Open Source Geospatial Foundation, or the authors of the studies mentioned in the context. You can check their websites, repositories, or publications for further details about the deep learning pipeline and its code repository.
