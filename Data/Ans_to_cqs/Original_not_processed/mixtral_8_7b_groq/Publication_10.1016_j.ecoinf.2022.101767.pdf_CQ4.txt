I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not mention any deep learning pipeline or data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context focuses on a study that analyzed wild bird videos from YouTube, including data extraction and classification of thumbnail characteristics. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given information.
