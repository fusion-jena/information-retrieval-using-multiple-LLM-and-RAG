Answer:::

The hyperparameters of the random forest (RF) model were optimized using the internal RF function TuneRF. This function calculates the optimal number of variables (M) to consider at each split, starting from the default value and finding the value with the minimum out-of-bag (OOB) error rate below and above a threshold value (one-third of the total number of variables for regression). The function looks below and above this threshold for the value with the minimum OOB error rate.

In this study, an alternate method of successive screening was used to determine the optimal parameter M, instead of using a grid or random search. This method attempts to take all variables into account, rather than searching through a predefined grid of hyperparameter values.

The TuneRF function was used to find the optimal value of M, which is the number of variables to try at each split. The number of trees to run (Nt) was not explicitly mentioned as being optimized, but it is also a hyperparameter that can be tuned in RF models.

In summary, the hyperparameters of the RF model were optimized using the internal TuneRF function, which calculates the optimal number of variables to consider at each split. An alternate method of successive screening was used to determine the optimal parameter M, instead of a grid or random search.
