Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the specific type of deep learning model used in the study. The context mainly discusses the image acquisition and processing techniques used for remote sensing data, as well as a table showing the correlation between total soil nitrogen (TSN) and total soil phosphorus (TSP) with various physiographic positions.

Therefore, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the study based on the provided context.
