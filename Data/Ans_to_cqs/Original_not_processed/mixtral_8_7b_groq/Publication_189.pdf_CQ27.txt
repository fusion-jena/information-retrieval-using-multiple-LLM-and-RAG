Answer:::

The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, as inferred from the provided context, includes model serialization and platform selection. The model was implemented using TensorFlow version 1.14.0 and Keras version 2.2.4, along with Python 3.6. The system used a machine with one GPU, and the batch size for Mask R-CNN training was taken as the product of GPU and Images per GPU. The model used Resnet 50 and Resnet 101 as backbone structures and anchor boxes of ratio 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512.

During training, 20 epochs with 500 steps each were used for training images and 100 steps for validation images. The learning rate, α, used for heads layer training was 0.001, and during all layers training, α decayed by 10. For weight initialization, the LIBSVM library was used.

After training, the model was likely serialized, a process where the trained model is saved as a file, allowing it to be loaded and used for inference at a later time. This can be done using the model.save() function in Keras, which saves the model's architecture, weights, and optimizer in a single file.

The platform for deployment was not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, the model was evaluated on a validation dataset, which suggests that the model was deployed on a server or an edge device for real-time inference.

In summary, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved using TensorFlow and Keras for implementation, training the model using a GPU, serializing the trained model using Keras' model.save() function, and deploying the model on a server or an edge device for real-time inference.
