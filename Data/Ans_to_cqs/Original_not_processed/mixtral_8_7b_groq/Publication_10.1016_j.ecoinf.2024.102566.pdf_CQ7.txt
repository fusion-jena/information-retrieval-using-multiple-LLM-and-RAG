The provided context does not include specific information on the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does offer insights into the importance of high-quality training samples and the use of remote sensing data for biomass estimation.

In the study by Chen (2007), the insufficiency of high-quality training samples led to the employment of a low data dependency method that integrates forest inventory data with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation. This suggests that the selection of appropriate training data, potentially including remote sensing imagery, is crucial for the development of accurate and reliable models for biomass estimation.

The table provided in the context shows the spatial distribution of downscaled forest biomass density for needleleaf forests, broadleaf forests, and mixed forests across different inventory periods. This data could be used to create a training dataset for a deep learning model, with the inventory periods serving as different categories. The model could then be trained to predict biomass density based on the forest type and inventory period.

To split this data into training, test, and validation sets, a common approach is to use a ratio such as 70% for training, 15% for testing, and 15% for validation. The training set is used to train the model, the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data, and the validation set is used to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

Another approach is to use k-fold cross-validation, where the data is split into k subsets, and the model is trained and tested k times, each time using a different subset as the test set and the remaining k-1 subsets as the training set. This approach provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance and helps to prevent overfitting.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly answer the query, it suggests that the selection of appropriate training data, potentially including remote sensing imagery, is crucial for the development of accurate and reliable models for biomass estimation. When splitting data for deep learning model training, a common approach is to use a ratio such as 70% for training, 15% for testing, and 15% for validation, or to use k-fold cross-validation for a more robust estimate of the model's performance.
