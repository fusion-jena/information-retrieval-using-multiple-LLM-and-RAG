Based on the provided context, there is no information given about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the use of drought indices, correlation analysis, and the investigation of groundwater-climate interactions, but it does not mention any specific methods for hyperparameter optimization such as grid search or random search. Hyperparameter optimization is an important aspect of machine learning and deep learning models, as it can significantly impact the performance of the model. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves systematically trying out different combinations of hyperparameters, while random search involves randomly selecting hyperparameters to try. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic model to make informed decisions about which hyperparameters to try next. However, without further information, it is not possible to answer this query.
