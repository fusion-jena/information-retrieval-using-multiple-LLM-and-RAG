Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, the context does mention that the LSTM model and VR + SVR models were evaluated on test observations, and the results were reported in Table 5. The table includes the number of observations in the training set, as well as the number of observations in the test set with at least one of the two channels out of the range between the minimum and maximum values of the training set. This suggests that some form of data splitting was performed, although it is not clear if it was stratified or not.

Additionally, the context mentions that the LSTM model was not able to predict the values of concentration in 13% of test observations due to the absence of a long enough sequence of previous observations without missing values in the input features. This implies that the data may have been preprocessed to handle missing values, which could affect the model's generalizability.

Overall, while the context does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it suggests that some form of data splitting and preprocessing was performed. However, further information would be needed to make a definitive conclusion.
