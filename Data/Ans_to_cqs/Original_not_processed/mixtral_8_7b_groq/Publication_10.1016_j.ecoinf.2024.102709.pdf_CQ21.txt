Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps applied after the model training. However, it does mention that they used mAP50 (mean Average Precision) as a metric to evaluate the model's performance. This metric is commonly used in object detection tasks to measure the quality of the bounding boxes predicted by the model.

Additionally, the context mentions that they investigated YOLO training losses for each model, which suggests that they might have used other metrics specific to the YOLO architecture, such as box loss, objectness loss, and classification loss.

There is no mention of techniques like saliency maps or confusion matrices being used. Saliency maps are often used for visualizing the parts of the input image that the model is focusing on, while confusion matrices are used for evaluating the performance of classification models.

In summary, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps after model training include investigating YOLO training losses and calculating mAP50 as a metric for evaluating the model's performance in object detection tasks. However, there is no explicit information about the use of saliency maps or confusion matrices.
