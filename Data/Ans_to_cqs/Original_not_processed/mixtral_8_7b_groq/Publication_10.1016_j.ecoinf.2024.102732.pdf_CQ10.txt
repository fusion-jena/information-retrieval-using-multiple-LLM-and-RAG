Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context consists of various research papers related to machine learning, forest ecosystem services, and biomass estimation. However, none of them have mentioned or provided a link to a deep learning pipeline's code repository.

An alternative suggestion is to look into the following research papers that either use deep learning techniques or are related to the topic, which might help you find a suitable code repository:

1. Ryu, S.-E., Shin, D.-H., Chung, K., 2020. Prediction model of dementia risk based on XGBoost using derived variable extraction and hyperparameter optimization. IEEE Access 8, 177708â€“177720.
   This paper uses XGBoost, a type of gradient boosting machine (GBM), which is an ensemble learning method but not a deep learning technique.

2. Chen, T., Lv, L., Wang, D., Zhang, J., Yang, Y., Zhao, Z., Wang, C., Guo, X., Chen, H., Wang, Q., 2023b. Revolutionizing Agrifood systems with artificial intelligence: a survey. arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.01899.
   This survey paper discusses artificial intelligence techniques, including deep learning, in the context of agrifood systems. It might provide insights into deep learning applications in a related field.

3. Sa, R., Fan, W., 2023. Estimation of Forest parameters in boreal artificial coniferous forests using Landsat 8 and sentinel-2A. Remote Sens. 15, 3605.
   This paper uses machine learning techniques for forest parameter estimation, but it does not mention deep learning specifically.

4. Shahzad, F., Mehmood, K., Hussain, K., Haidar, I., Anees, S.A., Muhammad, S., Ali, J., Adnan, M., Wang, Z., Feng, Z., 2024. Comparing machine learning algorithms to predict vegetation fire detections in Pakistan. Fire Ecol. 20 https://doi.org/10.1186/s42408-024-00289-5.
   This paper compares machine learning algorithms for vegetation fire detection, but it does not focus on deep learning.

You can search for deep learning code repositories on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket by looking for projects related to your specific application, such as biomass estimation, forest ecosystem services, or remote sensing.
