Answer:::
In the provided context, the deep learning model in use is a ResNet 100 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for image classification tasks. This is evident in the statement "We used ResNet 100... as our classic deep-learning algorithm. Resnet... is a DL architecture which is able to both extract features from images and classify these images thanks to those features." The model's purpose is to classify images, specifically underwater images, into different species classes. However, the unique challenge in this task is the limited dataset, which typically contains only 1-5 thumbnails per class. This is addressed in the proposal to explore few-shot learning (FSL), an emerging research field, to overcome the limitations of classic DL algorithms that require thousands of annotated images to learn to discriminate classes. The aim is to develop a model that can accurately classify underwater species images with a minimal number of training samples.
