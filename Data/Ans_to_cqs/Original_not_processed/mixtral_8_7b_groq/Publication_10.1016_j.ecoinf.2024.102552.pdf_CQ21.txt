The provided context does not include information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention some techniques used in the process of data analysis and model development, such as:

1. Formal analysis: This refers to the process of applying mathematical or statistical theories to the data. It could include techniques like feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, or statistical testing.
2. Validation: This is the process of checking the model's performance, often by comparing its predictions to actual data. Techniques like confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1 score could be used for validation.
3. Visualization: This is the process of presenting the data or the model's results in a graphical format. It could include techniques like saliency maps, which highlight the areas of the input that the model considers most important for its predictions.

It's important to note that the specific postprocessing steps depend on the type of model and the specific problem being addressed. For example, in the context of image classification, saliency maps can be used to visualize the areas of the image that the model considers most important for its predictions. Confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1 score can be used to evaluate the performance of the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the postprocessing steps after model training, it does mention some techniques that are commonly used in data analysis and model development, such as formal analysis, validation, and visualization. The specific postprocessing steps depend on the type of model and the problem being addressed.
