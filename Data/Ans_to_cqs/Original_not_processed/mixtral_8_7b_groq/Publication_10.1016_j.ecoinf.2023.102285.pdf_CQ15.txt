Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline of the study by Çalıs¸kan (2023). However, it is mentioned that deep learning models are used for detecting human activity types from 3D posture data. In general, deep learning models often use optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSprop to minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance. For instance, the study by Han et al. (2022) mentioned in the context uses a deep learning technique called LCSE-ResNet and it is likely that they used an optimization technique in their deep learning pipeline, but the specific technique is not provided in the context. Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to give a specific answer to this query.
