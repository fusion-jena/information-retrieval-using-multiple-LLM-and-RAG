Based on the provided context, there are no explicit details mentioned regarding the criteria used to split the data for training the deep learning model (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to split the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to train the model, updating the model's parameters based on the observed losses and gradients. The validation set, also known as the development set, is used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model during the training process. It helps in monitoring the model's performance and tuning hyperparameters. Finally, the test set is used to evaluate the model's generalization capability after the completion of the training process.

In the context provided, the authors have mentioned that they have trained the model for 140 epochs and measured its performance. However, they have not explicitly stated the criteria used for splitting the data. It is possible that they used a single dataset for both training and testing or employed a separate validation set for monitoring and tuning the model during training.

In summary, while the provided context does not offer specific information about the data splitting criteria, it is common practice to divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets in deep learning projects.
