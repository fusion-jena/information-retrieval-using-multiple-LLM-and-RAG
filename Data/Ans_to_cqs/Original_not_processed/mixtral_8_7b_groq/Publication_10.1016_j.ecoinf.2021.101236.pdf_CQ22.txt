Answer:::
The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include mean average precision (mAP) at the sample level, class-wise mean average precision (cmAP), top-1 accuracy, F0.5 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC).

The mAP and cmAP metrics are used for comparability reasons and have been employed in past editions of BirdCLEF, a benchmark for bird sound recognition. These metrics are particularly suitable for multi-label classification scenarios, which is the case for classifying 984 bird species.

The class-wise evaluation using cmAP provides a balanced measure, ensuring that the true positive rate for each species contributes equally to the score. This is important for precise primary predictions, as common species are more likely to occur in a recording.

In addition to mAP, cmAP, and F0.5 score, the top-1 accuracy is used to assess the model's performance. Top-1 accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions among the top-1 predicted classes.

The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is another evaluation metric used to quantify the model's performance. AUC measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve (a plot of true positive rate vs. false positive rate) and provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds.

These metrics offer a comprehensive evaluation of the deep learning model's performance, addressing various aspects of the model's classification capabilities.
