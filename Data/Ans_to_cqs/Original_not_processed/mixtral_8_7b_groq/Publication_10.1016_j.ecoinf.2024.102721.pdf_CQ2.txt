Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study is about forecasting ecological water demand of an arid oasis under a drying climate scenario based on deep learning methods. It can be inferred that the input data is likely to be time-series data related to ecological water demand, groundwater level, hydrochemistry, rainfall-runoff, and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) among others. These data could be in the form of CSV files or other tabular formats. The context does not mention the use of image, audio, or video data formats in the deep learning pipeline.
