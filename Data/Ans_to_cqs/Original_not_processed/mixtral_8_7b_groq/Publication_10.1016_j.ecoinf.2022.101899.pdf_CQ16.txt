Based on the provided context, there are no specific details about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the described model building process. The text focuses on the model selection and evaluation after the training phase.

However, it is common in machine learning and statistical modeling to use various criteria to determine when training is complete. One of the most common methods is to monitor the validation loss (or error) and stop the training process when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model is overfitting to the training data. This is often referred to as early stopping.

Another approach is to set a maximum number of training iterations or epochs, after which the training process is automatically stopped. This can help prevent overfitting and ensure that the model training time is manageable.

In addition, some models use convergence criteria based on the change in model parameters or likelihood values to determine when training is complete. For example, in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, the training process can be stopped when the chain has reached convergence, which can be assessed using various diagnostic tests and plots.

In the context of the provided text, it is possible that the training process was determined to be complete based on one or more of these criteria. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
