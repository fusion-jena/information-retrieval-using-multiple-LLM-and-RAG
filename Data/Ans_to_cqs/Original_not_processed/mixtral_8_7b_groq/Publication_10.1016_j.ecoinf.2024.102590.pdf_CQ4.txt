Based on the provided context, there is no information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context focuses on the use of a supervised learning workflow, specifically a Random Forest classifier with GLCM texture metrics for land cover classification. It explains the process of sampling point collection, vegetation type identification, and image classification. However, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
