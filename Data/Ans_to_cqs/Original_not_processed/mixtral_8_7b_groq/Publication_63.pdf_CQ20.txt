Answer:::

The deep learning models in the study were trained using two CUDA-compatible NVIDIA GPUs, specifically the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti. This information is provided in the context when it mentions that "All CNN were implemented using the Keras API version (2.3.0.0)54 and the TensorFlow backend (version 2.2.0)55 in R (version 3.6.3)23. Model training was undergone on a workstation with two CUDA-compatible NVIDIA GPUs (GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, CUDA version 11.0)." This suggests that the models were trained using these high-performance GPUs to handle the computational requirements of the deep learning models.
