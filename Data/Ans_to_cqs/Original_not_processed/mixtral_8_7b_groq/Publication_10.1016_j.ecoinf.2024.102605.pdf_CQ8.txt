Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context includes the titles and authors of two articles from Ecological Informatics, a CRediT authorship contribution statement, a declaration of competing interest, data availability statement, and acknowledgments. However, none of these sections mention the code repository or its location. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.

An alternative approach would be to contact the corresponding author of the articles, Siyuan Zhang, to inquire about the code repository. The corresponding author's contact information can be found in the published articles or by searching the journal's website. They may be able to provide access to the code or direct you to the appropriate location.

It is important to note that not all studies make their code publicly available, and there could be various reasons for this decision. Nonetheless, making code publicly available promotes transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in research.
