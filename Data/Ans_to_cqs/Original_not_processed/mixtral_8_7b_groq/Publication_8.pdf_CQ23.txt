Answer:::

The generalizability of a deep learning model refers to its ability to perform well on unseen data. Several measures were taken in the provided context to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model for identifying plant organs in herbarium sheets.

Firstly, a diverse dataset was used for training the model. The model was initially trained on a subset of 498 images, and then on all 653 annotated images from the Herbarium Senckenbergianum (FR), which consists of a different set of species and geographical origins compared to the training dataset. This provided the model with a diverse range of features to learn from, improving its ability to generalize to new data.

Secondly, transfer learning was implemented to initialize the model weights pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. This allowed the initial layers of the CNN to learn very generic features that can be used in new contexts, while the deeper layers were fine-tuned during training using the annotated herbarium scan dataset. This helped to prevent overfitting and improved the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Thirdly, the model was evaluated on a test subset of 155 images, which were not used in the training process. This allowed for an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance and provided insights into its ability to generalize to new data.

However, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a machine learning model by dividing the dataset into k subsets, or folds, and training and testing the model k times, each time using a different fold for testing. Stratified splitting is a technique used to ensure that the distribution of classes is similar in both the training and testing datasets. These techniques could have been used to further ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
