I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not contain information about a deep learning model and its associated hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. The context focuses on the "ppmlasso" package, which is used for spatial econometrics and specifically for Poisson Pseudo-Maximum Likelihood (PPML) estimation with lasso regularization.

The mentioned hyperparameters in the context are:

1. sp.scale: the spatial resolution for the quadrature grid in kilometers.
2. cov.bias: the column number of the variable chosen as a proxy for the observer bias.
3. kVal: the value to factor out of the observer bias proxy cov.bias.
4. n.fits: the number of models to fit through the regularization path.

These hyperparameters are related to the ppmlasso model and not to a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide the information you are looking for based on the given context.
