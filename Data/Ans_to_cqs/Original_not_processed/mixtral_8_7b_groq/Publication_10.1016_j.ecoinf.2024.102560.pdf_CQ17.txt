Answer:::

The pieces of context provided do not directly discuss the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, some of the sources mention the use of artificial neural networks, which can be a part of deep learning pipelines.

Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models, including deep learning pipelines. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization methods introduce a penalty on the model's complexity to prevent overfitting.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization technique used during training to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out, or setting to zero, a proportion of the neurons in a layer. This helps to break the co-adaptations between neurons and improves the model's generalization ability.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a technique that adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the sum of the squares of the model's weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, reducing the risk of overfitting.

In summary, dropout and L2 regularization are two common regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. These techniques introduce a penalty on the model's complexity to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability.
