Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. There is no information indicating if it is hosted on GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query. However, the context does mention Whiskerbook.org, which is the website where the snow leopard dataset and the AI-based individual identification system are available. It is possible that the code repository might be linked from that website, so I would recommend checking there for more information.
