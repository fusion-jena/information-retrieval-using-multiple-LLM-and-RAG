Answer:

The text does not provide direct information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that they optimized the structure and hyperparameters of the RF, ANN, and LightGBM models using Optuna 2.10.0. Optuna is a hyperparameter optimization framework that uses Bayesian optimization, which can help in finding a good set of hyperparameters that generalize well to unseen data.

In addition, the performance of the algorithms was evaluated by comparing the loss function (mean squared error) of the optimized models. Mean squared error is a common choice of loss function for regression problems, and it is less sensitive to outliers compared to mean absolute error. This could indicate that they were concerned about the model's performance on the entire dataset and not just a few specific instances.

Furthermore, the text mentions that the optimized ANN models did not have any intermediate layers, and the model with the input layer followed by the output layer was determined to be the best. This suggests that they might have considered simpler models to avoid overfitting, which can improve the model's generalizability.

Overall, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, it does provide some evidence that they took measures to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using Bayesian optimization, evaluating the model's performance on the entire dataset, and considering simpler models to avoid overfitting.
