Answer:::
I am unable to provide a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study you provided, as it was not included in the given context. However, the study does mention the use of three machine learning models: Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). These models were trained and tested using historical water quality data from the Santiago River in Mexico.

The data pre-processing steps involved outlier detection and artificial data replacement, followed by training the models with the full dataset of 13 monitoring sites and a subset composed of the most representative and variable water quality scenarios. The performance of the models was evaluated using root-mean-square-error (RMSE), mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2).

If you are interested in implementing these models for your own purposes, you may be able to find existing code repositories for each of these models online. For example, you might search for "ANFIS GitHub" or "Artificial Neural Network Python" to find implementations of these models in various programming languages. Keep in mind that you may need to adapt any existing code to fit your specific use case and data.
