Answer:::

The generalizability of the deep learning model, specifically the convolutional neural network (AlexNet), was ensured through several measures. First, the picture dataset was divided into training and testing sets, consisting of 80% and 20% of the total 6570 pictures, respectively. This splitting of the dataset allowed for the model to be trained on a subset of the data and then tested on unseen data, thereby evaluating its performance on new, unencountered examples. 

To further ensure the consistency of the model's performance, the training-testing process was repeated 10 times for each algorithm, including AlexNet. In each of these (pseudo-)replicate runs, all five algorithms used the same training and testing picture subsets. This step helped in assessing the reliability and robustness of the model's performance across different iterations.

However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting. Cross-validation is a technique where the data is further divided into k-folds, and the model is trained and tested k times, each time with a different fold as the testing set and the remaining k-1 folds as the training set. Stratified splitting, on the other hand, is a method used to ensure that the distribution of classes remains similar in both the training and testing sets, especially when dealing with imbalanced classes. The use of these techniques would have further strengthened the generalizability of the model.

Answer:::

In summary, the generalizability of the deep learning model was addressed by splitting the dataset into training and testing sets and repeating the training-testing process multiple times. However, the use of cross-validation and stratified splitting, which could have additional positive impacts on the model's generalizability, is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
