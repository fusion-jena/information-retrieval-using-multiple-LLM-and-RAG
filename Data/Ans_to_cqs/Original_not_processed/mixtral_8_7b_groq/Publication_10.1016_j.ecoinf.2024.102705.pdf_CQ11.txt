Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses a study that proposes a compact network with a non-local layer for adaptive image processing in ecological tasks, particularly for camera trap images. However, it does not mention or provide a link to any data repository related to this deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
