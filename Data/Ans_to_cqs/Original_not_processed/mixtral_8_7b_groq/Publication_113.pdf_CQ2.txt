Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline used in the study focuses on object detection in camera trap images for ecological data. The data formats specifically mentioned are image data and 256-dimensional feature space vectors.

In the first step of the pipeline, a pre-trained detector model is run on images. This implies that the input data format for this stage is image data. The specific format (e.g., JPEG, PNG) is not mentioned in the context.

After running the pre-trained detector model, the obtained crops (i.e., regions of interest in the images containing objects) are then embedded into a lower-dimensional space, specifically a 256-dimensional feature space. This step transforms the image crops into vector representations, changing the data format from image data to numerical feature vectors.

The context does not mention other data formats like audio or video. Therefore, based on the given information, the deep learning pipeline primarily works with image data and 256-dimensional feature space vectors.
