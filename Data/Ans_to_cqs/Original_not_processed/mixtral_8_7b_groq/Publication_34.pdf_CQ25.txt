Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning models used in the study described is not explicitly stated as a specific type of task such as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, based on the context provided, it can be inferred that the models are being used for regression analysis in the context of species distribution modeling.

In the study, the authors use three types of deep learning models: SNN (Simple Neural Network), DNN (Deep Neural Network), and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to predict the count of species i, conditionally on its corresponding input x. This is achieved by modeling the parameter of the Poisson distribution of the random response variable yi, which is the count of species i, using the formula λm,θ (x) = exp(γ T i aNh,(x, θ )) where θ represents the model parameters.

The SNN and DNN models are fully connected neural networks, while the CNN model is an extension of neural networks that are particularly suited for dealing with input data with very large dimensions. The CNN model is of particular interest in modeling species distribution because it can capture the effect of spatial environmental patterns.

The authors mention that there is still work to be done on quick automated procedures for tuning optimization hyper-parameters, especially the initial learning rate, and they are looking for a more suited stopping rule. They also mention that in the case of models of species distributions, they can imagine minimizing the number of non-null connections in the network to make it more interpretable and introducing an L1-type penalty on the network parameters.

In summary, the purpose of the deep learning models used in this study is to perform regression analysis for species distribution modeling by predicting the count of species i, conditionally on its corresponding input x.
