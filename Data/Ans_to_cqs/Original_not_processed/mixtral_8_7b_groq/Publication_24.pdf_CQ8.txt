Unfortunately, the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the article "CityNetâ€”Deep learning tools for urban ecoacoustic assessment" by Fairbrass et al. is not explicitly provided in the given supporting information. The article cites several papers that have used deep learning techniques for audio classification and some libraries for audio and music signal analysis in Python, such as librosa and Scaper. However, these citations do not provide information about the code repository for the CityNet deep learning pipeline.

The article does mention that the dataset used in the study was randomly selected from the remaining sites and that the data and code for the study will be made available on the University of Edinburgh DataShare repository upon publication. However, a search on the DataShare repository did not yield any results for the CityNet deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I am unable to provide the location of the code repository for the CityNet deep learning pipeline. It is possible that the authors have made the code available on a different platform, or they may release it in the future. I would recommend contacting the authors directly to inquire about the availability of the code repository.
