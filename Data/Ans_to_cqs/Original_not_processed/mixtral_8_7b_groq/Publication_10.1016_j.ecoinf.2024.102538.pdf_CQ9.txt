Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. There is no mention of where the datasets used in the study, BirdCLEF2018-Small (BC-S), BirdCLEF2018-Large (BC-L), Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata (LS), and Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata (LS*), are available or whether they have been shared in a data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.

The context focuses on the introduction and evaluation of the Phylogenetic Perspective Neural Network (PPNN) model for bird acoustic recognition, including the dataset construction, model architecture, and experimental results. However, it does not specify the data repository or data sharing platforms used for the study.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
