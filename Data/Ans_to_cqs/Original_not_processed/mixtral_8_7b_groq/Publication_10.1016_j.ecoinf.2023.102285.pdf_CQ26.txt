Answer: The provided context does not give specific details about the data bias techniques used during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some techniques that were used in the methodology of the study. These include using a three-phase evaluation process for the model, which involves training, testing, and evaluation by field experts with a new dataset. Additionally, the study used table 3 to outline the experimental design of data utilization and data processing phases with their targeted objectives. The study also mentions the use of bespoke semi-supervised ML approaches, such as SelfMatch, for addressing research questions. However, these techniques do not directly relate to addressing data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query based on the given context.
