Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses a study conducted in Xi'an, China, focusing on carbon emissions and NPP-VIIRS-like NTL data. It mentions various data sources, formulas, and processes for calculating carbon emissions, but it does not specify the method used for hyperparameter optimization.

Hyperparameter optimization is a crucial aspect of machine learning model development, as it helps to find the best set of parameters for a given model and dataset. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and gradient-based optimization.

In the context provided, the study might have employed one of these methods for hyperparameter optimization during the construction of their provincial-scale fitting models. However, without explicit information, it is impossible to give a definitive answer.

Answer::: I don't know the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization in this study, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
