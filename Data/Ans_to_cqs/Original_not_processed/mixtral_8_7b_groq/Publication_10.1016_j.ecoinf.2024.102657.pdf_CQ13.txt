Answer:::
 The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, specifically the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the only hyperparameter of the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) model is the value of k, which was fixed as k = 4.

In the case of the CNN model, the context only mentions that "No additional preprocessing was applied to the spectrograms as the goal was to do the least amount of preprocessing possible in order to demonstrate the power of human-machine teaming." This implies that any default hyperparameters of the CNN model were used without modification.

Furthermore, the context states that "the CNNâ€™s accuracy on the filtered data averaged to 99.22% and the accuracy on the non-filtered data averaged to 99.25%." This suggests that the CNN model was already trained and tested, and its performance was evaluated on both filtered and non-filtered data.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the CNN model's hyperparameters were set to default values or were not explicitly mentioned in the context provided.
