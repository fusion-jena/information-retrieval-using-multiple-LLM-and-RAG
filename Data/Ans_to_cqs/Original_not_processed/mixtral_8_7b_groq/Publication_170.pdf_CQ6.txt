Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are several preprocessing steps mentioned that are involved before training a deep learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. However, the context does not explicitly mention normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Firstly, the context mentions that the DCNN model of the study was the AlexNet model, which included convolutional layers and fully connected layers. Except for the last fully connected layer, each layer performed Local Response Normalization (LRN) processing and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function processing. This suggests that normalization is one of the preprocessing steps involved in training a deep learning model.

Secondly, the context mentions that the first, second, and fifth convolutional layers performed a downsampling operation using the mean pooling method. This step reduces the spatial size of the convolved feature. Therefore, it can be inferred that some form of scaling or resizing of the input images may be necessary before training the model.

Thirdly, the context mentions that the models were trained using the zero-start and incremental training mode, respectively. The zero-start training mode initialized the model with randomly-generated parameters and then trained the model on a training set. This suggests that some form of initialization of the model parameters is necessary before training the model.

Lastly, the context mentions that the preprocessing of the images may affect the recognition rate of the model. Specifically, it mentions that the preprocessing of the images in another study was more complex, which may have affected their recognition rate. However, the context does not explicitly mention what the preprocessing steps were.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include Local Response Normalization (LRN) processing, Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function processing, downsampling operation using the mean pooling method, initialization of the model parameters, and potentially other unmentioned steps such as image resizing, and data augmentation.
