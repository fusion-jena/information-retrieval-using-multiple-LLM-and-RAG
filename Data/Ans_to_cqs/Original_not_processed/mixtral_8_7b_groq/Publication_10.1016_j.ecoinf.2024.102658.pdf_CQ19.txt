Answer:::

The provided text does not contain information about the use of deep learning models in the model exploration process. The models mentioned are Bayesian logistic regression, MLE logistic regression, Bayesian GAM (Generalized Additive Model), and random forest. These are all machine learning models but not deep learning models. Deep learning models like TensorFlow and PyTorch are not mentioned or implied in the given context. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query about which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model in this specific work.
