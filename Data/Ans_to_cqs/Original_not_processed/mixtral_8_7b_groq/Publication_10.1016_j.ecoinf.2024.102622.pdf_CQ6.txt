Based on the provided context, there are no specific preprocessing steps mentioned for training a deep learning model. However, there are some preprocessing techniques mentioned for remote sensing images and vegetation indices that can be useful in the context of training a deep learning model for agricultural applications.

In the context of remote sensing images, atmospheric correction is an important preprocessing step. For example, Guo and Zeng (2012) compared the atmospheric correction of SPOT-5 images based on the FLAASH and QUAC models. This step is important for removing atmospheric effects and improving the accuracy of image analysis.

In the context of vegetation indices, normalization is a common preprocessing step. For instance, Jasinski (1990) studied the sensitivity of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to subpixel canopy cover, soil albedo, and pixel scale. Normalization involves scaling the vegetation index values to a common range, which can improve the model's ability to learn the relationships between the input and output variables.

Another preprocessing step that can be useful for deep learning models is data augmentation. This involves creating new training examples by applying transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping. Data augmentation can help improve the model's ability to generalize to new data and reduce overfitting.

In summary, while there are no specific preprocessing steps mentioned in the provided context for training a deep learning model for agricultural applications, techniques such as atmospheric correction, normalization, and data augmentation can be useful for improving the accuracy and generalizability of the model.
