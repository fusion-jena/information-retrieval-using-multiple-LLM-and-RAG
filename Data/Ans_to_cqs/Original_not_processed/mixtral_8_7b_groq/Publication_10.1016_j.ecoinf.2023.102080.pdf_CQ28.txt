Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model.

The context includes two articles published in the Ecological Informatics journal, both by Adde et al. (EcologicalInformatics75(2023)1020805 and EcologicalInformatics75(2023)1020804). However, neither of these articles mentions the deployment platform for any deep learning models.

The first article (EcologicalInformatics75(2023)1020805) focuses on comparing the computation time needed for different covariate selection procedures and model fitting steps in species distribution modeling. The authors used the University of Lausanne HPC cluster with a 10-core central processing unit strategy and AMDÂ® EPYC 7402 for their analyses. However, there is no information about deep learning models or their deployment platforms.

The second article (EcologicalInformatics75(2023)1020804) is a contents list for the Ecological Informatics journal, and it does not provide any additional information about the deep learning model or its deployment platform.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the platform used for deploying the deep learning model.
