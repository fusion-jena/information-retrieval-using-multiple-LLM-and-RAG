The provided context discusses the training of a neural network for plant identification, but it does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some implicit strategies that can be inferred.

One way to handle randomness is through the use of a fixed seed value. Although the context does not mention the use of a seed value explicitly, it does mention the use of specific hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size. If these values are kept constant across multiple runs, this can help to reduce randomness in the training process.

Another way to handle randomness is through the use of data augmentation techniques. Data augmentation involves creating new training examples by applying random transformations to the existing data. This can help to increase the size and diversity of the training set, which can improve the robustness and generalization of the trained model. The context mentions the use of data augmentation, but it does not provide details about how it is implemented.

The use of pre-trained models is another strategy to handle randomness. Pre-trained models are trained on large datasets and can be fine-tuned on smaller datasets for specific tasks. This can help to reduce the amount of randomness in the training process, as the pre-trained model provides a good starting point for the fine-tuning process. The context mentions the use of pre-trained models for plant identification, but it does not provide details about how they are implemented.

Finally, the use of a specific optimization algorithm can also help to handle randomness. The context mentions the use of the Adam optimizer, which is a variant of stochastic gradient optimization where the learning rate is adjusted automatically. This can help to reduce randomness in the training process, as the learning rate is adapted to the characteristics of the data and the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, there are some implicit strategies that can be inferred. These include the use of a fixed seed value, data augmentation techniques, pre-trained models, and specific optimization algorithms.
