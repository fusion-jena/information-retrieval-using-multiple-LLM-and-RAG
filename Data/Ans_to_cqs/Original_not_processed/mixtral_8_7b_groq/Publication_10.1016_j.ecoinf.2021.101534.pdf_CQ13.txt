Answer:::
The specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate and optimizer, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, we do have information about other training parameters.

The model used is YOLOv5s, which is the smallest weight of YOLOv5. It was trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 32 and an input image dimension of 640 x 640. The training process included data augmentation techniques such as scaling, color space adjustments, and Mosaic augmentation. Mosaic augmentation involves randomly selecting four original spectrograms, resizing, cropping, and color jittering them before merging into one big input image for model training.

The model was trained on a workstation equipped with an Intel Xeon E5-2660 V4 CPU * 2, DDR4 2400 ECC 16GB RAM * 8, NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU * 2, and WD black AN1500 4 TB NVMePCIe SSD * 2.

The input images for the model are spectrograms converted from mixed audio clips. These clips are transformed using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a window size of 1600 samples, a hop size of 400 samples (75% overlap), and 240 mel-scale frequency bins. Each spectrogram has a height of 438 pixels and a width of 436 pixels.

The recordings used for creating these clips are standardized and segmented into clips of a fixed duration. The clip length chosen is 3 seconds, which is based on the duration of most sound classes in their database being less than 3 seconds.

Without explicit information about the learning rate and optimizer, it's not possible to provide a complete answer to the query.
