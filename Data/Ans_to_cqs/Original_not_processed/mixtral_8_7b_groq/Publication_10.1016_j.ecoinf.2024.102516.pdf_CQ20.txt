Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions the use of a method called segmentation pre-training for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate plant cover, but it does not specify the hardware used to perform this training.

The method of segmentation pre-training involves using additional external training data and transfer learning to improve the performance of the CNN. This method is motivated by the fact that annotating images for plant cover estimation is laborious and often results in limited training data. The use of transfer learning and external training data can help to overcome these limitations.

The context also mentions the use of domain-related image data for pre-training, but it does not provide any details about the specific hardware or computational resources that were used to train the model.

In general, deep learning models like CNNs can be trained on various types of hardware, including CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. GPUs and TPUs are often used for training deep learning models because they are able to perform the large number of matrix and vector operations required for training these models more efficiently than CPUs. However, the specific hardware used for training the model in this case is not mentioned in the provided context.
