Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text mentions the use of existing deep learning (DL) models for classifying and detecting species or events of interest in survey data, and that these models output the relative probability that an event is from a specific data class. It also explains that the models are trainable from data, usually in a supervised fashion, with a learning algorithm like stochastic gradient descent. However, it does not specify the method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search, random search, or other techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
