Answer:::

The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that a ResNet50 model pre-trained on the ImageNet classification dataset is used as a baseline for comparison. The ImageNet dataset is a large-scale image recognition dataset consisting of over 14 million images and 1000 object classes, commonly used for training and evaluating computer vision models.

Additionally, the deep learning pipeline described in the given context involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for plant cover semantic segmentation using a dedicated plant cover dataset. The dataset is not named or described in detail, but it is mentioned that it contains plant species not present in the ImageNet dataset.

Therefore, while the exact datasets used in the pipeline are not specified, it is clear that the pipeline involves using a pre-trained ImageNet model as a baseline and training a custom CNN on a dedicated plant cover dataset.
