The provided context discusses the use of Species Distribution Models (SDMs) in the context of ecological informatics and deep learning, but it does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does imply that SDMs rely on the availability and quality of data at adequate scales.

In general, there are several methods used for collecting raw data in ecological studies, which could then be used in a deep learning pipeline for SDMs. These methods include:

1. Surveys: Ecologists may conduct field surveys to collect data on the presence and absence of species in a given area. Surveys can be conducted using various methods, such as visual observations, audio recordings, or trapping.
2. Sensors: Sensors can be used to collect data on environmental variables, such as temperature, humidity, and light levels. These sensors can be deployed in the field to collect data over time, providing a long-term record of environmental conditions.
3. Public datasets: There are many public datasets available that contain ecological data, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). These datasets can be used to obtain data on species occurrence and distribution, as well as environmental variables.
4. Remote sensing: Remote sensing technologies, such as satellite imagery, can be used to collect data on land cover, vegetation, and other environmental variables. These data can be used to infer the presence and distribution of species.

It is important to note that the choice of data collection method will depend on the research question being addressed, as well as the availability and quality of data. Additionally, the context mentions that there may not be enough data available to fit every type of model, and that computation time can be a limitation. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the data collection method and the type of model used in order to ensure that the results are reliable and accurate.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for SDMs, it is implied that the availability and quality of data at adequate scales is important. Common methods for collecting ecological data include surveys, sensors, public datasets, and remote sensing. The choice of data collection method will depend on the research question and the availability and quality of data.
