Answer: The data was split for deep learning model training into three sets: train, test, and validation. This split was done using a specific distribution of approximately 20% for the test set, 60% for the train set, and 20% for the validation set. This means that out of the 1938 input patch sizes of 256 Ã— 256 pixels, 388 patches were used for the test, 1162 for the train, and 388 for the validation. This distribution is a common practice in machine learning to ensure that the model has enough data to learn from, while also having a separate set of data to test its performance on and a validation set to fine-tune the model's parameters. Additionally, it is mentioned that other input patch sizes were tested, but the results did not change considerably and only increased the training time. This indicates that the chosen distribution and patch size were appropriate for the task at hand.
