Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline being available on GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other platform. The context focuses on discussing the impact of sampling bias in environmental covariates on species distribution models and land-use change models.

There are several studies and papers mentioned, such as El-Gabbas and Dormann (2018), Predicting Species Distributions Working Group (2008), Xian et al. (2023), Xu et al. (2023a, 2023b), Zhang and Zhu (2018), and others. However, none of these studies or papers mention or provide a code repository for a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to determine the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline.
