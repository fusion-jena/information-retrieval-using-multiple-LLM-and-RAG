Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the use of deep learning (DL) for satellite image analysis and the privacy concerns associated with processing sensitive data in the public cloud. It also discusses a novel approach called PPDL (Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning) that was applied to satellite images' data. However, it does not specify the platform where the DL model was deployed, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
