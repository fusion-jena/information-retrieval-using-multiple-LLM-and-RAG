Based on the provided context, the text does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the importance of avoiding overfitting and the challenges of generalizing deep learning models to new contexts, particularly in heterogeneous environments.

The authors of the Szegedy et al. (2015) paper introduce a deep convolutional neural network architecture, which typically requires regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. Common regularization methods for deep learning models include dropout, L1/L2 regularization, and data augmentation.

Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out a proportion of neurons during training, preventing over-reliance on specific neurons and thus reducing overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2014). L1/L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and preventing the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data. Data augmentation involves artificially expanding the training dataset by applying random transformations, such as rotation, scaling, or flipping, to the existing samples.

The Kattenborn et al. (2019a) paper discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for fine-grained segmentation of plant species and communities from high-resolution UAV imagery. While the authors do not explicitly mention regularization techniques, they emphasize the importance of avoiding overfitting and ensuring the model's transfer learning capabilities. Regularization methods, such as dropout and L1/L2 regularization, would be essential in this context to ensure the model's generalizability.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, it is reasonable to assume that techniques such as dropout, L1/L2 regularization, and data augmentation would be applied to ensure the model's generalizability and prevent overfitting.

Answer:::
Regularization methods such as dropout, L1/L2 regularization, and data augmentation are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Although the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, they would be essential for ensuring the model's generalizability and preventing overfitting in the discussed studies.
