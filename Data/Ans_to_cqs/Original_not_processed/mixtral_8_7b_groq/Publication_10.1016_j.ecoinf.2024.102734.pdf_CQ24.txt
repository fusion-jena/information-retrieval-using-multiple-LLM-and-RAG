Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, the text does describe a methodology for active learning in a deep learning context, which involves ranking and querying samples for user labeling. This process could be influenced by randomness, but the context does not provide information on how this is managed.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines can be crucial for reproducibility and stability of results. One common strategy is to set a fixed random seed value at the beginning of the training process. This ensures that the random initialization of weights and other stochastic processes, such as data shuffling or dropout, are reproducible across different runs.

Another strategy to handle randomness is to use techniques like cross-validation, which can help average out the effects of randomness by training and evaluating the model on different subsets of the data. This can provide a more robust estimate of the model's performance and help identify overfitting or underfitting issues.

In the context of active learning, randomness could be introduced in the selection of samples to be labeled. One way to handle this could be to use stratified sampling techniques, which ensure that the selected samples are representative of the overall distribution of classes or other relevant features. This can help avoid bias in the selection process and ensure that the model is trained on a diverse set of samples.

Overall, while the provided context does not mention specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, there are several general strategies that can be employed, such as setting a fixed random seed value, using cross-validation, and employing stratified sampling techniques in active learning.
