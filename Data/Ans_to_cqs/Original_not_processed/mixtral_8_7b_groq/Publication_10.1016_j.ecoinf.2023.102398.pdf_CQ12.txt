Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an attention mechanism. This is evident from the pieces of context provided. Firstly, the model includes a SENet attention mechanism, which is a type of attention mechanism used in conjunction with CNNs (refer to Fig. 4). Secondly, the model is trained using hyperparameters optimized for YOLOv5 COCO training, which is a CNN-based object detection model (refer to Table 2). Lastly, the training is done from scratch using GPU (Tesla T4) and CUDA Version-12.0 in Google Colab, which are commonly used for training CNNs (refer to the training details). Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN with an attention mechanism.
