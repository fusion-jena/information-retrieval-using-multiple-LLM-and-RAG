Answer:::

The provided context discusses the handling of class imbalance in the deep learning pipeline, which is a type of data bias. The text mentions that class imbalance can introduce undesirable bias, causing the classifier to predict over-represented classes more frequently. To address this issue, the authors adopted specific strategies during the training procedure.

First, they acknowledged the presence of class imbalance and its potential impact on classifier performance. They then proceeded to describe how they dealt with the class imbalance problem in their work. However, the context does not explicitly mention any preprocessing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

The approach they took was to ensure that the class imbalance problem was considered during the training procedure. Specifically, they used an early stopping procedure with a patience parameter to avoid overfitting. Additionally, they trained and executed each network with a different random initialization of trainable parameters and different data folds, averaging the results.

While these techniques do not directly address data bias during preprocessing, they do mitigate the impact of class imbalance on the model's performance during training. Therefore, it can be inferred that the authors focused on addressing data bias during the training phase rather than the preprocessing phase.
