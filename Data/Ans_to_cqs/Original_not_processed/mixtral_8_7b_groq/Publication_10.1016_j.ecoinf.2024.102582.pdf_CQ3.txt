The provided context does not discuss specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of very-high-resolution satellite imagery for mangrove forest analysis. In the context of remote sensing and geospatial analysis, data annotation techniques may include:

1. Image segmentation: Dividing an image into multiple segments or regions, each representing a specific land cover type or object. This can be done manually or using automated algorithms.

2. Object-based image analysis (OBIA): An approach that considers image objects (groups of pixels with similar spectral and textural characteristics) instead of individual pixels. OBIA can help improve the accuracy of land cover classification and object detection.

3. Pixel-based classification: Assigning a land cover class or object label to each pixel in an image based on its spectral signature.

4. Deep learning-based individual tree crown delineation: A method that uses deep learning algorithms to identify and delineate individual tree crowns in high-resolution satellite imagery. This can help improve the understanding of mangrove species distribution and evolution.

In the context of the Lassalle et al. (2022) study, 1800 training samples were generated using Google Earth Pro, with 300 samples for each land cover type. These samples were then used to train a random forest algorithm for land use type classification. After classification, manual visual interpretation was applied within a 10-km buffer zone to correct misclassifications between forest and mangroves.

While the context does not explicitly mention data annotation techniques, it is clear that a combination of manual and automated methods was used for data preparation and validation in the analysis of mangrove forests using satellite imagery.
