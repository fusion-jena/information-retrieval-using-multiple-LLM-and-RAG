The context provided does not give specific information about how the raw data was collected for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that the research team used aerial photos for interpretation and on-site investigations, but it does not specify whether these were the sources of the raw data or if they were used for some other purpose, such as determining the area of each forest type or identifying the number of bands to be used in the deep learning model.

It is possible that the raw data was collected using sensors mounted on aircraft or satellites, as aerial photos were used in the study. It is also possible that the raw data was obtained from public datasets or through surveys. However, without more information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this question.
