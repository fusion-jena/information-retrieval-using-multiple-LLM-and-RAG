Answer:::

In the context provided, there are four criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training: target training set, target test set, validation set, and attack set.

The target training set is used to train the target model. This set is derived from the Dtrain dataset, which is the training dataset. The target training set is used in conjunction with the learning algorithm A to train the model.

The target test set is used to assess the classification accuracy of the target model. This set is separate from the target training set and is used to evaluate the performance of the trained model on unseen samples.

The validation set is used to validate the hyperparameters of the target model. In the context provided, pictures of the target validation set are used as representatives of members. This set is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen samples.

The attack set contains examples of non-members that are required to train the attack model. This set is used to train an attack model that mimics the behavior of the target model. The attack model is then used to extract prediction vectors for each data point in the attack training and test datasets.

It's worth noting that the data splitting criteria can vary depending on the specific use case and the requirements of the model. However, in general, it's important to have a separate set for training, validation, and testing to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen samples and to prevent overfitting. Additionally, in the context of privacy-preserving machine learning, it's important to have a separate attack set to evaluate the vulnerability of the model to privacy attacks.
