Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the specific code repository for the deep learning pipeline that uses Wav2vec and a feed-forward neural network for bird species identification. It is common for research papers to not provide the code repository, but instead focus on the methodology and results of their study. However, some researchers do share their code to promote reproducibility and enable further development by the research community.

It is recommended to contact the authors of the research paper "EcologicalInformatics80(2024)1024714" by B. Swaminathan et al. to inquire if they have made the code repository available. They can be reached at their affiliated institutions or through research networking platforms like ResearchGate or LinkedIn.

If the code repository is not available, you can still implement the pipeline by following the details provided in the context. The feature encoder of the pre-trained Wav2vec model and the feed-forward neural network architecture are described, along with the training process. You can use the Wav2vec model implementation from the Hugging Face Transformers library and build the rest of the pipeline around it.

In summary, the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is not directly available from the provided context. It is suggested to contact the authors for more information or implement the pipeline using the details provided in the context.
