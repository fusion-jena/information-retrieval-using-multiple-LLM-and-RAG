Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into subsets such as training, testing, and validation. The text discusses the use of GEDI (Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation) data, Sentinel-2 data, and field data for evaluating model performance, but it does not mention any specific data splitting criteria.

In general, there are various strategies for splitting data in machine learning, including:

1. Holdout method: This involves randomly splitting the data into a training set and a test set. The model is trained using the training set, and the performance is evaluated using the test set.
2. Cross-validation: This method involves dividing the data into k subsets or folds. The model is trained k times, each time leaving out one fold as a validation set. The performance is then averaged over the k runs.
3. Stratified sampling: When dealing with imbalanced classes, it's essential to ensure that each subset has a similar distribution of classes. Stratified sampling ensures that each fold has a similar percentage of samples from each class.
4. Time-series split: In time-series data, it's crucial to maintain the temporal order of the data. In this case, the data is split based on time, using the earliest data for training and the latest data for testing.

The choice of data splitting strategy depends on the specific problem, dataset, and model. In the context of the provided text, without further information, it's not possible to determine which strategy was used for splitting the data.
