Answer:::

The text provided does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that two major ground-based systems, stationary TLS and mobile laser scanning (MLS), were used for data collection in a study related to ecological informatics. Additionally, a modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset of handwritten digits was used to train some of the models.

Stationary TLS (Terrestrial Laser Scanning) is a method of data collection that uses a laser scanner mounted on a tripod to measure the distance between the scanner and the target object. This method is often used in surveying and engineering applications to create detailed 3D models of buildings, landscapes, and other structures.

Mobile laser scanning (MLS), on the other hand, is a method of data collection that uses a laser scanner mounted on a moving vehicle to collect data while the vehicle is in motion. This method is often used in mapping and transportation applications to create detailed 3D models of roads, highways, and other infrastructure.

The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training image recognition models. The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, and each image is labeled with the digit it represents.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline in this study was collected using a combination of stationary TLS, mobile laser scanning, and public datasets such as the MNIST dataset.
