Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as determining the train, test, and validation sets, are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it does mention the sampling strategies and methods used for collecting data in the study related to land use and land cover (LULC) changes in the Amazon forest.

The authors rely on Chuvieco (2020), who suggests that at least 196 test points should be considered for categorical variables. They also take into account Congalton (1991) and Hay (1979), who recommend having at least 50 pixels per thematic class. In this study, instead of strictly distributing 196 training areas among the 6 thematic classes, they chose to include pure training areas that should contain at least 50 pixels in total and prominently represent the class of interest. This distribution was carried out through simplified random sampling, allowing them to effectively capture variability within each class and improve the model's performance.

The context also provides information about the spectral indices calculated for each collection, such as NDVI, EVI, SAVI, BSI, MNDWI, and NDMI. These indices are likely used as features in the model, but the splitting criteria for the data are not specified.

In summary, while the context provides details about the data collection, sampling strategies, and spectral indices, it does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation).
