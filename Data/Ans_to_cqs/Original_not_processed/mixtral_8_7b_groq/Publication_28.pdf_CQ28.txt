Based on the provided context, there is no clear information that specifies the platform used to deploy the deep learning model for satellite image classification. The sources mention various methods and techniques for satellite image classification using deep learning, such as the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a graph neural network, as well as the application of the krill herd algorithm for functions optimization. However, they do not specify the platform used for deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
