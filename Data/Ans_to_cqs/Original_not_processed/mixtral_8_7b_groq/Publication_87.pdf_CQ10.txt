Answer:::
Unfortunately, there is no direct link to a code repository provided in the given context. However, the text mentions that the study is reproducible and includes a deep learning workflow for species identification on camera trap images. It is suggested that the workflow is implemented in R, based on the functions and R packages used in the text. It also mentions the use of a specific R package, "cnn_learner", which is likely a custom or third-party package for deep learning.

To reproduce the study, one would need to create a similar R environment, install the necessary packages, and implement the workflow based on the descriptions provided in the text. The text includes code snippets for model training, data preparation, and prediction, which can serve as a starting point for replication.

It is possible that the authors have made the code repository available on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. In that case, further investigation would be required to locate the code.
