Based on the provided context, the study does not involve a deep learning pipeline or any of the commonly used image datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the study focuses on predicting the distribution of a specific study species using an ensemble modeling approach in the BIOMOD2 package in R.

The dataset used in this study includes a suite of raster layers representing potentially essential variables based on species ecology. These variables include seven bioclimatic variables from the WORLDCLIM database, Digital Elevation Model from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, and distance-to-rivers, distance-to-streams, distance-to-roads, and distance-to-human settlements from the Iranian Forests, Range, and Watershed Management Organization. The distance-to variables were calculated using the Euclidean distance tool in the Spatial Analyst extension in ArcGIS v10.2.

The study used a map of the network of protected areas developed by the Department of Environment in Iran to evaluate the model's performance. The model accuracy was tested using cross-validation, where 70% of the dataset was used as training data to build the models, and the other 30% was used as testing data to calculate the models' accuracy. The Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) was used as the index to specify the accuracy of the models.

Therefore, the datasets used in this study are related to species distribution modeling and are not the commonly used image datasets in deep learning pipelines.
