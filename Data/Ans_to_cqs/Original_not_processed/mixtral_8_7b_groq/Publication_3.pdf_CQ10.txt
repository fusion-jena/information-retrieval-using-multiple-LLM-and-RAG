Answer:

The provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text mentions TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework, but it does not specify where the code for the frog species identification project is located. The authors do not mention any repository link in the context, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

For researchers interested in replicating or building upon the study, it would be helpful to have access to the code. However, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the code repository link. If the authors have made the code publicly available, they may have published it separately from the article or mentioned it in the references.

In summary, the answer to the query is: the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study.
