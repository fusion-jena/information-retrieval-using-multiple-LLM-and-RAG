Answer:::

The provided context discusses a deep learning pipeline that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for salmon scale image analysis, but it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used. However, based on the common practices in deep learning for computer vision tasks, we can infer some possible data annotation techniques that might have been used in this pipeline.

One common annotation technique for object detection tasks is bounding box annotation. This involves drawing a bounding box around the object of interest in an image. The CNN can then learn to detect the object based on the features within the bounding box. For the salmon scale image dataset, bounding box annotation could be used to mark the region of the image containing the salmon scale.

Another annotation technique that could be used for more fine-grained analysis is instance segmentation. This involves not only detecting the object but also segmenting it from the background and other objects in the image. Each pixel in the image is labeled with the class of the object it belongs to. For the salmon scale image dataset, instance segmentation could be used to differentiate between the salmon scale and other structures in the image, providing more detailed information for the CNN to learn from.

The provided context mentions the use of the EfficientNet CNN architecture, which is a pre-trained network with weights trained on the ImageNet dataset. ImageNet is a large-scale dataset of natural images that includes various annotation techniques, such as object detection, image classification, and bounding box annotation. Therefore, it is possible that the EfficientNet network weights were pre-trained on a dataset that included these annotation techniques.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used for the salmon scale image dataset, it is likely that bounding box annotation or instance segmentation were used based on common practices in deep learning for computer vision tasks. Additionally, the pre-trained EfficientNet network weights may have been trained on a dataset that included these annotation techniques.
