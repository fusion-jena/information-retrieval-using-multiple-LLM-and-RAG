Answer:::

The text provided does not give specific details about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for training the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for plant species identification. However, it is mentioned that deep CNN networks require very large amounts of training data for optimization.

In general, optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for training CNNs. These optimization algorithms are used to minimize the loss function and update the weights and biases of the neural network during training.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the weights and biases of the neural network by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases for each training example. However, SGD can be slow to converge and may get stuck in local minima.

Adam is an optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of SGD and other optimization algorithms such as Adagrad and RMSprop. Adam uses the moving averages of the gradient and squared gradient to adapt the learning rate for each parameter. This allows Adam to converge faster and more reliably than SGD.

RMSprop is an optimization algorithm that uses the moving averages of the squared gradient to adapt the learning rate for each parameter. This allows RMSprop to converge faster than SGD for problems with non-stationary or sparse gradients.

Adagrad is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradient information. This allows Adagrad to perform well for problems with non-stationary or sparse gradients.

In summary, while the provided text does not give specific details about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for training CNNs for plant species identification, optimization algorithms such as SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for training CNNs.
