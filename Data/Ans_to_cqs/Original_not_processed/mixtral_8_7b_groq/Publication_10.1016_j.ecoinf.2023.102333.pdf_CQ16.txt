Answer:::

The pieces of context provided suggest that there are several criteria that can be used to determine when training of a machine learning model, such as a Deep Neural Network (DNN), is complete. One such criterion is the validation loss plateau.

In the context provided, it is mentioned that learning and loss curves were used to diagnose the learning performance of the models over time. The training loss curve shows the model's performance on the training data when the optimization algorithm adjusts the model parameters to minimize the loss function. The validation loss curve, on the other hand, measures the model's performance on new unseen data.

The validation loss curve can be used to determine when training is complete by looking for a plateau in the curve. A plateau in the validation loss curve indicates that the model's performance on new unseen data is not improving despite further training. This can be an indication that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data and that further training is unlikely to improve the model's performance on new data.

Another criterion that can be used to determine when training is complete is the number of epochs. An epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset. In the context provided, it is mentioned that the three main DNN models were trained for 200 epochs. The model with the best accuracy was retained after training.

Additionally, adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate, dropout rate, etc. can also be used to determine when training is complete. Hyperparameters are adjustable parameters that control network architecture, optimization procedure, and regularization. Optimizing model hyperparameters remains imperative for leveraging the full potential of the model.

In summary, the pieces of context provided suggest that the criteria used to determine when training is complete include a plateau in the validation loss curve, the number of epochs, and adjusting hyperparameters.
