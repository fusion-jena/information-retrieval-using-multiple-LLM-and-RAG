The provided context does not contain specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model in the study by Chalmers, C., Fergus, P., Wich, S., and Longmore, S.N. (2021). However, it is mentioned that they used deep learning for modeling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring. Deep learning models typically require substantial computational resources, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), to handle large datasets and perform complex computations efficiently.

For instance, the study by Wilson, A.M., Boyle, K.S., Gilmore, J.L., Kiefer, C.J., and Walker, M.F. (2022) used GPUs for processing drone-recorded bird songs. They mentioned that they used a GPU-enabled Python library, TensorFlow, for their analysis. However, this study does not involve deep learning or the specific model used in the Chalmers et al. (2021) study.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model in the Chalmers et al. (2021) study, it is common practice to use GPUs or TPUs for deep learning tasks due to their computational efficiency.
