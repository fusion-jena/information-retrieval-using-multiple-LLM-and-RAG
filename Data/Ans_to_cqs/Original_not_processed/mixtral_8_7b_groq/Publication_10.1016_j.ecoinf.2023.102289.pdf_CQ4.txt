Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text mainly focuses on the description of LaDeco, a semantic segmentation method for landscape image analysis, and the computational efficiency of the model.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to use data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's generalization ability. Therefore, it is possible that these techniques were applied in this study, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.

In summary, while data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning, there is no explicit information in the provided context about the specific techniques used in this study.
