Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized, such as through grid search, random search, or other optimization techniques. The text discusses the performance of various models in terms of parameters, training and inference times, and computational complexity, but it does not mention the specific methods used for hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
