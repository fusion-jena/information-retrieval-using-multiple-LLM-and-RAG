Answer: The performance of a deep learning model is evaluated using various metrics derived from the relative numbers of True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Negatives (FN), and False Positives (FP). In the context provided, the performance metrics used are accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Accuracy is the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances. However, it may not be reliable when classes are imbalanced. Precision, on the other hand, is the ratio of correctly predicted positive instances to the total positive instances. Recall, also known as sensitivity, indicates the number of positive instances that are classified correctly. It is defined as the ratio of True Positives to the sum of True Positives and False Negatives. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.

In multi-class classification, macro and weighted measures of the performance metrics are reported to understand the model's performance better. Macro metrics calculate the metric for each class and then take the average, while weighted metrics consider the number of occurrences of each class in the dataset.

In summary, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are the performance metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model. These metrics are calculated based on the relative numbers of True Positives, True Negatives, False Negatives, and False Positives. Macro and weighted measures are considered in multi-class classification to understand the model's performance better.
