The provided context discusses the use of machine learning algorithms, including deep neural networks, for estimating leaf parameters in vegetation. However, it does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I will provide a general explanation of some common regularization methods.

Regularization methods are essential in machine learning, particularly in deep learning, to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization introduces a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are L2 regularization and dropout.

1. L2 regularization: This method adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This penalty term discourages large weight values, which in turn reduces the complexity of the model and helps prevent overfitting. Mathematically, L2 regularization can be represented as:

Loss = Loss\_function + λ * (sum of squares of all weights)

where λ is the regularization parameter that controls the strength of the penalty term.

2. Dropout: This method randomly sets a fraction of the model's outputs to zero during training. This forces the model to learn redundant representations, which improves its generalization ability and helps prevent overfitting. Dropout is typically applied to the outputs of hidden layers in a neural network.

In summary, L2 regularization and dropout are two common regularization methods used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that discourages large weight values, while dropout randomly sets a fraction of the model's outputs to zero during training, forcing the model to learn redundant representations.
