Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study titled "Deep learning based data-driven model for detecting time-delay water quality indicators of wastewater treatment plant influent" by Zhang et al., 2023. The study was published in the Chemical Engineering Journal and focuses on developing a deep learning model for predicting water quality indicators in wastewater treatment plants. Although the study mentions using deep learning techniques, there is no information about the code repository or the tools used for implementation.

Additionally, the other context provided does not mention any code repository related to the study of soil heat flux estimation using ensemble machine learning techniques. The study titled "Ensemble machine learning for interpretable soil heat flux estimation" by Cross and Drewry, 2024, was published in the Ecological Informatics journal and focuses on developing an interpretable machine learning model for estimating soil heat flux using remote sensing data. However, there is no information available about the code repository or the tools used for implementation.

Therefore, I cannot provide the code repository location for the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Zhang et al., 2023.
