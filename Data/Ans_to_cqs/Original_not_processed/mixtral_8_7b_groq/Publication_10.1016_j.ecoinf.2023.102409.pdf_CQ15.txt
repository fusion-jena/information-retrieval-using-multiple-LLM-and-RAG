Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in the context provided utilizes the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer. This information is disclosed in the specification of the model’s configuration, where it is stated that the model utilized the SGD optimizer (Yuan et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2023c). 

The SGD optimizer is a popular choice in deep learning tasks due to its effectiveness and simplicity. It iteratively updates the model's parameters by computing the gradient of the loss function for a single training example, rather than the entire dataset, which is where the term 'stochastic' originates. This approach makes SGD computationally efficient and suitable for large-scale machine learning tasks.

However, the text does not mention the use of other optimization techniques such as Adam, RMSprop, or Adagrad. It is important to note that the choice of optimizer can significantly influence the training dynamics and the final performance of the model. Therefore, it is common practice to experiment with different optimizers and learning rate schedules to find the best combination for a specific task.
