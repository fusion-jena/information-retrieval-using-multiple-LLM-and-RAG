Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or a code repository for it. The text discusses a study related to carbon emissions in Xi'an, China, and provides details about the data sources and methods used in the study. However, it does not mention any deep learning pipeline or a code repository for it on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline.
