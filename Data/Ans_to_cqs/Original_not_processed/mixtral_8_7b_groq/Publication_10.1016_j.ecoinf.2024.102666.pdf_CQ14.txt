Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text mentions the use of various atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms, but it does not discuss the specific methods used for hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search or random search.

However, the context does mention that the study evaluates the performance of different AC algorithms using certain indices, which provide a quantitative assessment of the algorithms' accuracy. This suggests that the researchers likely employed some form of model validation and comparison, which often involves hyperparameter tuning to optimize each model's performance.

In general, hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in building machine learning models, as it helps to find the best set of parameters for a given algorithm and dataset. Grid search and random search are two common methods for hyperparameter tuning. Grid search involves systematically testing all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a specified range, while random search selects a subset of these combinations at random. Both methods aim to find the set of hyperparameters that yield the best model performance.

Without more specific information from the provided context, it is impossible to give a definitive answer on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, considering the general practices in machine learning model development, it is reasonable to assume that some form of hyperparameter tuning was performed during the study.
