Answer:::

The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with some transformer components. The primary model is the EfficientNetV2 series, which is a type of CNN. Specifically, it uses the MBConv block from the EfficientNetV1 series, which is a linear bottleneck layer with inverted residuals and depth-wise separable convolutions. This block enables the feature extraction network to focus on important information features and distinguish them from the background while improving efficiency and reducing memory requirements.

Moreover, the pipeline incorporates a transformer structure called the bottleneck transformer, which is used to replace some of the spatial convolutions in ResNet's last three bottleneck blocks with multi-head self-attention. This integration of self-attention and convolution reduces the network depth and improves the model's performance.

In summary, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is primarily a CNN (EfficientNetV2), but it also includes transformer components (bottleneck transformer) to enhance performance.
