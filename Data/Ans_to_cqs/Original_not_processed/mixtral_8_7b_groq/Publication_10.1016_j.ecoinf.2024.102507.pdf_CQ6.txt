Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are no explicit details mentioned regarding the data preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that data preparation involves preparing the ground truth images and extracting training samples.

Nonetheless, it is important to note that data preprocessing is a crucial step in deep learning model development. Common data preprocessing steps include:

1. Data cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant or corrupted data that may affect the model's performance.
2. Data normalization: This is the process of scaling numerical data to a common range to prevent any feature from having a disproportionate impact on the model.
3. Data augmentation: This is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to the existing data.
4. Data splitting: This involves dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

In the context provided, data augmentation was used in the form of flattened convolution kernels, which helped achieve optimal simulation results. Therefore, it can be inferred that data augmentation was one of the preprocessing steps used in this study.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit details on the data preprocessing steps, it is mentioned that data preparation is carried out. Based on best practices in deep learning model development, it is recommended to include data cleaning, normalization, augmentation, and splitting as part of the data preprocessing pipeline.
