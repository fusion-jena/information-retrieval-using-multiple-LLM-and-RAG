Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about using validation loss plateau or any other specific criteria to determine when the training is complete in the described process. Instead, the training process is repeated until convergence or a stopping point is reached.

The training process mentioned in the context involves an expectation-maximization process based on a random walk with a fixed number of steps. During this process, the maximization step uses the imputations from the current step to realign the conditional probabilities in the network from the data. This process is repeated until there is no change or a stopping point is reached. The final ten steps of this process are used to check for stability, and the outcome would have the same number of clusters for all ten final steps.

Additionally, the contingency table fit (CTF) is used as a network performance indicator, representing the quality of the fit to the data. The CTF is extracted for the individual taxa factor networks as well as the meta-factor network. However, the context does not mention using CTF as a criterion to determine when the training is complete.

In summary, based on the provided context, there is no information about using validation loss plateau or any other specific criteria to determine when the training is complete. Instead, the training process is repeated until convergence or a stopping point is reached.
