Answer:::

The text provided does not give specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that they used a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation for model training. These techniques often require substantial computational power, which is typically provided by Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Therefore, it can be inferred that either GPUs or TPUs were used for training, but the specific type of hardware is not mentioned in the text.
