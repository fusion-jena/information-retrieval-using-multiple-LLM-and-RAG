Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, the text does mention that different parameters and settings were used for the Ecological Source Analysis (ESA) in three separate cases. These parameters include the initial population and the minimum fitness value. It can be inferred that the training for each case was completed when the ESA was performed using the specified settings.

In machine learning and optimization processes, it is common to use validation loss plateaus or convergence of the optimization algorithm as criteria to determine when training is complete. However, the context provided here does not contain enough information to determine if these specific criteria were used.

In summary, while the provided context does not give a clear answer to the query, it can be inferred that the training was completed when the specified parameters were used for the ESA in each of the three cases. The criteria for determining training completion, such as a validation loss plateau, are not explicitly mentioned in the text.
