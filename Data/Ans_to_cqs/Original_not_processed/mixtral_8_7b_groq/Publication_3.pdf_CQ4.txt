Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that they used a transfer learning technique with the Inception v3 model, which is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow. This model is trained on over 1 million images from the ImageNet database, which suggests that some form of data augmentation was used during the training of the Inception v3 model.

Inception v3 is a CNN that consists of 48 layers, and it is widely recognized for outperforming other models in image classification tasks. Inception v3 uses several techniques to reduce the computational cost and prevent overfitting, such as aggressive regularization, factorized convolutions, and auxiliary classifiers. One of the techniques that Inception v3 uses to prevent overfitting and increase the diversity of the training data is data augmentation.

Common data augmentation techniques for image classification tasks include flipping, rotating, and scaling. Flipping refers to horizontally or vertically flipping the images in the training set. Rotating refers to rotating the images by a certain angle. Scaling refers to changing the size of the images. These techniques help to increase the size of the training set, reduce overfitting, and improve the generalization of the model.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that some form of data augmentation, such as flipping, rotating, and scaling, was used during the training of the Inception v3 model.
