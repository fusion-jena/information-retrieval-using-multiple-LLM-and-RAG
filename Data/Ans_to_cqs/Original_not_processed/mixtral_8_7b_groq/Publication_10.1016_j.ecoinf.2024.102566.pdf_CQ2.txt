Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in the study by J. Chang and C. Huang appears to use remote sensing imagery and forest inventory data for biomass estimation.

The remote sensing imagery is likely provided in a raster format, as the study mentions converting vector polygon data into 1 km Ã— 1 km grids to match the biomass estimation. Raster data is a grid of cells where each cell contains a value representing information such as elevation, temperature, or land cover type. In this case, the raster data may represent land cover type or biomass density.

The forest inventory data is likely provided in a tabular format such as CSV, as the study mentions employing a method with low data dependency that integrates forest inventory data with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation. Forest inventory data typically includes information on tree species, diameter at breast height, and tree height, among other variables.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in this study uses raster format remote sensing imagery and tabular format forest inventory data.
