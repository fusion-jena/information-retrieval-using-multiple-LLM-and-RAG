Answer:::

The type of deep learning models used in the pipeline mentioned in the given context are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers. 

The CNN-based models include DenseNet-161 and ResNet-50, which are commonly used ConvNets in computer vision tasks. The RNN-based model is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that some form of RNN or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network might be used for sequential data processing. 

Moreover, the paper uses Vision Transformers (ViT), a type of Transformer model initially introduced for image classification tasks. Specifically, the authors use ViT-S/16, ViT-B/16, and ViT-L/16 variants. These Transformer models are adapted from the BERT approach for language understanding and are used for birdsong classification.

In summary, the deep learning models used in the pipeline are DenseNet-161 and ResNet-50 (CNNs), possibly some form of RNN for sequential data processing, and Vision Transformers (ViT) for birdsong classification.
