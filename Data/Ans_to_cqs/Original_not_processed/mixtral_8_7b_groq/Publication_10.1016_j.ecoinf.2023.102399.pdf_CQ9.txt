Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used for fish biomass estimation. The article "Fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on deep neural network" provides details about the development of a deep learning technique for fish biomass estimation, but it does not mention where the data repository is located.

The article does mention that the authors used underwater stereo images of fish, and they developed a deep learning model to estimate the biomass of the fish by detecting and identifying the head and mouth of the fish in the images. They also combined computer vision with deep learning to improve the accuracy of the biomass estimation.

However, the article does not provide information about the data repository or the availability of the dataset used in the study. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.

In general, researchers who publish articles that use datasets or code repositories are encouraged to make them available to other researchers to promote transparency and reproducibility. Data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF are commonly used for sharing datasets and code repositories.

If the authors of the article have made the dataset or code repository available, it is likely that they would have mentioned it in the article or provided a link to it in the article or in the supplementary materials. However, in this case, there is no such information available in the provided context.
