Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated which measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that suggest that some steps were taken to ensure the model's ability to perform well on unseen data.

Firstly, the model was trained and tested on a large and diverse dataset of humpback whale sounds. The dataset consisted of 3900 images, which were obtained from a two-second window size and 90 dpi for the transfer learning approach. The diversity of the dataset can help the model to learn a wide range of features and patterns, which can improve its ability to generalize to new data.

Secondly, the model selection process was based on the best validation accuracy and precision obtained during training. This suggests that the model was evaluated on a separate validation set, which is a good practice to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data.

Thirdly, the model training and prediction procedures were executed on a powerful computing platform, namely Microsoft Azure using instance NV12s v3 with 12 vCPUs and 112 GB RAM. This allowed the model to be trained and tested on large datasets, which can help to reduce the risk of overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize.

Finally, the algorithm scripts are available in Supporting Information B, which suggests that the model development process was transparent and reproducible. This can help other researchers to replicate the study and build upon the work, which can further improve the model's generalizability.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly state which measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, there are some indications that suggest that the model was trained and tested on a large and diverse dataset, evaluated on a separate validation set, trained and tested on a powerful computing platform, and developed in a transparent and reproducible manner. These steps can help to ensure the model's ability to perform well on unseen data.
