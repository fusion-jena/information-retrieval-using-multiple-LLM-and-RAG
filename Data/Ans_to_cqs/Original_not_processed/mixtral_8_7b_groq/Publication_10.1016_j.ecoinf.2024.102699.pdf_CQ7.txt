Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about how the data was split for training, validating, and testing the deep learning models. However, it is common in machine learning and deep learning to split the data into three subsets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to train the model, i.e., to adjust the model's parameters to minimize the error on the training data. The validation set is used during the training process to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and performs poorly on unseen data. The validation set helps to assess the model's performance on unseen data and choose the best model.

Once the training and validation processes are complete, the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. The testing set is independent of the training and validation sets and provides an unbiased estimate of the model's generalization ability.

The splitting of the data into these subsets can be done randomly or following a specific strategy. For example, in classification problems, it is common to split the data so that each subset has a similar distribution of classes. This ensures that the model is trained and evaluated on a diverse set of data.

In the context of the study, the authors used the BirdCLEF challenge dataset, which might have come with a predefined split for training, validation, and testing. However, the provided context does not give information about the data split.
