Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipelines for Hyperspectral Image (HSI) classification. However, it mentions that the deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable results on HSI classification tasks, and several studies have been conducted to improve the classification accuracy.

The studies mentioned in the context have used three data sets for HSI classification, but the names of the data sets are not provided. Study [5] achieved the best classification performances on two data sets, while study [6] made a success on three data sets. Study [7] proposed a new architecture that integrates spectral and spatial features and achieved high classification accuracies on three data sets. Study [8] proposed a 3-D deep learning framework that achieved the highest classification accuracy on three data sets. Study [9] designed a novel CNN architecture for HSI classification and achieved high classification accuracies on three data sets.

Therefore, while the specific names of the data sets used in the deep learning pipelines for HSI classification are not provided in the context, it is clear that several data sets have been used across different studies to evaluate the performance of deep learning-based methods for HSI classification.
