Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context focuses on marine bioclimatic modeling using Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and ecological niche analysis. It mentions the use of various databases for model validation and the evaluation of model performance using metrics such as AUC and TSS. However, it does not mention the use of hardware resources like GPUs or TPUs for deep learning model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
