Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

1. Learning Rate: The learning rate is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is known that Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) was used as the model's optimizer. The learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter in SGD, and it determines the size of the steps that the model takes while learning. The learning rate was likely set to a value that ensures optimal learning while preventing overshooting or undershooting the optimal solution.

2. Optimizer: The optimizer used in the deep learning model is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). SGD is a popular optimization algorithm that is commonly used in deep learning models. It works by iteratively adjusting the model's weights in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function.

3. Momentum: The momentum value used in the SGD optimizer is 0.9. Momentum is a hyperparameter that helps the optimizer to overcome local minima by adding a fraction of the previous weight update to the current weight update. A momentum value of 0.9 means that 90% of the previous weight update will be added to the current weight update.

4. Batch Size: The batch size used in the deep learning model is 16. The batch size determines the number of samples that the model sees before updating its weights. A larger batch size can lead to more stable learning, but it can also increase the risk of overfitting. A smaller batch size can lead to more robust learning, but it can also increase the risk of underfitting.

5. Epochs: The deep learning model was trained for 150 epochs. An epoch is a complete pass through the training dataset. Training for more epochs can lead to better learning, but it can also increase the risk of overfitting.

6. Data Augmentation: The default data augmentation techniques of YOLOv5 were applied during training. Data augmentation is a technique that is used to increase the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the training samples. Data augmentation can help to improve the model's robustness and prevent overfitting.

7. Positive and Negative Predictions: Predicted bounding boxes with an intersection-over-union (IoU) of 0.6 or higher were considered positive, while bounding boxes with an IoU of less than 0.6 were considered negative. The threshold value of 0.6 was used to determine whether a predicted bounding box is a true positive or a false positive.

In summary, the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include the learning rate (which is not explicitly mentioned), the optimizer (SGD), the momentum (0.9), the batch size (16), the number of epochs (150), the data augmentation techniques (YOLOv5 default), and the positive and negative prediction threshold (IoU of 0.6).
