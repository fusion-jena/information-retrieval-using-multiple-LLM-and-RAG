The deep learning pipeline in the study mentioned does not provide explicit information on the specific data formats used. However, based on the context given, we can infer that the following data formats are likely to have been used:

1. Raster data (image) - PlanetScope multi-spectral satellite imagery is used in the study, which is a type of raster data. These images are used to derive spectral indices related to vegetation and water content.
2. Vector data (topographic data) - Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is used in the study, which is a type of vector data. This data provides high-resolution topographic information, including slope, aspect, and Topographic Wetness Index (TWI).

It is also possible that other data formats, such as CSV or text files, were used to store tabular data, such as the parameters of the ALS data or the results of the analysis. However, the context provided does not explicitly mention the use of these data formats.

Therefore, based on the given context, it can be concluded that raster and vector data formats are likely to have been used in the deep learning pipeline.
