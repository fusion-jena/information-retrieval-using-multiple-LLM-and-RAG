Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively answer this question.

The text focuses on the methodology and process of using a deep neural network for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification, including the architecture of the convolutional neural network and the training process. However, there is no information about the specific cloud platform or local machine used for deployment.

So, we cannot say for sure whether the model was deployed on AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other platform.
