The provided context does not give specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does provide some information about the data processing and classification stage of the research, which could indirectly relate to the model's generalizability.

In the data processing and classification stage, the researchers used Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 data from 1995, 2008, and 2020, which could be seen as a form of diverse dataset. The data was obtained from the USGS Earth Explorer (<https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/>) and OpenStreetMap (www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/21.84/82.79), which could provide a variety of features and information for the model to learn from.

Additionally, the accuracy assessment for LULC (Land Use/Land Cover) classification was provided in Table 2. The overall accuracy and kappa statistics (KIA) were calculated for each year, which could indicate the model's ability to perform well on unseen data. However, the context does not explicitly mention any techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting that were used to further ensure the model's generalizability.

In summary, while the provided context suggests that a diverse dataset was used and accuracy assessment was performed, it does not provide enough information to definitively answer the query about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
