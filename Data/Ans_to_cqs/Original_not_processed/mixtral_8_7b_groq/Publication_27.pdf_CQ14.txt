The specific method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model is not provided in the context. However, there are some indications of techniques that might have been used based on the tools and libraries mentioned.

The context includes references to scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library for Python, which provides various methods for hyperparameter tuning such as GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV. Grid search performs an exhaustive search over specified parameter values, while random search builds a randomly generated set of parameter combinations and selects the best one.

Furthermore, there are also references to Keras and TensorFlow, deep learning frameworks that can be used for model building. These frameworks also provide tools for hyperparameter tuning, such as Keras Tuner, which allows for various strategies such as random search, Bayesian optimization, and Hyperband.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the hyperparameters of the model were likely optimized using one of the aforementioned methods, such as grid search or random search, possibly using scikit-learn, Keras, or TensorFlow. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
