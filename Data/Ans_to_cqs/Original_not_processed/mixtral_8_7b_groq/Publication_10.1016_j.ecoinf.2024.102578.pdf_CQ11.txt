Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly given. The text mentions that the original pictures and data from Finnmark and Yamal can be obtained from the authors upon request, and the code and detailed instructions for the workflow can be found on GitHub at <https://github.com/gerlis22/CameraTrap.git>. However, there is no link to a formal data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
