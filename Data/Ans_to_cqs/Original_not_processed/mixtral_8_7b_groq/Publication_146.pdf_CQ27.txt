Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does offer some insights that can help us infer the possible steps taken.

Firstly, the model was trained using the YoloV3 architecture, and the training was conducted on a NVIDIA Quadro M4000 GPU. This suggests that the training and deployment could be part of a GPU-enabled cloud service, such as Google Colab or AWS SageMaker, which provide GPU-powered environments for training and deploying machine learning models.

Secondly, the context mentions model serialization, stating that "the model quickly reached F1 and mAP scores of ~0.4, whereafter they continue to increase but at a slower rate. At the end of the training, the model achieved the accuracy scores of F1 = 0.530 and mAP = 0.557." This implies that the model's state was saved at various stages during training, allowing for model versioning and selective loading of a trained model. Model serialization is a common practice in deep learning, where models are saved in a format that can be later loaded and used for inference. Popular serialization formats include TensorFlow's SavedModel, PyTorch's torch.save, and ONNX's model format.

Thirdly, the choice of the Adam learning rate optimizer indicates that the training process might have utilized a framework or library that supports adaptive learning rate algorithms. This could suggest that the same framework or library was used for deployment, leveraging its built-in capabilities for serving the model.

Lastly, the context does not mention any specific platform or technology for deploying the model. However, given the popularity of cloud-based solutions for deep learning model deployment, it is plausible that a cloud service was used. Common cloud-based deep learning deployment platforms include TensorFlow Serving, AWS SageMaker, and Azure Machine Learning.

In conclusion, while the context does not provide explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it suggests that the model was likely serialized, and the training framework or library might have been used for deployment. The choice of GPU-enabled training and the Adam optimizer also implies that a cloud-based solution could have been utilized for deployment.
