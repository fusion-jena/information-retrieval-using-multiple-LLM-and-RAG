Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not contain information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context focuses on the methodology and results of a study that analyzed wild bird species in YouTube videos. It includes details about the data collection process, such as the keyword used, the number of views and subscribers, and the bird species identified. However, there is no mention of the code repository or the deep learning pipeline used in the study. I recommend reaching out to the authors or the publication directly for more information.
