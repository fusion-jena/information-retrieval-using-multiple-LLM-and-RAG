Answer:::

The trained deep learning model was deployed in a cloud-based system following a series of steps. Firstly, the model was custom trained with an attention layer and different epoch values (100, 150, 200, and 250) to ensure accurate training results and prevent overfitting. The training summary for each epoch was presented in Tables 5, 6, and 7, and the trends of mAP values with increasing epochs were shown in Figs. 14 and 15. The dataset used for custom training was sufficiently large, and the DL model was tuned with optimized hyperparameters.

Once the training was complete, the model was serialized, which is the process of converting the model into a format that can be stored and loaded again. Serialization is essential for deploying deep learning models as it allows the model to be saved and loaded onto different platforms.

After serialization, the model was deployed onto a cloud-based system with specific computing infrastructure. The cloud computing infrastructure used for the deployment of the system included a processor equivalent to intel core i9 7980XE @ 2.60 GHz, Tesla T4 GPU, bandwidth of 1Gbps, storage of 100GB, maximum latency of 50 ms, secured wireless connectivity of WPA3, and cloud features such as scalability, resource pooling, and security.

The trained model was then hosted and run on the cloud-based system, and cloud-resident cameras were placed in the Kohora range of KNP. The images captured by the camera were fed into the model for object detection. The confusion matrix, F1 curve, P curve, PR curve, R curve, and final training plots were shown for the training of the model with an attention layer with epoch-150.

Therefore, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model included custom training, serialization, and deployment onto a cloud-based system with specific computing infrastructure.
