Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions that a specific dataset was built for cactus recognition in aerial images, and it suggests ways to extend this dataset to improve accuracy. However, it does not mention where or how this dataset is shared with other researchers. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query. It would be helpful for the authors to include information about data availability and access in their publications to promote transparency and reproducibility of their research.
