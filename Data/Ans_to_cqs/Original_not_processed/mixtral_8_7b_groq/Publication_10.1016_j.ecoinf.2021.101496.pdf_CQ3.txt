The provided context does not contain information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide a general answer to the query.

Data annotation is an essential step in the deep learning pipeline, especially for computer vision tasks. It involves labeling data, such as images or videos, with relevant information that can be used to train machine learning models.

There are several data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, including:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a box around an object of interest in an image. The box contains the object, and its coordinates are used as labels to train the model. This technique is commonly used for object detection tasks.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image to indicate the object it belongs to. It is a more detailed form of annotation than bounding box annotation and is commonly used for semantic segmentation tasks.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class label. It is used to classify objects in an image based on their semantic meaning.
4. Landmark annotation: This technique involves identifying and labeling key points or landmarks on an object in an image. It is commonly used for facial recognition or pose estimation tasks.
5. Scene segmentation: This technique involves dividing an image into different regions or segments based on their visual characteristics. It is used for scene understanding tasks.

These annotation techniques are used to create labeled datasets that can be used to train deep learning models. The models learn to recognize patterns in the labeled data and can then be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.

In summary, data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, landmark annotation, and scene segmentation. These techniques are used to label data with relevant information that can be used to train machine learning models.
