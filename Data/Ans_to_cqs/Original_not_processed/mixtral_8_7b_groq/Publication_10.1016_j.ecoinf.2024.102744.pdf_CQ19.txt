Answer:::
In the experiments conducted for the study, the Python 3.10 programming environment was used along with popular deep learning libraries such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and OpenCV. These frameworks were utilized to build and train the deep learning models employed in the study.

More specifically, the YOLOv5 and the classification network were built using PyTorch, while the Faster RCNN model was developed using TensorFlow. These frameworks provided the necessary tools and functionalities to design, train, and evaluate the deep learning models used in the study.

In addition, other state-of-the-art methods such as EfficientDet, RetinaNet, and DETR were also considered in the study, which were implemented using either TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Therefore, it can be concluded that both PyTorch and TensorFlow were used to build the deep learning models in the study, while OpenCV was used for computer vision tasks.
