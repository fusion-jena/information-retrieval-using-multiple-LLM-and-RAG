The provided context discusses the data preprocessing methods and hyperparameter tuning in the development of a predictive model for oil palm yield. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

The context does mention that the preprocessed data was divided into training (80%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%). While this splitting method does not directly address data bias, it can help ensure that the model's performance is evaluated on a diverse range of data. Stratified sampling, which ensures that each subset (training, validation, or test) has approximately the same percentage of samples of each target class, could be an alternative approach to reduce bias. However, the context does not specify whether stratified sampling was used.

The context also discusses the use of the MinMaxScaler for scaling features and the LabelEncoder for encoding categorical variables. These techniques are primarily used for data preparation and do not directly address data bias.

Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV with cross-validation (cv = 10) was performed to optimize the model's performance. This process involves searching for the best combination of hyperparameters to minimize the model's bias and variance. Although the context does not explicitly mention techniques like oversampling or undersampling, these methods could be employed during cross-validation to address data imbalance and reduce bias.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, it does discuss data splitting, feature scaling, and hyperparameter tuning, which can contribute to reducing bias in the model. However, it is unclear whether stratified sampling, oversampling, or undersampling were employed.
