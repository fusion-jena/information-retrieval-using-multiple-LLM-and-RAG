The context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It mentions that the optimization of parameter values leads to improved results, but it does not specify the method used for this optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question. However, common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves testing all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a specified range, while random search selects a subset of these combinations at random. Bayesian optimization, on the other hand, uses a probabilistic model to make informed decisions about which hyperparameters to test next. Without further information, it is not possible to determine which of these methods was used in this case.
