Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, it does mention the use of structural re-parameterization techniques, which decouple the training structure from the inference structure, enabling independent optimization of the training and reasoning stages. This could potentially impact the postprocessing steps, but the text does not provide specific details about this.

The context does discuss the use of a complete connection layer and a dropout layer as part of a model for classification decisions. The complete connection layer multiplies the output of the previous layer by a weight matrix and performs nonlinear operations using an activation function. Dropout technology is used to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the model. These steps are more related to the model architecture and training process, rather than postprocessing.

In summary, while the provided context discusses various aspects of model training and architecture, it does not explicitly mention specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.
