Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is one specific example of a regularization method used in a deep learning algorithm. In the report from 2023 by Ren, Cao, and Du, they mention the use of a deep learning algorithm for strategic planning. However, they do not explicitly mention which regularization methods were used to prevent overfitting.

However, the context does mention other regularization methods used in machine learning algorithms. For example, Liao et al. (2021) and Mu et al. (2019) used quantitative methods, which may include regularization techniques. Additionally, Yu et al. (2021a) used mixed effects models, which can also include regularization methods.

In general, there are several regularization methods that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 during training, which helps to prevent over-reliance on any one unit and improves generalization. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages smaller weights and helps to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, while the specific regularization methods used in the deep learning algorithm mentioned in the context are not specified, it is likely that one or more of these common regularization techniques were used to prevent overfitting.
