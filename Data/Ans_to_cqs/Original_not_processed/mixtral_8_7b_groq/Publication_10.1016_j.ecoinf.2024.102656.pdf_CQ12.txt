Based on the provided context, there is no information suggesting that a deep learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer, is used in the pipeline. The models mentioned in the context are generalized linear models (GLM), maximum entropy (MaxEnt), random forest (RF), generalized boosting model (GBM), and multivariate adaptive regression lines (MARS). These models are traditional machine learning algorithms, not deep learning models. Deep learning models typically involve multi-layer neural networks and are particularly useful for large, complex datasets. In this case, however, the described models are more suitable for the given study as they focus on ensemble modeling, combining forecasts from multiple statistical models to enhance predictive accuracy and mitigate uncertainties and biases.
