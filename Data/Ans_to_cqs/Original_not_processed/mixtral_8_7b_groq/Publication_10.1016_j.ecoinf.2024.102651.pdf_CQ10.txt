Answer:::
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of ResNet, ViT, and CA-Hybrid networks for image classification tasks, specifically for classifying objects of the Cervidae class. However, it does not mention or provide a link to any code repository related to these models or the deep learning pipeline. I hope this information is helpful, and I apologize for any inconvenience.
