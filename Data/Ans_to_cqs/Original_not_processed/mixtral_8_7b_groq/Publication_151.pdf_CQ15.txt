Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. However, it does mention that a running average of the recent magnitude of the gradient is used to speed up training, which is a technique often used in conjunction with optimization algorithms to stabilize learning and improve convergence. The learning rate is not explicitly stated, but the fact that the loss function is checked every 50 epochs and training is stopped when the loss fails to decrease suggests that some form of early stopping may be in place to prevent overfitting. The specific optimization algorithm used in this pipeline is not clear from the provided context.
