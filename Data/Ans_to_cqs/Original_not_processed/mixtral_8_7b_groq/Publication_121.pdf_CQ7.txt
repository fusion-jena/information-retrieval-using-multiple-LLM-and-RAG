Answer:::

In the context provided, the dataset was split for deep learning model training using a 75:25 ratio, with 5789 images used for training and 1930 images used for testing. However, the criteria or specific method used to split the data is not explicitly mentioned.

There are several common strategies for splitting data in deep learning model training. One approach is to split the data randomly, where each data point has an equal chance of being assigned to the training or testing set. This method can be useful for ensuring that the training and testing sets are representative of the overall population.

Another approach is to split the data based on certain characteristics or features. For example, in a time-series dataset, it may be appropriate to split the data based on time, where the training set consists of data from an earlier time period and the testing set consists of data from a later time period. This method can be useful for evaluating how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.

In some cases, a validation set may also be used in addition to the training and testing sets. The validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and evaluate the model during the training process. The final model is then evaluated on the testing set.

It is important to carefully consider the criteria used to split the data, as it can have a significant impact on the performance of the model. In general, it is best to use a diverse and representative sample for training, and to evaluate the model on a separate, independent set of data.
