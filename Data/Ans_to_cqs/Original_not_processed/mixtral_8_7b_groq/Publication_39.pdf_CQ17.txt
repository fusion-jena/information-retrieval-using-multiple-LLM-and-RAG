Answer:::

The text provided does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization as methods to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe other regularization techniques that are used for this purpose.

To prevent overfitting and generalize better, the authors utilize data augmentation techniques during the training process. Specifically, they use the python library imgaug to apply a combination of augmentation techniques to each frame of the video. These techniques include horizontal flip, adding or subtracting intensity, Gaussian blur, additive Gaussian noise, and Fog. The Fog augmentation is a complex technique that simulates fog in the video, and it is used with a probability of 10%. The other combined augmentation techniques are applied with a probability of 90%.

In addition to data augmentation, the authors use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as an optimization technique. They start with a learning rate of 0.0005, a momentum of 0.9, and weight decay of 0.0005. The learning rate is decreased every 10 epochs by multiplying it with Î³ = 0.1. In the training process, they use warmup iterations for the learning rate with a warmup factor of 1/1000. These parameters gave the best results in their evaluations.

Therefore, while the text does not explicitly mention dropout or L2 regularization, it does describe other regularization techniques that are used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. These techniques include data augmentation and the use of Stochastic Gradient Descent with a learning rate schedule and warmup iterations.
