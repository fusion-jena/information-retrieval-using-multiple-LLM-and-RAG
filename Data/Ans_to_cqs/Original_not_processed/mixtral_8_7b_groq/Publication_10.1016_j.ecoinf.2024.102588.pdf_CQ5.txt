Answer:::
The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for tasks related to aquatic ecosystem health assessment. However, it does mention that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied to estimate variables in aquatic environments such as water quality, streamflow, and algae. Commonly used datasets in deep learning for image recognition tasks include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits, CIFAR consists of natural images, and ImageNet is a large-scale dataset of over 14 million images. It is possible that researchers use these or other datasets specific to aquatic ecosystems for training and testing their deep learning models. Without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
