Answer:::

The pieces of context provided do not directly answer the query regarding the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention the use of various tools and techniques that can be used to collect data for specific applications in the field of food science and fish freshness assessment.

For instance, Wang et al. (2023) used a portable spectrometer to classify the freshness grades of sea bass, salmon, tuna, and beef. Similarly, Moser et al. (2023) evaluated spectral handheld devices for freshness assessment of carp and trout fillets. Kunjulakshmi et al. (2020) developed a portable, non-destructive freshness indicative sensor for Indian Mackerel stored under ice. Ntzimani et al. (2023) studied slurry ice as an alternative cooling medium for fish. Lalabadi et al. (2020) categorized fish freshness from eyes and gills color features using artificial neural network and support vector machines.

Moreover, Jayasundara et al. (2023) used deep learning for automated fish grading. Mokrani et al. (2018) studied the effect of fish farming conditions on European sea bass quality and shelf life during storage in ice. These studies suggest the use of sensors, spectrometers, and other specialized equipment for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for fish freshness assessment.

In addition, there are public datasets available for fish freshness assessment. For example, the Seafood Safety project of the European Union provides a public dataset for fish freshness assessment based on sensory, chemical, and microbiological parameters (<https://www.seafoodsafety.eu/>).

Therefore, it can be inferred that sensors, spectrometers, and other specialized equipment are used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for fish freshness assessment. Additionally, public datasets may also be used for this purpose.
