Answer:

The pieces of context provided do not directly answer the query, but they do offer some insights into the sources of raw data used in deep learning for remote sensing and wildlife population assessment.

In the context of remote sensing, high-resolution satellite imagery is used as raw data for training deep learning models. Laliberte and Ripple (2003) used remotely sensed imagery for automated wildlife counts, while LaRue et al. (2017) assessed the feasibility of using high-resolution satellite imagery to assess vertebrate wildlife populations. Leblanc et al. (2016) studied the spectral reflectance of polar bear and other large arctic mammal pelts, which could be used as raw data for remote sensing surveys.

In terms of data collection methods, surveys and sensors are used to collect raw data. Surveys can be manual or automated, as mentioned by Laliberte and Ripple (2003) in their study on automated wildlife counts. Sensors, particularly satellite sensors, are used to capture high-resolution images of wildlife and their habitats.

Furthermore, public datasets may also be used as raw data in deep learning pipelines. However, the contexts provided do not mention any specific public datasets used in their studies.

In summary, surveys, sensors, and satellite imagery are the methods and sources of raw data utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, specifically in the context of remote sensing and wildlife population assessment.
