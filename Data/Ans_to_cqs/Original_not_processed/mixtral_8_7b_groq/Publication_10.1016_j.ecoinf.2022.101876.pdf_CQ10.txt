Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used for processing wildlife camera trap images. The context mentions several studies and papers that discuss the use of deep learning and machine learning for processing camera trap images, such as the studies by Clune (2018), Norouzzadeh et al. (2021), and Tabak et al. (2019). However, none of the sources provide a direct link to a code repository.

It is possible that the authors of these studies have made their code available on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but the context does not provide enough information to determine this. If you are interested in accessing the code for these studies, I would recommend looking up the papers and contacting the authors directly to inquire about the availability of their code.

In addition, it is worth noting that there are several open-source projects and tools available for processing camera trap images using deep learning, which may be useful for your purposes. For example, the deep learning toolkit "DeepLOP" developed by Schneider et al. (2018) is available on GitHub, and the "Machine Learning for Wildlife Monitoring" project by Tabak et al. (2019) provides code and tutorials for using machine learning to classify animal species in camera trap images.
