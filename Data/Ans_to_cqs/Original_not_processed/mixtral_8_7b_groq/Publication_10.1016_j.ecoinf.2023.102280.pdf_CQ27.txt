Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does provide some insights into the general steps that could have been taken.

Firstly, once the deep learning model is trained, it is typically saved or serialized to disk. This is done so that the model can be loaded and used for inference at a later time without having to retrain the model. The serialized model can be stored in a variety of formats, such as a .h5 file in Keras or a .pth file in PyTorch.

Secondly, the selection of a platform to deploy the model would depend on the specific requirements of the application. For instance, if the application requires real-time processing of audio data, then a high-performance computing platform such as a GPU server would be appropriate. On the other hand, if the application does not require real-time processing, then a less powerful platform such as a CPU server or even a local machine could be used.

Moreover, the context mentions that deep noise reduction methods are commonly applied to natural language processing (NLP) and achieve state-of-the-art performance in sub-real time on limited hardware. This suggests that the trained deep learning model could have been deployed on a limited hardware platform, such as an edge device or a mobile device.

Finally, the context also mentions that collecting clean recordings for generating training data is infeasible in many cases. Therefore, the deployed model would need to be robust enough to handle noisy input data and still produce accurate denoised outputs.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it suggests that the model was likely serialized to disk, and the platform selection would depend on the specific requirements of the application. Additionally, the model would need to be robust enough to handle noisy input data.
