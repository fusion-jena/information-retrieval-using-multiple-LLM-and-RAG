Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model. This model has gained popularity due to its ability to identify features and patterns in large image datasets. It has demonstrated success in object recognition and categorization in various fields. However, its application to detect and categorize forest types utilizing high spatial and ultra-high resolution remote sensing data is not yet widespread. The XGBoost model is part of a hybrid model for predicting forest fires vulnerability, integrated with a deep learning model-based approach for forests classification. This integration aims to enhance the performance of the fire risk prediction model, which is required urgently. The model's flexibility allows for the use of images collected by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and SPOT satellite equipment.
