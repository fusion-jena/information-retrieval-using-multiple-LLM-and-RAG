Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating that a deep learning model was used for classification, segmentation, or detection. Instead, the authors used the Random Forest (RF) algorithm for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. They trained the RF algorithm using training points collected in the field and the inputs of the best dataset, obtaining LULC maps with 30-m pixels. The RF algorithm was chosen because it has been shown to have one of the best accuracies in classifying satellite images to obtain LULC maps among other classification algorithms.

Therefore, the purpose of the model used in the study is not for deep learning but for classification using the Random Forest algorithm.
