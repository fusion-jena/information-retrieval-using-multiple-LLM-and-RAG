Answer:::

The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for forest biomass estimation include field surveys, airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors, and satellite imagery such as Landsat 8.

Field data are collected during the vegetation season, typically in July, using Field-Map technology on statistical forest inventory plots placed within the study area. These surveys provide tree positions, tree diameters, and heights, which are essential for estimating aboveground biomass (Ali et al., 2015; Xue, 2015).

Airborne LiDAR sensors are another common method for collecting raw data. LiDAR technology uses laser pulses to measure the distance between the sensor and the ground, providing high-resolution, three-dimensional information about the forest structure, including tree height, density, and biomass (Kankaer et al., 2013; Maltamo et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019). LiDAR data can be used to distinguish between live and dead standing tree biomass, which is crucial for accurate biomass estimation and forest management (Kim et al., 2009).

Satellite imagery, such as Landsat 8, is also used for collecting raw data. Landsat 8 provides multispectral data with a spatial resolution of 30 meters, which can be used to estimate forest biomass and other forest attributes (Anderson & Bolstad, 2013; Blackburn et al., 2021; Bouvier et al., 2015; Comparison of machine-learning methods for above-ground biomass estimation based on Landsat imagery, 2017; aboveground biomass from combined LiDAR and Landsat 8 data, 2017).

Public datasets are another source of raw data for deep learning pipelines. For example, the study by Ali et al. (2015) used a public dataset of airborne LiDAR data and field survey data to train machine learning models for biomass estimation.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for forest biomass estimation include field surveys, airborne LiDAR sensors, satellite imagery, and public datasets. These methods provide high-resolution, three-dimensional information about the forest structure, including tree height, density, and biomass, which are essential for accurate biomass estimation and forest management.
