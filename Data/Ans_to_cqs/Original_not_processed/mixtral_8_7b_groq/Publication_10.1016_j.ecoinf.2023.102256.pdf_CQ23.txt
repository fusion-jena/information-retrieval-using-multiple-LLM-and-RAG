Answer:

The text provided does not give explicit information about measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the models were trained and tested with average evaluation measures over ten independent executions, which implies some form of re-sampling or cross-validation was used. Additionally, the models were tested with different methods, including the use of one-hot encoding, embeddings, and geographical priors, suggesting an attempt to increase the robustness and applicability of the model. Furthermore, the network was trained on a relatively small number of examples, which is often the case in ecology datasets, indicating a need for techniques to improve generalizability. However, without more specific information, a definitive answer cannot be given.
