Answer:::

The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context are not explicitly named as standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, they created custom datasets for their specific research purpose.

The training data included 8 shark species and 19 non-shark species commonly associated with sharks on baited underwater videos. These species were selected to add diversity in the training. After transforming video clips into still images at a rate of 1 frame per second, they annotated sharks and the 19 non-shark species present in the frames with bounding boxes. This resulted in 26,947 fish annotations.

In addition, they automatically generated negative samples using the Faster RCNN architecture, so there was no need to annotate any additional negative samples.

However, shark species that were infrequently captured in their clips (Carcharhinus albimarginatus, Galeocerdo cuvier, Nebrius ferrugineus, Negaprion acutidens) were excluded from the testing phase.

Therefore, the datasets used in this deep learning pipeline are custom datasets created from baited underwater videos, containing 8 shark species and 19 non-shark species, with annotations for sharks and non-shark species in the form of bounding boxes.
