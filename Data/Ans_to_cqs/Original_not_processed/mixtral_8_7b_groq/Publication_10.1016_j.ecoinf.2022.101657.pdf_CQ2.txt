Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in question uses video data as its primary input format. The videos are obtained from a curated subset of the GBIF database, which initially contained over 2300 videos. However, only 330 videos were found to be suitable for the pipeline's purpose. Each frame from these videos has been manually annotated to indicate the presence or absence of an animal.

The pipeline uses a multi-filter approach to reduce the number of images that need to be inspected by a machine learning (ML) model. This is because, while ML approaches exist that could theoretically be used for this task, they are currently too slow for practical use.

The context does not explicitly mention other data formats like audio, images, or CSV files being used in the pipeline. However, it is possible that these formats could be used in other stages of the overall system. For instance, annotated images might be generated from the video data during the manual annotation process. Similarly, CSV files could be used to store the annotations or other metadata related to the videos.

It is also worth noting that the pipeline assumes a consistent focal length for all cameras, using that of the RPi camera module. This suggests that the pipeline may not natively support videos with varying focal lengths without some form of preprocessing.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline primarily uses video data as its input format, with each frame being manually annotated to indicate the presence or absence of an animal. Other data formats like audio, images, or CSV files might be used in other stages of the system, but the context does not provide explicit information about this.
