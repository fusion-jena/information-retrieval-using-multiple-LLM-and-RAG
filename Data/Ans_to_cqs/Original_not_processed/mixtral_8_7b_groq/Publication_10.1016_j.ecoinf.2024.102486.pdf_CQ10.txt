Answer:::
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various tools and techniques used for deep learning, including the Deep Learning Toolbox by MathWorks, cuDNN, and Darknet, as well as the launching of a CUDA-capable Virtual-Machine (VM) instance on Google Cloud for deep learning projects. However, it does not mention or provide a link to the code repository for the deep learning pipeline.
