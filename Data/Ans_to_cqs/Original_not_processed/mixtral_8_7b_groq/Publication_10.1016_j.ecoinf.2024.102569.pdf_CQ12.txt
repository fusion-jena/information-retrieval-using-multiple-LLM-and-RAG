Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it does not appear that any specific type of deep learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer, is mentioned as being used in the pipeline.

The context describes a method for simultaneously carrying out shrinkage estimation and variable selection using a penalized loss function with an L1 penalty. This method is applied to a point process model for ecological informatics, which involves estimating the intensity function and the detection probability model.

The loss function used in this method is given by eq. (10) in Appendix A, but it is not specified what type of model the loss function corresponds to. It is possible that the loss function is used in conjunction with a deep learning model, but the context does not provide enough information to determine this.

Therefore, it is not possible to answer the query with certainty based on the provided context.
