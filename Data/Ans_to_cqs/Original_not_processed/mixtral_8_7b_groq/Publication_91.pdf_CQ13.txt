Answer:::
 The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include a batch size of 32 and an initial learning rate of 0.001. The learning rate was exponentially decayed every 3 epochs with a factor of 0.94. The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) and was trained using a dataset of 426,876 images, which was split into three sets for training, validation, and testing in the proportions 80 : 10 : 10. The dataset consisted of 35,573 images for each of the 12 channels covering 35 species. All images were center cropped to an equally sized rectangle and augmented by flipping horizontally and vertically, adjusting brightness by 12.5%, adjusting saturation by 50.0%, adjusting contrast by 12.5%, and adjusting hue by 20% to increase the robustness and generalization ability of the classifier. The specific type of optimizer used is not mentioned in the provided context.
