Answer:::

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in the study include classification accuracy, Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), and possibly other metrics that are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Classification accuracy is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. It is defined as the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. In the study, the classification accuracy of the deep learning models was reported as a percentage, with a maximum accuracy of 98.2% ± 0.85 SD at 0 m for BirdNET, and a minimum accuracy of 39.8% ± 4.3 SD at 300 m for MFCCs.

Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) is another metric used to evaluate the performance of clustering algorithms. NMI measures the similarity between two clusters, and it is normalized to range between 0 and 1. In the study, NMI was used to evaluate the performance of affinity propagation clustering and HDBSCAN, and the results were reported as a function of distance for each of the five feature types.

The study did not explicitly mention other metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score. However, these metrics could have been used in addition to classification accuracy and NMI to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the deep learning models.

Overall, the study used classification accuracy and NMI to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models for individual gibbon discrimination. While the study did not achieve the expected performance using pre-trained CNNs, it suggests that training a model with data input of gibbon vocalizations might result in better performance. However, such data training requires a large dataset and is computationally costly.
