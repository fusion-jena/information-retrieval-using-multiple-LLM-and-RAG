Based on the provided context, there is no information about a specific code repository for a deep learning pipeline. The closest related reference is the paper by Kovalev et al. (2016) that compares different deep learning frameworks such as Theano, Torch, Caffe, Tensorflow, and deeplearning4j. However, the paper does not mention any code repository for a deep learning pipeline.

It is possible that the authors developed their own code for the comparisons, but they did not provide a link to the repository in the paper. Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to determine where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is available.

However, it is worth noting that many deep learning projects are available on popular code repositories such as GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket. Therefore, it is possible that a deep learning pipeline code repository exists on one of these platforms, but it is not related to the paper by Kovalev et al. (2016).

In summary, based on the provided context, there is no information about a specific code repository for a deep learning pipeline.
