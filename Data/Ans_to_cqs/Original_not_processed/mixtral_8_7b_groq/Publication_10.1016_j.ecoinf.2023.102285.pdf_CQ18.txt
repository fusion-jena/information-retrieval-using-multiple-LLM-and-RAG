Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves a three-phase evaluation process outlined in Figure 3 of the document. The first phase is cross-validation, where the model's performance is assessed using a portion of the dataset it was trained on. This helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting the training data. The second phase involves testing the model on a separate dataset that was not used in the training or cross-validation process. This phase is used to further evaluate the model's performance and generalizability. Finally, the third phase involves having field experts evaluate the model using a completely new dataset that is independent from the first and second datasets. This phase is used to ensure that the model can be deployed in a real-world setting and that it performs well when used by experts.

In addition to this, during the training phase, the experimental design of data utilization and data processing phases with their targeted objectives are outlined in Table 3 regarding the APEMâ€™s database. The viability of the methodology was ensured in 4 phases, including Phase III. Evaluation using recent surveys, where a dataset was prepared to evaluate the eligibility of the methodology. This set consists of 57 images with ISMMMOs and 5000 images with no ISMMMOs, and it is not included in the dataset used for the establishment of the methodology. The test results are displayed in Table 10 B. The satisfactory results obtained in this phase (Se, Sp, PPV, NPV, and ACC > 0.95) allowed the researchers to move to the next phase of verification by field experts using other independent datasets.

Overall, the strategy for monitoring the model performance during training involves a combination of cross-validation, testing on separate datasets, and evaluation by field experts using independent datasets. This approach helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting the training data, that it generalizes well to new data, and that it performs well in a real-world setting when used by experts.
