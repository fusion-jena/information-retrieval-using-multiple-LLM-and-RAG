Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models for weed detection are presented in Table 2. Two models are discussed in the context, YOLOX and YOLOv8. The initial learning rate for both models is 0.01. The learning rate schedule for both models is warm-up followed by cosine decay. The NMS threshold for YOLOX is 0.45, while for YOLOv8 it is 0.7. The confidence threshold for YOLOX is 0.25, and for YOLOv8, it is 0.7. The weight decay for both models is 0.0005. The image size for both models is 800, and the batch size is 8. The optimizer used for both models is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

In addition to these hyperparameters, there are other loss functions and data augmentation techniques mentioned in the context. For classification loss, Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) is used. For location loss, Intersection over Union (IoU) is used. Data augmentation techniques include color jitter and mosaic for the YOLO models. Additionally, Virtual Feature Learning (VFL), Domain Feature Learning (DFL), and Complete IoU (CIoU) are mentioned, but it is not explicitly stated if they are hyperparameters or components of the models.

It is also worth noting that when training the I3Net modules for cross-season weed detection, a different learning rate scheme was implemented. The initial learning rate was set to 0.001 for training the I3Net modules, which aimed to ensure the effective learning of source-domain information, being less disturbed by the target domain images. Thereafter, the learning rate was reinitialized to 0.01 to enhance feature adaptation to the target domain.
