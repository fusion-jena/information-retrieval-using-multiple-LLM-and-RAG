Answer:::

 Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text describes the architecture of the SeedNet model, a CNN-based network for seed classification and retrieval, and provides details about the network's layers, activation functions, and input/output sizes. It also mentions a comparison of SeedNet with other networks in terms of retrieval performance. However, there is no information about where the code for this study is hosted, if it is available publicly, or which platform was used to manage the code (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket). Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
