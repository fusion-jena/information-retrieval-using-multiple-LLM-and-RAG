Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). This is a generative model that combines ideas from deep learning and Bayesian inference. VAEs consist of an encoder and a decoder network, where the encoder maps the input data to a latent representation, and the decoder reconstructs the input data from the latent representation. The model is trained to minimize the difference between the input data and the reconstructed data, while also encouraging the latent representation to follow a specified distribution, typically a standard normal distribution. In this specific pipeline, the VAE uses a bottleneck dimension of 2 to create a 2-dimensional latent representation of the input data, which can be visualized and used for clustering. The VAE is implemented in PyTorch and trained for 5000 epochs using the Adam optimizer.
