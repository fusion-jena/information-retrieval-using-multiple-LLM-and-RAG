The article does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation to increase the size of the training dataset. Data augmentation involves random variations and manipulations to the data, such as flipping, cropping, adjusting contrast, translating, and rotating the images. This can help to increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting of the model to specific patterns in the original dataset.

Additionally, the article mentions that the tiles containing Pacific oysters were split into 70% training and 30% validation, which is a form of stratified splitting. Stratified splitting ensures that the distribution of the target variable (in this case, the presence or absence of Pacific oysters) is similar in both the training and validation datasets. This can help to ensure that the model is trained on a representative sample of the data and is not biased towards one class or the other.

However, the article does not mention any techniques such as oversampling or undersampling, which are used to address class imbalance in the dataset. Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class, while undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class. These techniques can help to ensure that the model is trained on a balanced dataset and is not biased towards the majority class.

In summary, while the article does mention the use of data augmentation and stratified splitting to increase the diversity of the training data and prevent bias, it does not explicitly mention the use of oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
