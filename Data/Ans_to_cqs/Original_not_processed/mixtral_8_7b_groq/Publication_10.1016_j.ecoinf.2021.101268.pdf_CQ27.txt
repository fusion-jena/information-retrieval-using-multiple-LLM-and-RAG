The provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the models were tested using different testing sets, specifically swapping testing sets between pre-processed and raw images. This was done to analyze the model's behavior and robustness, with the results showing that the models suffered an accuracy drop, particularly ResNet-101 and DenseNet-201, which decreased up to 52%.

Additionally, the context provides information about the dataset used, which is the first Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset, including its detailed metadata and acquisition protocol description. The dataset collects 59,441 samples from ten of the most profitable and endangered species, using six different commercial cameras to ensure variability and develop any flexible solution with real-world conditions in the future.
