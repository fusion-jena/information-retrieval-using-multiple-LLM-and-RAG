Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, the context does mention that an input size is a parameter that is optimized during the model training process. The optimized input size is (200, 250, 3), which could imply some form of resizing or padding of the input images.

Additionally, the context mentions that the research team exploits existing deep learning techniques in combination with statistical fundamentals to overcome the limitation in the dataset size. This suggests that some form of data augmentation, which is a common deep learning technique, may have been used. Data augmentation involves creating new synthetic samples from the existing data, which can help increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, and reduce overfitting. Common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, zooming, and cropping the images.

Furthermore, the context also mentions that the performance of the runs was studied using TensorBoard, which is a set of visualization tools included in the open-source library for machine learning TensorFlow. TensorBoard provides various visualizations such as histograms, images, and scalars, which can help monitor and debug the training process. These visualizations can provide insights into the distribution of the data, the behavior of the model, and the effect of the preprocessing steps.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention specific preprocessing steps, it does suggest that some form of input resizing or padding, data augmentation, and monitoring of the training process may have been used. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
