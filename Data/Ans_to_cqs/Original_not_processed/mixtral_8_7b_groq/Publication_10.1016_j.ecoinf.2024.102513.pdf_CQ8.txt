Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The texts focus on the methodology, results, and future research directions related to land use and land cover (LULC) classification in the Kerch Peninsula.

The authors describe their approach using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for LULC classification. However, they do not mention where the code or implementation details can be found. It is possible that the authors did not make the code publicly available or that it was not specified in the given excerpts.

If you are interested in the code repository, I would recommend contacting the authors directly or looking for the full paper to see if they provide more information on where to find the code.
