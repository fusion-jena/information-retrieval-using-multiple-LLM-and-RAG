Based on the provided context, there is no information suggesting that a deep learning model was used or evaluated. However, the context does provide several metrics used to evaluate the performance of other machine learning models.

For regression models, the following metrics were used:

1. Coefficient of Determination (R-squared): This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). The R-squared values for the Random Forest (RF) model were 0.66, 0.70, and 0.81, indicating a strong fit to the data.

2. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): This metric measures the standard deviation of the prediction errors. A lower RMSE indicates better performance. The RMSE values for the different models ranged from 11.73 to 35.95.

3. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This metric measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. A lower MAE indicates better performance. The MAE values for the different models ranged from 11.73 to 30.97.

For the Random Forest model, the following hyperparameters were optimized to achieve the observed level of performance:

1. max_depth: The maximum depth of the trees. This was set to 25 for the best-performing RF model.

2. n_estimators: The number of trees in the forest. This was set to 1000 for the best-performing RF model.

3. mtry: The number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split. This was set to 1, 3, or 7 for the best-performing RF model.

For Support Vector Regression (SVR) models, the following parameters were tuned:

1. C: The regularization parameter. A higher C value implies a higher penalty for misclassifications, leading to a more complex decision boundary.

2. Sigma: The bandwidth, which controls the width of the Gaussian kernel. A larger bandwidth implies a smoother, more generalized model.

In conclusion, while the context does not provide information on the evaluation metrics for deep learning models, it does provide several metrics and parameters used for evaluating and optimizing the performance of regression models such as Random Forest and Support Vector Regression.
