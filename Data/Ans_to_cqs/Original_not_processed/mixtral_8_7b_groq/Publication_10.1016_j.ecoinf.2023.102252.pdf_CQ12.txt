Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not specified. The text discusses the use of environmental flow models, empirical approaches, and the natural flow regime to evaluate the health of ecosystems. It also mentions the need for accurate mapping of environmental flows to ecological responses, which can involve substantial data requirements and computational costs. However, it does not mention any specific deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
