Answer:::

The text provided discusses a deep learning pipeline for plant classification, but it does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting the raw data. However, it does mention the use of two specific datasets: Google Image Search and Portuguese Flora.

For the Google Image Search dataset, the authors automatically retrieve the first 10 images returned by the search engine for a set of preselected labels. These labels are chosen to be the most popular ones, with more than 12 images in the training dataset, in an attempt to minimize the presence of mislabeled images.

For the Portuguese Flora dataset, no details are given about how the images were collected.

Additionally, the authors mention the use of pretrained weights from the ImageNet dataset, which is a large public dataset used for image classification tasks.

In summary, the raw data for the plant classification pipeline is collected through a combination of using public datasets (ImageNet), automated web search (Google Image Search), and possibly other unspecified methods for the Portuguese Flora dataset.
