The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the study. However, it does provide information about the data collection and preprocessing.

The dataset used in the study consists of humpback whale sounds, collected with a sampling rate of 32 kHz and a window size of 2 seconds. The sounds were then converted to images, with a window size of 2 seconds and a resolution of 90 dpi. These images were used as input for the customized convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture.

The study mentions that the most suitable architecture was chosen based on the best validation accuracy and precision obtained during training. However, it does not provide information on how the data was augmented to improve the model's performance.

In general, data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset. These techniques can help improve the model's ability to generalize and reduce overfitting.

Flipping involves creating new images by flipping the original images horizontally or vertically. This can help the model learn to recognize features that may appear in different orientations.

Rotating involves creating new images by rotating the original images by a certain angle. This can help the model learn to recognize features that may appear at different angles.

Scaling involves creating new images by scaling the original images up or down. This can help the model learn to recognize features that may appear at different scales.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the study, it is possible that the authors used some or all of these techniques to improve the model's performance. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
