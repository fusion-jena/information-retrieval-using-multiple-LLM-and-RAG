Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context consists of several tables and excerpts from an article that discusses the use of deep learning models, specifically the XGBoost model, for object recognition and categorization in high spatial and ultra-high resolution remote sensing data. The study focuses on forest-type categorization and its impact on forest fire risk.

The context includes tables presenting the land use/land cover classification accuracy, accuracy of forest types, and the spatial distribution and percentages of forest types in the study site using XGBoost. However, there is no mention of the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study.

If the code repository link is crucial for your research, I recommend reaching out to the authors of the study, V.T. Pham et al., for further information. They may be able to provide you with the necessary details.
