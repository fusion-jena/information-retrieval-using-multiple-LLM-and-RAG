Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the Random Forest model were optimized in the study. The study mentions the use of Random Forest as a machine learning algorithm for species distribution modeling, but it does not go into detail about the methods used for hyperparameter tuning.

Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned from the data, but instead are set prior to training the model. These parameters can have a significant impact on the performance of the model. Common methods for hyperparameter tuning include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.

Grid search involves specifying a range of possible values for each hyperparameter and then training the model with all possible combinations of those values. This method is exhaustive, but it can be computationally expensive, especially for models with many hyperparameters.

Random search is a more efficient alternative to grid search that involves randomly selecting values for each hyperparameter from a specified range. This method has been shown to perform as well as grid search for hyperparameter tuning, but with fewer iterations.

Bayesian optimization is a more sophisticated method that uses Bayesian inference to iteratively select the most promising hyperparameter values to try next. This method can be more efficient than both grid search and random search, especially for models with many hyperparameters.

Without more information from the study, it is not possible to say for sure which method was used for hyperparameter tuning. However, it is mentioned that other approaches were used to produce robust species distribution models, such as training data bootstrapping and spatial scale optimization. It is possible that hyperparameter tuning was also included as part of these approaches, but the context does not provide enough detail to make a definitive conclusion.
