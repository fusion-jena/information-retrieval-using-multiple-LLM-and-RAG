Answer: The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned directly in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the datasets are related to ecological informatics and involve classifying different tree species using RGB images or hyperspectral data. The context mentions that the deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), were used to distinguish specific tree species using a varying number of bands, ranging from 3 to 72. The datasets seem to be derived from hyperspectral images, as the context discusses the process of disassembling 36-band and 72-band images into single-band images using the Python Rasterio module. The disassembling process was done to reduce the hardware resources and computing time required for deep learning while limiting the impact on the model's accuracy.

In summary, while the specific names of the datasets are not provided, the context suggests that the datasets are related to ecological informatics and involve hyperspectral images of tree species. The deep learning models used were CNNs, and the number of bands in the datasets varied from 3 to 72.
