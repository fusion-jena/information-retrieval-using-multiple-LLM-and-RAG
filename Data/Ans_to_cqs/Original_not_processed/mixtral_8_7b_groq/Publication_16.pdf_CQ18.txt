Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of both test and validation data to calculate the loss of the model throughout the training session. Figure 9 shows the loss of the model over 100 epochs, providing a clear visualization of the model's performance during training. The use of both test and validation data helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data, which is further supported by the inclusion of dropout layers for model regularization.

Additionally, the model's accuracy is also monitored during training using both train and validation data, as shown in Figure 10. This allows for the observation of the model's convergence and the determination of the necessary number of epochs required for accurate model performance.

Furthermore, the classification results are presented using evaluation metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, as outlined in the materials and methods section. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance during training and its ability to accurately classify the target species.

Overall, the strategy for monitoring the model's performance during training involves the use of both test and validation data to calculate the loss and accuracy of the model throughout the training session, as well as the presentation of classification results using evaluation metrics. This approach helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting and is accurately classifying the target species.
