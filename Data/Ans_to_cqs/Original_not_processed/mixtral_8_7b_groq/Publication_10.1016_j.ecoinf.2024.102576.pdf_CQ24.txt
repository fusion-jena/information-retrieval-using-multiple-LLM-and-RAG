In the contexts provided, there is no explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it is widely acknowledged in the machine learning community that setting a random seed value is an important practice to manage randomness in deep learning models. This ensures reproducibility of results by controlling the randomness in processes like weight initialization, data shuffling, and dropout layers (Chollet, 2021; Goodfellow et al., 2016).

In the context of land use and land cover change studies, deep learning models like U-Net, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN), are used for image classification and land-cover classification (Jagannathan & Divya, 2021; Kattenborn et al., 2021; Kim et al., n.d.). These models rely on large amounts of labeled data for training. While the provided contexts do not discuss the management of randomness in these studies, it is still crucial to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.

In summary, although not explicitly mentioned in the provided contexts, setting a random seed value is an essential strategy to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. This ensures reproducibility of results and is a common practice in the machine learning community.
