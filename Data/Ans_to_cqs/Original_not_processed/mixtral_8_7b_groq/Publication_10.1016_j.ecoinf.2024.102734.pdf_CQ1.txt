Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about how the raw data is collected in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the raw data is segmented into 5-second spectrograms, and a pre-trained feature extraction model generates 527-dimensional embedding vectors for each segment. This suggests that the data is likely collected through some form of audio recording, which could be done through surveys, sensors, or public datasets.

Surveys could involve researchers going into the field and manually recording sounds using equipment such as microphones or shotgun microphones. Sensors could involve the use of automated recording devices that are set up in specific locations to continuously record audio. Public datasets could be pre-existing collections of audio recordings that are available for researchers to use.

It's also worth noting that the context mentions the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) public challenge, which suggests that publicly available datasets may be used in this particular pipeline.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about how the raw data is collected, it can be inferred that the data is likely collected through some form of audio recording, which could be done through surveys, sensors, or public datasets.
