Answer:::
In the context provided, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it is mentioned that few-shots learning algorithms are used when there are very few images per class available. These algorithms are designed to compute a classification task with only a few thumbnails to train.

In the context of few-shots learning, one common approach to determine when training is complete is to use a validation set, which is a separate set of data not used in training, to evaluate the performance of the model. If the performance on the validation set stops improving or starts getting worse, even if the model is still learning from the training data, it is an indication that the model is overfitting to the training data and training should be stopped. This is often referred to as early stopping.

Another approach that can be used to determine when training is complete is to use a convergence criterion. This is a condition that, when met, indicates that the model has reached a satisfactory level of performance and training can be stopped. For example, a convergence criterion could be that the difference in the loss function between two consecutive iterations of the training algorithm is below a certain threshold.

In the case of few-shots learning, it is also possible that the training process is not completed in the traditional sense, but rather the model is trained for a fixed number of iterations or epochs, and then used to make predictions on new data.

In summary, while the context provided does not give specific information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete, it is mentioned that few-shots learning algorithms are used when there are very few images per class available. These algorithms typically use a validation set or a convergence criterion to determine when training is complete. Additionally, in few-shots learning, the training process may not be completed in the traditional sense, but rather the model is trained for a fixed number of iterations and then used to make predictions on new data.
