The provided context discusses the use of a specific data allocation strategy and the implementation of an early stopping strategy in the training process, but it does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection for addressing data bias during preprocessing.

However, the context does mention that the dataset is divided chronologically into a training set, a validation set, and a test set, with a ratio of 70%, 10%, and 20%, respectively. This allocation strategy helps to prevent data snooping bias and enhances the generalizability of the model by ensuring that the data in the validation and test sets differ from the training set data. This can be seen as a form of diverse data collection, as it ensures that the model is exposed to a variety of data during training.

Additionally, the context also mentions the use of an early stopping strategy, which helps to prevent overfitting issues by stopping the training process before the last epoch if the model's performance on the validation set stops improving.

It is also worth noting that the context does not mention any specific issues related to data imbalance or sparseness, which are different from data bias.

In summary, the provided context discusses the use of a chronological data allocation strategy and an early stopping strategy in the deep learning pipeline, but it does not explicitly mention techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
