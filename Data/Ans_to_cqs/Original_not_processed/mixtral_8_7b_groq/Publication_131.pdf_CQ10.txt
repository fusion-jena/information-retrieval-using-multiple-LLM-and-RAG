I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context contains information about the structure of a CNN used for sound classification, the data split strategy for training and testing, and the system setup for the CNN. However, it does not mention the link to the GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository where the code for the deep learning pipeline is stored.
