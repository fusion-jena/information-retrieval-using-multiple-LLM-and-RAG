The provided pieces of context do not contain information about optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.

The context includes information about data repositories, including Dryad, Zenodo, and Ag Data Commons, as well as tools and methods for assessing the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIRness) of research data. However, there is no mention of deep learning pipelines or optimization techniques used in them.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
