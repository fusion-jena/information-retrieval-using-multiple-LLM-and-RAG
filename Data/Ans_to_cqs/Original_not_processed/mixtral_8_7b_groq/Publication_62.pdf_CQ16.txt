Answer:::
The context provided does not give specific details about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) mentioned. However, it is common in machine learning and deep learning practices to use validation loss plateau as a criterion to decide when to stop training. This method involves monitoring the loss function value on a validation dataset that is separate from the training dataset. If the loss function value does not decrease significantly over a certain number of epochs, it suggests that the model has reached a plateau, indicating that further training may not improve the model's performance.

In the context provided, Table 1 and Table 2 describe the architectures of the CNNs used for mercury analysis and clubmoss/spikemoss analysis, respectively. The architecture includes various layers such as ConvolutionLayer, BatchNormalizationLayer, Ramp (ReLU), PoolingLayer, FlattenLayer, DropoutLayer, LinearLayer, and SoftmaxLayer. The loss function to be minimized during training is not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that it is a classification problem since a SoftmaxLayer is used at the end of each CNN.

The text also highlights the importance of metadata curation for machine learning projects, mentioning that the mercury analysis required many person-hours to visually inspect images for staining, whereas clubmoss and spikemoss images were easily compiled using specimen metadata alone. This suggests that the mercury analysis dataset might have been more complex or noisy than the clubmoss/spikemoss dataset, requiring more extensive training or fine-tuning of the CNN.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific details about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the CNNs mentioned, it is common practice in machine learning to use validation loss plateau as a stopping criterion. The provided tables describe the architectures of the CNNs used for mercury and clubmoss/spikemoss analysis, and the text emphasizes the importance of metadata curation for machine learning projects.
