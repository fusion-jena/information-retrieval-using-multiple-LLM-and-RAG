Unfortunately, the context provided does not specify the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The sources cited in the study primarily focus on the methodology, results, and implications of the research, without explicitly mentioning where the data used in the study is stored or deposited. Common data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF are not mentioned in the context. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.
