Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the exponential smoothing model used in the study by Nakhjiri and Kakroodi (2024) were optimized. The study focuses on the performance of the exponential smoothing model in predicting major atmospheric pollutants but does not mention any specific method for hyperparameter tuning.

Hyperparameter tuning is an essential step in building machine learning models, including time series forecasting models like the exponential smoothing model. Grid search and random search are two common methods for hyperparameter tuning. Grid search involves systematically trying all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a specified range, while random search randomly selects a subset of hyperparameters to try.

Without specific information from the study, it is impossible to determine whether grid search, random search, or another method was used for hyperparameter tuning. It is possible that the authors used a default set of hyperparameters or manually adjusted them based on their expertise and experience.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that there is no available information on how the hyperparameters of the exponential smoothing model were optimized in the study by Nakhjiri and Kakroodi (2024).
