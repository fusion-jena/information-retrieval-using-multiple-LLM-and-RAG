Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that a deep learning LSTM model was used in a study to predict air quality (Navares and Aznarte, 2020).

In general, deploying a deep learning model involves several steps after training the model. Here are some common steps that are typically followed:

1. Model serialization: This involves saving the trained model to a file so that it can be loaded and used later. Model serialization is important for deploying the model in a production environment.
2. Platform selection: The choice of platform for deploying the model depends on the specific requirements of the application. Common platforms for deploying deep learning models include cloud services (such as AWS SageMaker or Google Cloud AI Platform), on-premises servers, or edge devices (such as Raspberry Pi or NVIDIA Jetson).
3. Model optimization: Depending on the platform, it may be necessary to optimize the model for deployment. This can involve techniques such as model pruning, quantization, or distillation to reduce the model size and improve inference speed.
4. Integration with other systems: The deployed model may need to be integrated with other systems, such as data pipelines, user interfaces, or business logic.

Without more specific information from the provided context, it is not possible to say for sure which of these steps were followed in deploying the deep learning model used in the study. However, it is safe to assume that some or all of these steps were taken to deploy the model in a production environment.
