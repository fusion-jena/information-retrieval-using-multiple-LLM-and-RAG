Answer:::
The type of deep learning models used in the pipeline are not explicitly specified in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that they are using neural networks with hidden layers based on Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) and Variational Bayesian Inference (VBI) methods. These methods are used for dealing with uncertainty in the model's predictions. The neural networks are built from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras, and the MCD layers are a modification of the Keras Dropout class, while the layers based on the VBI method derive from the TensorFlow Probability module. The input layer size depends on the problem, and the output layer is a fully-connected layer with two nodes, indicating that the focus is on regression problems.

It can also be noted that the context discusses the application of these models in agriculture, specifically for predicting crop growth and development. The input features include Day of Year (DOY) and Growing Degree Days (GDD), which are commonly used variables in crop growth modeling.

Therefore, while the specific type of deep learning model (such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers) is not mentioned, it can be inferred that the models are custom neural networks with uncertainty quantification methods, applied to crop growth prediction in agriculture.
