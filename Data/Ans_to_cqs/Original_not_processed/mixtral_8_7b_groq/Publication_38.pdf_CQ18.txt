Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the model is evaluated on a test set of 500 files from the iBats Romania and Bulgaria dataset, and it is compared to the performance of SonoBat, a well-established tool for bat call analysis.

The authors mention that their CNNFAST model takes less than 10 seconds to process the 500 files in the test set, while SonoBat takes 30 minutes in batch mode. This comparison suggests that the model performance is being monitored in terms of both accuracy and processing time.

Additionally, the authors use a sliding window fashion to apply the CNN model to the input spectrogram, predicting the presence of a search-phase bat call at every instance of time in the spectrogram. This approach allows for the monitoring of the model's performance at different time instances and frequency bins, providing a more detailed evaluation of the model's performance.

Furthermore, the authors mention the use of unused annotations in the Bat Detective dataset to increase the training set size, and the development of user models for understanding which annotations and users are reliable. These strategies suggest that the model performance is being monitored not only during the testing phase but also during the development and training phases.

Overall, while the specific strategy for monitoring the model performance during training is not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the authors are using a combination of testing, comparison with existing tools, sliding window fashion, and user annotations to evaluate the performance of their CNNFAST model.
