Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model used in the study is object detection. The model is a multi-layer neural network known as a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), specifically the YOLO (You Only Look Once) DCNN. This model is used to detect the locations of potential objects in the image, which are then filtered using the Zooniverse data to obtain the final object detections. The object of interest in this study is wildebeest, and the model is used to count the number of wildebeest in survey images. The training dataset for the model is created by selecting 500 survey images at random and tiling them into 864 Ã— 864 subimages. These subimages are then passed through the YOLO DCNN using pretrained weights from the COCO dataset. The model outputs a list of potential object locations in each image, which are then filtered to obtain the final counts.
