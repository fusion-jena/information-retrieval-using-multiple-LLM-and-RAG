Answer:::

The provided context discusses various studies related to deep learning and ecoacoustic data, but it does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does give some insights into the data sources used in these studies.

In the study by Quinn et al., 2022, they used ecoacoustic data, which suggests that this data was collected using sensors or microphones placed in the environment to record sounds. Similarly, the study by Roca et al., 2022, also used ecoacoustic data, but they mention the use of "ROI data from our study site," which implies that they collected data from a specific region of interest.

In the context of bird species recognition, the study by Priyadarshani et al., 2018, mentions the use of "automated birdsong recognition" and "acoustic environments," which suggests that they used audio recordings of bird songs as their raw data. However, they do not explicitly mention how they collected these recordings.

The study by Snyder et al., 2022, mentions the use of the Arbimon pattern-matching routine for acquiring species present ROI data. Arbimon is a cloud-based platform for analyzing ecoacoustic data, which suggests that the raw data was collected using sensors or microphones and then uploaded to the platform for analysis.

In addition to these studies, the context also mentions the use of public datasets for deep learning. For example, the study by Pouyanfar et al., 2018, provides a survey of deep learning techniques and mentions the use of public datasets for training and validating deep learning models. However, they do not specify which datasets were used.

Overall, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it suggests that sensors or microphones are commonly used for collecting ecoacoustic data. Additionally, cloud-based platforms such as Arbimon may be used for collecting and analyzing this data. Public datasets may also be used for training and validating deep learning models. However, further research is needed to fully understand the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
