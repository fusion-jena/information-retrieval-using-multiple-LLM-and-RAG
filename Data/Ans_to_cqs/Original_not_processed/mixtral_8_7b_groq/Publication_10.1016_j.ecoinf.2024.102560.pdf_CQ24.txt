The provided context does not contain information related to the query about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. The context consists of various research articles and papers related to environmental science, geology, and hydrology. Therefore, I don't have the information to answer this query.

However, I can provide some general strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline:

1. **Random seed value**: Deep learning models often involve random initializations, such as weight initialization. To ensure reproducibility, researchers set a fixed random seed value to generate the same set of random numbers during each run.
2. **Data augmentation**: Data augmentation techniques, such as random cropping, rotation, and flipping, are used to increase the size of the training dataset and introduce randomness. This helps the model generalize better and reduces overfitting.
3. **Dropout**: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out a proportion of neurons during training. This helps prevent overfitting and encourages the model to learn more robust features.
4. **Shuffling**: Shuffling the training data before each epoch ensures that the model does not learn patterns specific to the order of the data.
5. **Batch normalization**: Batch normalization normalizes the inputs of each layer, reducing the dependence on the initial weights and making the training process more stable.
6. **Early stopping**: Early stopping is a technique that stops training when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving. This helps prevent overfitting and reduces the computational cost.

These are some of the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
