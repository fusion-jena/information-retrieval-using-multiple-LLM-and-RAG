Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link for such a pipeline. The article by Tucker et al., 2023, focuses on the development of a non-invasive method for species and sex identification of rare forest carnivores using footprint identification technology (FIT). The authors simplified the FIT approach by requiring fewer landmark points and making it easier to employ on tracks of varying quality. However, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link associated with it. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
