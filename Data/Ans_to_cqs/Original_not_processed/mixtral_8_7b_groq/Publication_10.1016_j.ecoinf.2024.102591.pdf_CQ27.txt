The text provided does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used for high-performance computing and that it hosts a vast remote sensing data catalog. It also mentions that JavaScript, Python, or R application programming interfaces (APIs) and the associated interactive development environments (IDEs) in GEE require a high-level technical expertise.

In the context of machine learning, model serialization is the process of saving a trained model to disk so that it can be loaded and used later, without having to retrain the model. Platform selection refers to choosing the hardware and software environment where the trained model will be deployed.

Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the trained deep learning model was likely serialized and saved to a disk, and then loaded and deployed on the GEE platform using JavaScript, Python, or R APIs. However, the text does not provide specific details about this process.
