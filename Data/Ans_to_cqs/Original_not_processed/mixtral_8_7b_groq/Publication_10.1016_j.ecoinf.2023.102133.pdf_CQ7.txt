Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does mention that various machine learning models, including a Random Forest (RF) model, were used for predicting Evapotranspiration (ETa) and optimizing irrigation water usage.

For the RF model, the hyperparameters were tested using a grid configuration, including the number of decision trees, the maximum depth of the decision tree, and the number of features considered by each tree when splitting a node. The best performance was achieved by the Random Forest method, with seven input features, obtaining a root mean square error (RMSE) and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.39 mm/day and 0.84, respectively.

In general, for machine learning models like RF, data splitting is a common practice to ensure the model's generalization ability. Typically, the dataset is divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing.

1. Training set: This set is used to train the model, i.e., to learn the underlying patterns in the data.
2. Validation set: This set is used during the model training process to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.
3. Testing set: This set is used to evaluate the final model's performance on unseen data.

However, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria or method used for splitting the data in this specific study. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based on the given information.
