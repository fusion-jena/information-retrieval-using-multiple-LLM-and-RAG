After reviewing the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several studies and sources, but none of them mention or provide a data repository for a deep learning pipeline.

The context mainly focuses on remote sensing and image processing techniques for vegetation and crop type identification, with some studies using machine learning algorithms for image analysis. However, none of the studies provide information about a deep learning pipeline or its data repository.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as there is no relevant information available in the given context.
