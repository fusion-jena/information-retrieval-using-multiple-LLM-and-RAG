Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the use of any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in a deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on a study related to animal vocalizations, specifically song variant patterns in birds.

The study involves data analysis, with Table 1 providing the number of tracked vocalizations of each song structure as a proportion of the whole dataset. The CRediT authorship contribution statement indicates that the authors were involved in various aspects of the study, including writing, reviewing, editing, visualization, validation, resources, project administration, methodology, investigation, formal analysis, supervision, software, data curation, and conceptualization.

The data availability statement mentions that the link to the data is shared in the manuscript, but it does not specify the nature of the data or its relevance to deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
