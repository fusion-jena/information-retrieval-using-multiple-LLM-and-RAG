Answer:::

The provided context does not include specific information about the deep learning model's architecture, such as the type of neural network used or the hyperparameters like learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, or number of neurons. The context focuses on the evaluation of the model's performance in predicting the presence and absence of Hyphantria cunea, a forest pest, using various bioclimate, biological, geographical, and human spread factors.

The performance metrics mentioned in the context include the correct prediction rate for "present" (76.84%), the prediction accuracy of the model for "absent" (77.55%), and the overall validation accuracy (76.17%). The tables in the context show the classification table, the model summary, and the variables included in the equation, but none of them reveal details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
