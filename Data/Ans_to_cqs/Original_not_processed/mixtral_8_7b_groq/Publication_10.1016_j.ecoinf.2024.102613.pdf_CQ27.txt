Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer some steps based on the mentioned figures and the general software deployment process.

Firstly, the deep learning model would have been trained and serialized. Model serialization is the process of saving the model's architecture, optimized weights, and other parameters into a file that can be used later for making predictions. This step is crucial as it allows us to store and load the model efficiently without having to retrain it every time.

Next, the reference architecture design (section 4) discusses the deployment view, which covers servers, clients, sensors, intelligent machinery, and IoT devices. In the case of fish farming (section 5.4.2), the architecture deployment view of smart dairy farming (Fig. 29) shows that the required modules are deployed to a central server. It can be inferred that the trained deep learning model would also be deployed on this central server in the fish farming system.

In the smart dairy farming context (section 5.4.1), a thin client is chosen for the client side since all modules and data are located on the central server. This suggests that the client-side application might be a web or mobile application that communicates with the central server for data processing and visualization.

However, the provided context does not mention any specific platform or technology stack used for deployment. Common choices for deploying deep learning models include cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure, or containerization technologies like Docker and Kubernetes.

In summary, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model would likely include model serialization and deployment on a central server. However, the specific platform or technology stack used for deployment is not mentioned in the provided context.
