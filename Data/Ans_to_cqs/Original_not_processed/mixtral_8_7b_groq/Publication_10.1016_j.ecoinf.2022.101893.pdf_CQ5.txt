Answer:::

The context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the description of a deep learning model for bird species recognition, but it does not mention the name of the dataset used.

In general, when developing a deep learning pipeline, various datasets can be used depending on the specific task and the goals of the project. Some commonly used datasets for image classification include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. For audio classification, other datasets may be used, such as the BirdCLEF dataset, which has been used in previous bird species recognition challenges.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific information about the dataset used, it is mentioned that the deep learning model is applied to bird species recognition, so it is likely that a dataset of bird sounds or spectrograms was used. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to this query.
