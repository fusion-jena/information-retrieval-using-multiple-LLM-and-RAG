Answer: In the deep learning pipeline described, the data format used is a spectrogram, which is a pictorial representation of audio data. Spectrograms are particularly useful for analyzing audio data in deep learning models because they convey the temporal dimension on the horizontal axis, while frequency increases along the vertical axis. The third dimension of a spectrogram, sound power level, is typically represented with color.

To prepare the audio data for deep learning analysis, the raw audio data is transformed into spectrogram images. These spectrogram images are then used as input data for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are specifically designed for image classification. CNNs are advantageous for this task because they involve end-to-end learning, where feature sets are not hand-selected, but instead learned during training.

The training database for the deep learning model consists of over 40,000 images of bio-, anthro-, and geophonies. The database is assembled by selecting three randomly selected days from each month of the calendar year and manually labeling spectrogram images via visual inspection by two trained graduate students. On average, around 60 images can be annotated per minute, which corresponds to 8 minutes of audio data.

In summary, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline described is a spectrogram, which is a pictorial representation of audio data. Spectrograms are used as input data for convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed for image classification. The training database consists of over 40,000 spectrogram images of various sound categories.
