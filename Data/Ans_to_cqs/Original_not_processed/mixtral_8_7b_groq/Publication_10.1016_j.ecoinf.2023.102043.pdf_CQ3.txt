Answer:::

The data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline described in the text involve the use of farm records, videos from barn cameras, and a web-based annotation tool. However, the specific techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation are not mentioned.

The annotation process begins with the information provided by the farm records filled by the stock persons and the output of a YAMNet-based goat vocalization detection algorithm. Additionally, videos from cameras positioned in the barns are used to support the labeling of goat vocalizations. These videos, along with the farm records, are used in a web-based annotation tool designed for the purpose.

The list of possible events, or event types, is provided by domain experts such as animal scientists and farmers. The event types include "goat birth", "goat death", and "food distribution", among others. Event instances, which are specific occurrences of event types, are annotated with details such as the date, time, and farm where they occurred.

The recording campaign lasted for an entire year to capture the variations in goat vocalizations throughout the year. The data collected includes approximately 10 million sound events lasting more than 34,000 hours.

Therefore, while the text provides details about the data sources and the annotation process, it does not explicitly mention the use of specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
