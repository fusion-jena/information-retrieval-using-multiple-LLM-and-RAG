The provided context discusses a study that uses citizen science data and social media posts to extract relevant records of red kite images. The study developed a workflow that functions as a data filter to downsample an initially large dataset into a human-analysable subset. However, the context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

The techniques commonly used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria, such as class labels, and then randomly splitting each subgroup to ensure that each subset has a similar distribution of classes.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class to balance the dataset.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class to balance the dataset.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from various sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population.

While the context does not explicitly mention any of these techniques, it does discuss the importance of using multiple data sources to obtain more complete and less biased datasets. The authors declare financial support from the Swiss National Science Foundation and the German Research Foundation, which may have supported the use of these techniques.

Therefore, while the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, it is possible that the study used one or more of these techniques to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
