Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The context discusses Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) and data mining processes, but it does not mention any specific deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers.

The context does mention that data mining can be supported by various data processing techniques, including verifying or interpreting results. Deep learning models can be used for data mining tasks, but the context does not specify which type of deep learning model is used in this case.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
