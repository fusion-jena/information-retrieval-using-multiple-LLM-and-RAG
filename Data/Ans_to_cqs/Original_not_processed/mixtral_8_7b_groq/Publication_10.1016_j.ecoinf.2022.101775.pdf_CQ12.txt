Answer:::

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline described in the given context is not explicitly specified. However, it is mentioned that an embedding layer, which is a module commonly used in deep learning models, is utilized. Specifically, the model referred to as DMF1 includes embedding layers (Tamhane et al., 2017; Fan and Cheng, 2018).

Embedding layers are often employed in natural language processing tasks and collaborative filtering to address the one-hot encoding problem by replacing sparse representations with dense vectors (Sharma et al., 2020; He et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2022). The DMF1 model, as described in Fan and Cheng (2018), consists of h hidden layers, with each layer having a weight matrix W(j), bias vector bi(j), and sigmoid activation function g(.) (Tamhane et al., 2017).

While the DMF1 model does not explicitly mention the use of a specific deep learning architecture like CNN, RNN, or Transformer, it is possible that one or more of these architectures could be integrated within the DMF1 model. For instance, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) could be used for processing image or signal data, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) could be employed for sequential data, or Transformers could be utilized for handling sequence-to-sequence tasks.

However, without further information on the specific implementation of the DMF1 model, it is not possible to definitively state the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
