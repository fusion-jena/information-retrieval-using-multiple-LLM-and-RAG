Answer:::

I am unable to provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the given context. The context includes several research papers and articles that discuss the application of deep learning techniques in various ecological studies, such as water quality analysis, vocalization detection, and biological soil crust monitoring. However, none of the papers provide a specific link to a code repository. It is common for research papers to omit this information, as the primary focus is on the methodology and results of the study. If you are interested in implementing a deep learning pipeline for ecological data analysis, I would recommend looking for open-source projects on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, or reaching out to the authors of the papers for additional information.
