Answer:::
The specific hyperparameters for the deep learning model used in the study, such as the learning rate or optimizer, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, we do know that the researchers used the fast.ai platform to train and validate their models. FastAI is a deep learning library that simplifies the process of creating and training neural networks, and it includes several default settings and options for hyperparameters.

The study does mention that the researchers used the pre-trained ResNet-34 architecture, which is a variant of the ResNet (Residual Network) family commonly used for deep learning tasks in computer vision. ResNet-34 consists of a 34-layer convolutional neural network that has been pre-trained on a large dataset like ImageNet. This pre-training process helps to initialize the model with reasonable weights and biases, which can improve performance and reduce training time.

In addition, the study mentions that they used a LOGO (Leave-One-Group-Out) cross-validation approach, where a complete 450 m multitemporal transect was omitted from the training process in each iteration and subsequently tested. This approach helps to ensure that the model's performance is assessed accurately, accounting for the data constraints and guaranteeing that every multitemporal transect undergoes both training and testing.

Overall, while the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not provided, we can infer that the researchers used the fast.ai platform and pre-trained ResNet-34 architecture, along with a LOGO cross-validation approach for training and testing their models.
