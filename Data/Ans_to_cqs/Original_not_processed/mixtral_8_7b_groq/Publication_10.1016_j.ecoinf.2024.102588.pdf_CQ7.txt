Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does mention the use of 10-fold cross-validation in the context of the deep learning models.

Cross-validation is a technique for assessing how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set. It is primarily used in settings where the goal is prediction, and one wants to estimate how accurately a predictive model will perform on unseen data.

In k-fold cross-validation, the original sample is randomly partitioned into k equal sized subsamples. Of the k subsamples, a single subsample is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining k − 1 subsamples are used as training data. The cross-validation process is then repeated k times, with each of the k subsamples used exactly once as the validation data. The k results can then be averaged to produce a single estimation.

In the given context, the deep learning models, including the CNN model and CNN with an autoencoder, were evaluated using the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and percentage bias (PBIAS) as evaluation metrics. The models were trained and validated using 10-fold cross-validation, and the mean and standard deviation values of the NSE and RMSE were reported in Table 3.

It's worth noting that the provided context does not mention any specific data splitting criteria for train, test, and validation datasets, but it does mention the use of cross-validation for evaluating the deep learning models.
