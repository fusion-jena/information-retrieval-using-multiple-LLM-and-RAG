Answer:::

The deep learning model in question is used for two main purposes: fish segmentation and fish classification by species.

For fish segmentation, the model is trained to identify and separate individual fishes from a given set of Yellowfin Tuna (YFT) images. This is evident in Fig. 3, which shows the individual fishes once the segmentation process is complete. The segmentation model underwent training with a search space of 1000 epochs, a batch size ranging from 500 to 5000, a learning rate between 0.0001 and 0.01, and softmax activation. The train/test split was set at 0.9/0.1. The segmentation model was trained on an Nvidia Tesla V100 (16GB) GPU for 4 hours, 6 minutes, and 24 seconds before reaching its best assignment.

For fish classification by species, the deep learning model is a residual neural network (ResNet50V2) that has been pre-trained with the ImageNet dataset. This model is capable of skipping some of its layers, as described by He et al. (2016). The classification model was trained with a batch size of 256, a learning rate of 0.0001, softmax activation, and a train/test split of 0.8/0.2. The model was trained on an Nvidia Tesla V100 (16GB) GPU for 9 hours, 22 minutes, and 34 seconds, achieving the best assignment during this time.

Additionally, data augmentation was used to improve the classification model's learning process and accuracy, as shown in Fig. 7. The classification model processed a total of 86,208 segments during its training.

In summary, the deep learning model serves two main purposes: fish segmentation and fish classification by species. The segmentation model separates individual fishes from a set of YFT images, while the classification model identifies fish species using a ResNet50V2 architecture. Both models were trained on an Nvidia Tesla V100 (16GB) GPU, with the segmentation model undergoing manual tuning and the classification model utilizing data augmentation for better accuracy.
