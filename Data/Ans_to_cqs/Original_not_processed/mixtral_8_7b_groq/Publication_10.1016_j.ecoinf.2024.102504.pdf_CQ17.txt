Answer:::

The provided context does not contain specific information about the regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline for predicting air quality. However, it is common practice in deep learning to use techniques such as dropout, L2 regularization, or early stopping to prevent overfitting.

Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and less prone to overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that discourages large weights, thereby reducing the complexity of the model. Early stopping is another regularization method that involves terminating the training process before the model starts to overfit, based on a validation set's performance.

In the Navares and Aznarte (2020) study, they used a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for predicting air quality, but they did not mention any specific regularization techniques. Similarly, Neckel et al. (2023) and Ogen (2020) did not provide details about the regularization methods used in their studies.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used in the deep learning pipelines for air quality prediction, it is standard practice to use techniques such as dropout, L2 regularization, or early stopping to prevent overfitting.
