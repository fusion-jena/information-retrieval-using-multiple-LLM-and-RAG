Answer:::

The data for training the deep learning model, called IUC-NN, was split using specific criteria to ensure the model's accuracy and predictive capabilities. Before training, the data set was randomly divided into a training set, consisting of 90% of the entries, and a test set, containing the remaining 10%. Additionally, 20% of the training set was used for validation. To account for the comparatively small size of the data set, cross-validation was performed by shifting the validation set five times. This allowed for the calculation of the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy.

The IUC-NN model with the lowest cross-entropy loss was then selected from a range of models with varying numbers of hidden layers and subsets of features. This neural network was used to predict the conservation status of all Orchidaceae species at two levels: binary (possibly threatened vs. not threatened) and detailed (CR, EN, VU, NT, and LC). The IUC-NN assessments were then combined with distribution data from WCSP to show the number and proportion of orchid species at different threat levels.

It is important to note that the data quality and potential sampling bias may impact the model's performance. Including data on species trade, land use, or life history, once they are available, may help increase the accuracy of IUC-NN and reduce its dependency on threat category. Additionally, combining the binary and detailed model, which sometimes produce contradictory results, may increase the performance of IUC-NN. Labeling species where the binary and detailed model disagree as data deficient might reduce the number of false predictions. Future developments of IUC-NN include quantifying the estimation of threat as a continuous parameter to increase the accuracy for intermediate threat levels and implementing Bayesian neural networks to quantify uncertainties in the prediction.
