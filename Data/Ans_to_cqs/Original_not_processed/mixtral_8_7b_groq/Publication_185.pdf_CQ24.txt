The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of stochastic gradient descent and the backpropagation algorithm for training a deep learning model. These techniques involve some degree of randomness, as they involve randomly selecting examples from the training dataset to update the model's weights.

In addition, the context discusses the use of data resampling to handle the issue of imbalanced data. This process involves randomly selecting examples from the majority and minority classes to balance the dataset. This is another example of how randomness can be used in a deep learning pipeline.

Furthermore, the use of white Gaussian noise for initializing the feature extractors in the CNN architecture can also be considered a way of introducing randomness in the model. This helps to break symmetry and allows the model to learn different features from the data.

It's worth noting that the use of randomness in deep learning can be beneficial, as it can help the model to generalize better and avoid overfitting. However, it's also important to control the level of randomness and ensure that the model is able to learn from the data in a consistent and reproducible manner. This can be achieved by setting a fixed random seed value at the beginning of the training process.

In summary, the provided context discusses the use of randomness in deep learning through the use of stochastic gradient descent, data resampling, and the initialization of feature extractors with white Gaussian noise. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value for controlling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
