Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the description of active learning strategies and models used in a specific study, without mentioning any bias mitigation techniques applied during data preprocessing.

However, it does mention the use of different sampling strategies like uncertainty sampling, diversity sampling, and their combinations for active learning. These techniques can indirectly help in reducing bias by ensuring that the model pays attention to informative and representative samples from the data distribution.

Additionally, the study mentions the use of different embedding models like BirdNet V2.4, VGGish, YAMNet, VGG16, and ResNet152-V2. The choice of these models might have been influenced by the desire to capture a diverse range of features and representations, which can help in reducing bias.

Lastly, the study mentions the use of scikit-maad for spectrogram computation. Spectrograms can provide a rich representation of audio data, which might help in capturing diverse patterns and reducing bias in the data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention any data bias mitigation techniques during preprocessing, it does discuss the use of various sampling strategies, diverse models, and rich data representations that could potentially contribute to reducing bias.
