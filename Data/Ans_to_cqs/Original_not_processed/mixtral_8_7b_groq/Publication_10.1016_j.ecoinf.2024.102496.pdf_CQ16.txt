Based on the provided context, there is not enough information to directly answer the query about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context focuses on environmental justice metrics, equitable nutrient reduction decision support tools, and best management practices (BMPs) for water quality, rather than training criteria for machine learning or model development.

However, it is common practice in machine learning and model development to use various criteria to determine when training is complete. These criteria can include:

1. Validation loss plateau: Training is considered complete when the validation loss stops decreasing or shows only negligible improvement over a certain number of epochs.
2. Early stopping: Training is stopped when the validation loss starts increasing, preventing overfitting.
3. Monitoring other metrics: Training can be considered complete when other metrics, such as accuracy or precision, reach a satisfactory level.
4. Patience: Training can be set to stop if the validation loss does not improve for a predetermined number of epochs.

These practices ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data and prevents overfitting. The specific criteria used to determine when training is complete would depend on the problem at hand, the data available, and the model being used.
