Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the deep learning experiment. Common optimization techniques used in training CNNs include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSProp. Therefore, it is possible that one or more of these techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline.

The context also mentions the use of batch normalization, which is a technique used to accelerate network training by reducing internal covariate shift. It normalizes the inputs of each batch, which can help the network converge faster and be more stable during training.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of the Caffe deep learning framework in the deep learning experiment. Caffe supports several optimization algorithms, including SGD, Adam, and RMSProp. Therefore, it is likely that one of these algorithms was used for training the CNN in the deep learning experiment.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is possible that SGD, Adam, or RMSProp were used, possibly in conjunction with batch normalization. The use of the Caffe deep learning framework also suggests that one of these optimization algorithms was likely used.
