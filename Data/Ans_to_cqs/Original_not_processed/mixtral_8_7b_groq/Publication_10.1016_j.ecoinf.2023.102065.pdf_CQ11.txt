Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The articles and papers mentioned in the context focus on the methods, techniques, and applications of deep learning in ecological informatics and birdsong recognition. However, they do not provide a direct link to a data repository for the pipeline.

In the BirdCLEF competition, the authors used weakly-labeled audio data available for training, but the specific source or repository of this data is not mentioned. Similarly, the study by Quinn et al. (2022) used ecoacoustic data for soundscape classification, but the data repository is not provided in the given context.

To access the data or code related to these studies, you may consider looking up the publications on academic databases such as Google Scholar or the ACM Digital Library, where authors may have provided links to their data or code repositories in the respective papers or supplementary materials.

An alternative approach would be to contact the authors directly, requesting access to the data or code used in their studies. Author contact information is usually available in the published papers or on their affiliated institutions' websites.
