Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it does mention the use of a training set (DT), an unlabeled data set (DU), and a validation set in the context of training an ensemble teacher model and a student model.

The training set (DT) is used to train the student model. It is initialized with a small number of labeled data points in step 1 and then gradually augmented with pseudo-labeled data points generated by the teacher model in steps 4-10. The unlabeled data set (DU) is used to sample unlabeled data points for pseudo-labeling.

The validation set is used to select the value of K, which is the number of pseudo-labeled data points generated every 100 epochs during the training of the SDP-EPL model. The value of K is selected empirically based on the AUC of SDP-EPL on the validation set.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the data is split into at least three sets: a training set (DT), an unlabeled data set (DU), and a validation set. The training set is used to train the student model, and the unlabeled data set is used to generate pseudo-labeled data points for augmenting the training set. The validation set is used for selecting the value of K and evaluating the performance of the model during training.

However, the context does not provide information on how the initial labeled data points are selected or how the unlabeled data set is created. It also does not mention the use of a separate test set for evaluating the final model performance.
