Answer:::

Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of a data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the description of a research workflow using various machine learning models, such as XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM). However, it does not specify where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. Common data repositories include Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF; however, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific repository for this deep learning pipeline.
