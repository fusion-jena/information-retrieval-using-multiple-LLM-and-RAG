Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a unique architecture called SubSpectralNet. The CNN model is based on a VGG style network, which has been previously used for classifying acoustic scenes. This network is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10âˆ’4, and the categorical cross entropy is utilized as the loss function. The SubSpectralNet model can be regarded as a filter with different configurations and is employed in conjunction with the Mel-spectrogram input. In addition, the models are fused to improve the classification performance, with the best classifier achieving a balanced accuracy of 86.31% and a weighted F1-score of 93.31%.
