Based on the provided context, the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include bounding box annotation and class name generation for the detected object.

In the training phase, the model's output is shown in Figure 12, which includes the labels of the detected object. This suggests that bounding box annotation is used to identify and label the objects of interest in the input images. The annotations are likely created manually by human annotators who draw bounding boxes around the objects and assign class labels to them.

Furthermore, in the validation phase, the model's output is shown in Figure 13, which includes the bounding box and class name generated and shown for the validated object by the model. This confirms that bounding box annotation is used for data annotation in the deep learning pipeline.

However, the context does not mention any other data annotation techniques such as instance segmentation or semantic segmentation. Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that bounding box annotation and class name generation are the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
