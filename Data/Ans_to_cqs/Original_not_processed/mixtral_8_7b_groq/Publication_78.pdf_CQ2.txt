Answer:
The deep learning pipeline used in the study referenced involves the use of underwater images as the primary data format. The pipeline begins with capturing images of underwater scenes using an underwater drone. These images are then preprocessed and resized to serve as input for the chosen deep convolutional neural network (D-CNN) model, specifically AlexNet. The input image size for AlexNet is 227 × 227 × 3, where the three channels represent the RGB color space.

In addition to using D-CNN models for spatial feature extraction, handcrafted descriptors are employed to extract texture and color features from the original underwater images. These handcrafted descriptors work with the image data format. However, the specific types of descriptors used and their individual configurations are not detailed in the provided context.

To summarize, the deep learning pipeline in this study primarily uses underwater image data, with additional handcrafted descriptor techniques applied to extract texture and color features from the images.
