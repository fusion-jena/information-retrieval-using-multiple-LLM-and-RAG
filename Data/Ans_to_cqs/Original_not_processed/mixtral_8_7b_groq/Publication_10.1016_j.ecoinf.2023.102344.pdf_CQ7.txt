Answer:::

In the context provided, the data was split for deep learning model training using a stratified sampling method. Specifically, 80% of the data (240 data rows) was used for training the model, while the remaining 20% (60 data rows) was used for testing.

Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that involves dividing the population into subgroups or strata, and then selecting a sample from each stratum. This method is used when the population is not homogeneous, and it ensures that the sample is representative of the entire population.

In this case, the population consists of images where the extracted numerical features were used in training. The stratified sampling method was used to ensure that the training and testing sets contained a similar distribution of these features.

It's worth noting that the data was not split into validation and training sets. The validation set is typically used to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. However, in this case, it seems that the model's performance was evaluated using only the training and testing sets.

Another important aspect to consider is the number of epochs used for training the model. In this case, all pre-trained models under Approach 1 converged the training after 1000 epochs. The number of epochs is a hyperparameter that determines the number of times the model will see the training data. A high number of epochs can lead to overfitting, while a low number may not allow the model to learn the features effectively.

In summary, the data was split for deep learning model training using a stratified sampling method, where 80% of the data was used for training and 20% for testing. The model's performance was evaluated using only the training and testing sets, and all pre-trained models under Approach 1 converged the training after 1000 epochs.
