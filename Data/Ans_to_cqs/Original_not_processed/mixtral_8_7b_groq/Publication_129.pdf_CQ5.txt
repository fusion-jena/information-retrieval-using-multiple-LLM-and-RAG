Based on the given pieces of context, there is no explicit mention of the use of standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the described deep learning pipelines. However, there are a few specific datasets mentioned in the context that are used in these studies.

In [18], the authors use a dataset for smart near-infrared analysis of water pollution for agricultural irrigation resources. The dataset is not named in the text, but it is a dataset specifically created for this study.

In [19], the authors introduce a large-scale benchmark dataset for insect pest recognition called IP102. This dataset is used to train and test the deep learning model for insect pest recognition.

In [20], the authors use a dataset for automatic localization and counting of agricultural crop pests. The dataset is not named in the text, but it is a dataset specifically created for this study.

In [21], the authors use an internal database for tomato plants to train and test their deep learning model for pest detection and identification.

Therefore, while the standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet are not explicitly mentioned, there are still specific datasets used in these studies. These datasets are created for the specific tasks and applications of the studies, and they are not publicly available datasets.
