Answer:::

 The deep learning pipeline data is not available in a single repository link like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, the GPS track data used in the analysis is available at <http://seabirdtracking.org/mapper/contributor.php?contributor_id=950>. The other data used within the analysis, such as GPS & dive data and associated matrices, are not publicly accessible due to the one-year embargo and the authors' request to contact them for more information. The corresponding authors' details are Ella Browning (ella.browning.14@ucl.ac.uk) and Robin Freeman (robin.freeman@ioz.ac.uk). The research article, "Predicting animal behaviour using deep learning: GPS data alone accurately predict diving in seabirds," provides more context on the data and methods used in the study.

 Additionally, the research article is available at <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.12926>, and the data availability statement mentions that the GPS track data used in the analysis are available at the provided link. The other data used within the analysis are available from the corresponding authors upon reasonable request.

 In summary, while the GPS track data is publicly available, the other data used within the analysis are not publicly accessible due to the embargo and the authors' request. The corresponding authors should be contacted for more information on the data and methods used in the study.
