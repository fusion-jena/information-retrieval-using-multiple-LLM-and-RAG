Answer:::

The provided context discusses the process of training a deep learning model for image classification, specifically for plant species recognition. While it does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, it does imply certain preprocessing procedures.

Firstly, the images are resized to a uniform resolution of 224x224 pixels before being fed into the model [36, 38]. This is a common practice in deep learning for computer vision tasks, as it ensures that the model receives inputs of a consistent size.

Secondly, data augmentation is used during the training process [38]. Specifically, "simple crop and resize" data augmentation is mentioned, which likely involves randomly cropping and resizing images to create additional training examples. This technique helps increase the diversity of the training data and reduces overfitting.

Thirdly, the context discusses the use of batch normalization [35, 38]. Batch normalization is a technique used to normalize the activations of neurons in a deep learning model, which can help improve the model's convergence and reduce internal covariate shift. While not a preprocessing step per se, batch normalization is applied during the training process and can be seen as a form of normalization.

Lastly, the context discusses the use of pre-trained models for transfer learning [38]. While this is not a preprocessing step, it does imply that the pre-trained model has undergone some form of preprocessing or training on a large dataset (ImageNet in this case).

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, it does imply certain preprocessing procedures, including resizing, data augmentation, batch normalization, and pre-training for transfer learning.
