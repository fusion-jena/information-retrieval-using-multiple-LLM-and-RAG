Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the specific criteria used to determine when the training process is complete for the classifier model. The text does mention that training data was collected using Landsat images and a cluster classification map, with 70 points selected for each of the five classes in the study area. These points were chosen using a stratified random sampling approach and distributed across the entire study area. However, the context does not mention any details about validation loss plateau or other criteria that might indicate the completion of training. It is possible that such criteria were used but were not included in the provided text. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query without additional information.
