Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the models are the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and slope. These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of the models in predicting chlorophyll-a concentration and turbidity using remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) data.

The coefficient of determination (R2) measures the proportion of variance in the target variable that is predictable from the input features. An R2 value closer to 1 indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

The root mean square error (RMSE) measures the difference between the predicted and actual values. A lower RMSE value indicates a better performance of the model.

The mean absolute error (MAE) measures the average magnitude of the errors in the predicted values. A lower MAE value indicates a better performance of the model.

The slope measures the change in the predicted values for a unit change in the actual values. A slope closer to 1 indicates a better performance of the model.

In the context, these metrics are used to compare the performance of five models, namely Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost. The models are evaluated using the same dataset, and the performance is assessed using 20 spectral bands and 17 spectral bands as training features for chlorophyll-a concentration and turbidity, respectively.

However, the context does not mention the use of accuracy, precision, or recall to evaluate the performance of the models. These metrics are commonly used in classification problems, and it is unclear if they are applicable to the regression problems addressed in this study.
