Answer:::

The provided context does not specify the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. Data will be made available on request, but there is no information about where it will be deposited or how it can be accessed. It is also not mentioned if the pipeline or only the data will be available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific repository for the deep learning pipeline.
