The provided pieces of context do not specify any particular datasets that are commonly used in the deep learning pipeline for bioacoustic classification, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, they do mention some datasets related to bioacoustic research.

One such dataset is the passive acoustic survey of deep-diving odontocetes in the California Current Ecosystem 2018 (Simonis, 2020). This dataset includes acoustic recordings of marine mammals in the California Current Ecosystem, which could be used for bioacoustic classification tasks.

Another dataset mentioned is the one used in the 2012 Southern California Behavioral Response Study (Kirsebom et al., 2022). This dataset includes acoustic recordings of marine mammals in Southern California, which were used to detect and classify marine mammal sounds.

The MERIDIAN open-source software for deep learning-based acoustic data analysis also mentions the use of acoustic datasets for bioacoustic classification (Kirsebom et al., 2022). However, the specific datasets used are not mentioned.

Finally, the paper on an acoustic survey in the Main Hawaiian islands using drifting recorders mentions the use of acoustic data for marine mammal detection and classification (McCullough et al., 2021). Again, the specific datasets used are not mentioned.

In summary, while the provided pieces of context do not mention any of the standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, they do mention several bioacoustic datasets that could be used for deep learning-based bioacoustic classification. However, the specific datasets used are not always mentioned.
