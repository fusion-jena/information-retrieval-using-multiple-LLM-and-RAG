The provided context discusses the use of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for reconstructing input data based on a probabilistic encoder and decoder, as well as the impact of the regularization term on the latent space. However, it does not directly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.

Common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified sampling: This technique involves dividing the dataset into strata based on the distribution of certain variables, and then ensuring that each stratum is proportionally represented in both the training and testing sets. This can help ensure that the model is exposed to a diverse range of examples and reduces the risk of bias.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of examples from underrepresented classes in the dataset. This can help ensure that the model is exposed to a sufficient number of examples from each class and reduce the risk of bias.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves decreasing the number of examples from overrepresented classes in the dataset. This can help ensure that the model is not overfitting to the dominant class and reduce the risk of bias.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population of interest. This can help ensure that the model is exposed to a diverse range of examples and reduces the risk of bias.

It is important to note that addressing data bias is an ongoing process throughout the entire deep learning pipeline, from data collection and preprocessing to model training and evaluation. By using a combination of these techniques, it is possible to reduce the risk of bias and improve the performance of the model.
