Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline of the study by Zhang et al. (2023). However, the paper does mention the use of deep learning for detecting time-delay water quality indicators of wastewater treatment plant influent. Common data augmentation techniques for image data, which could potentially be used in a deep learning pipeline for a similar task, include flipping, rotating, and scaling.

Flipping refers to creating new instances of the original data by horizontally or vertically flipping the image. This technique can help the model learn invariance to the direction of the features in the image.

Rotating involves creating new instances by rotating the original image by a certain angle. This can help the model learn to recognize features regardless of their orientation.

Scaling refers to changing the size of the original image. This can help the model learn to recognize features at different scales.

In addition, the context provides information about the machine learning training methodology used in the study. Specifically, a repeated nested k-fold cross-validation approach was employed for all machine learning models developed in the study. However, this methodology does not directly relate to data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline of the study by Zhang et al. (2023), it does suggest some potential techniques that could be used for similar tasks.
