The provided context does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe the creation of fire risk maps using various vegetation indices and machine learning algorithms. The process of creating these fire risk maps may involve data preprocessing techniques to address data bias.

In the context of creating fire risk maps, data bias could arise from an uneven distribution of fire incidents across different vegetation types or regions. To address this, one could employ techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, and undersampling during the data preprocessing stage.

Stratified sampling involves dividing the dataset into homogeneous subgroups or strata based on certain criteria, such as vegetation type or region, and then randomly selecting samples from each stratum. This ensures that each stratum is proportionally represented in the final dataset, reducing bias.

Oversampling is a technique used when a particular class or category is underrepresented in the dataset. By duplicating instances from the underrepresented class, the dataset is balanced, reducing bias.

Undersampling, on the other hand, is used when a particular class or category is overrepresented in the dataset. By removing instances from the overrepresented class, the dataset is balanced, reducing bias.

Diverse data collection is another technique that can be used to address data bias. By collecting data from various sources, regions, and vegetation types, the dataset becomes more representative, reducing bias.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, it is possible that these techniques were employed during the creation of the fire risk maps. Techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be used to address data bias during the preprocessing stage.
