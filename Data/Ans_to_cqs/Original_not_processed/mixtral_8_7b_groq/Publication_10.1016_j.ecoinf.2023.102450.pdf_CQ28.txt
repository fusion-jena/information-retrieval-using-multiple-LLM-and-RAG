The provided context does not give information about the specific platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model. We can infer that the experiments were performed on a personal computer with a 1060Ti GPU and Ubuntu 20.04 operating system. However, it is not specified whether the model was deployed on this computer or on a cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
