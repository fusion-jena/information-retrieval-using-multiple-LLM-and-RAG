Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and CSV files, among others. The specific data format used depends on the problem at hand and the type of input data available.

In the context of species distribution modeling, for instance, Botella et al. (2018a, 2018b, 2021) used presence-only data, which can be stored in CSV files, to train deep learning models for predicting species assemblages. These presence-only data typically consist of georeferenced records indicating the presence of a given species at a particular location.

On the other hand, when dealing with computer vision tasks, images are the most common data format. Bourhis et al. (2023) used images of butterflies and moths to train an explainable neural network for trait-based multispecies distribution modeling. They emphasized the importance of having a diverse and high-quality input dataset to ensure the model's ability to learn complex interactions and relationships between the input features and the target variable.

Remote sensing data, often provided in raster format, can also be used as input in deep learning pipelines. Deneu et al. (2022) demonstrated that deep-SDMs could construct a feature space with structured functional traits and bioclimatic preferences using only remote sensing data. This highlights the potential of deep learning models to learn complex relationships from large and diverse datasets.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline can handle various data formats, such as images, audio, video, and CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific problem and the available input data. In the context of species distribution modeling, presence-only data or remote sensing data are commonly used, while images are the primary data format for computer vision tasks.
