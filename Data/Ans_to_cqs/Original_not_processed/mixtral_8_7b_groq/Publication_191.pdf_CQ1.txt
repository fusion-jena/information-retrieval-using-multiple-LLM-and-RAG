Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for plant identification. However, it does mention the use of existing datasets in the training process of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These datasets include the PlantClef2015 dataset, which contains around 113,205 images, and other major datasets for images, videos, and languages.

Deep learning techniques, including CNNs, rely on large amounts of training data to optimize their performance. In the context of plant identification, the training data typically consists of leaf images. These images can be collected through various methods, such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets.

Surveys can involve collecting leaf samples from different plant species in a specific geographical area. These samples can then be digitized and used as training data for deep learning models. Sensors, on the other hand, can be used to collect real-time data on plant leaves. For example, hyperspectral sensors can capture detailed information about the spectral reflectance of plant leaves, which can be used as training data for deep learning models.

Public datasets are another important source of training data for deep learning models. These datasets can be created by research institutions, government agencies, or other organizations. For example, the PlantClef2015 dataset was created by the French National Institute for Computer Science and Control (INRIA) and the French National Museum of Natural History (MNHN) for the PlantCLEF 2015 challenge. This dataset contains images of plant leaves from different species, along with annotations and metadata.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for plant identification, it is mentioned that existing datasets are used for training deep CNNs. These datasets can be created through various methods, such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets.
