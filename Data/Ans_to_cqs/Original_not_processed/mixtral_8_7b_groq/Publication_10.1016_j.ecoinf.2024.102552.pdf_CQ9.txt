Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the methods and results of the classification process, as well as potential improvements for historical ecology. However, it does not mention where the data or code for the deep learning pipeline is stored or made available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query. It would be best to contact the authors or look at the published paper for more information.
