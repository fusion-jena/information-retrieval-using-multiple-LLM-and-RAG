The provided context does not contain specific information about data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. However, I can provide a general overview of some common annotation techniques used in deep learning, particularly for computer vision tasks.

Annotation techniques are essential for training deep learning models, as they help in providing labeled data for supervised learning. Some common annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a rectangle (bounding box) around the object of interest in an image. The bounding box contains the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners of the rectangle, which can be used to extract features of the object for training deep learning models.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel of an object in an image, creating a binary mask for each instance of the object. Instance segmentation allows for precise localization and identification of objects, even when they overlap or are in close proximity.
3. Semantic segmentation: Similar to instance segmentation, semantic segmentation labels each pixel in an image, but it does not differentiate between instances of the same object class. Instead, it assigns a class label to each pixel, creating a pixel-wise classification of the image.
4. Landmark annotation: This technique involves identifying and labeling key points or landmarks on objects within an image. Landmark annotation is particularly useful for tasks involving human pose estimation, facial recognition, or object detection in medical images.
5. Line annotation: Line annotation is used for tasks such as road or lane detection in autonomous driving applications. It involves drawing lines along the object of interest, providing a more precise representation than bounding boxes.

These annotation techniques enable deep learning models to learn from labeled data, improving their performance in various computer vision tasks. However, the provided context does not contain specific examples of these techniques being used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned.
