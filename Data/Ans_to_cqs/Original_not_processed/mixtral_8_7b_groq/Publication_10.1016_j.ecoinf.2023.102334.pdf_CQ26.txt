The provided context discusses various topics related to deep learning, including L2 regularization, Vision Transformers (ViT), and the use of Transformers in different fields. However, it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

Data bias can occur due to various reasons, such as unequal representation of classes, insufficient data, or unrepresentative data samples. To address these issues, several techniques can be employed during the preprocessing stage:

1. **Stratified splitting**: This technique ensures that the train and test datasets have a similar distribution of classes. It is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

2. **Oversampling**: In oversampling, instances from the minority class are replicated to balance the class distribution. This can help the model learn better representations of the minority class.

3. **Undersampling**: Undersampling involves reducing the number of instances from the majority class to balance the class distribution. However, this technique may result in loss of information.

4. **Diverse data collection**: Collecting data from various sources, domains, or demographics can help reduce bias by ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population.

While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, they are commonly used in the preprocessing stage of deep learning pipelines to address data bias. It is essential to consider these techniques when working with real-world datasets to ensure that the model's performance is not affected by data bias.
