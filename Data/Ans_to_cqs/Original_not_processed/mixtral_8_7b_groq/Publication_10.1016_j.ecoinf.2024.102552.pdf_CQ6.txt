The provided context discusses the process of image classification for ecological informatics, but it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, based on common practices in deep learning and remote sensing, we can infer some possible preprocessing steps.

Preprocessing is a crucial step in deep learning model training, especially for remote sensing data like imagery. These steps can include data normalization, scaling, cleaning, and other transformations to make the data suitable for model training.

1. Data Normalization: This process involves scaling the data to a common range, often between 0 and 1. This is important because deep learning models are sensitive to the scale of input features. Different sensors and imaging conditions can result in varying data ranges, making normalization essential for comparability.

2. Data Scaling: While normalization changes the range of data, scaling maintains the original range but shifts it to a common scale. This can be useful when certain features have naturally larger or smaller values than others.

3. Data Cleaning: This step involves removing noise, filling gaps, and correcting inconsistencies in the data. For remote sensing data, this might include removing clouds, correcting atmospheric effects, or dealing with sensor errors.

4. Other Transformations: Depending on the specific task and data, other transformations might be necessary. For example, principal component analysis (PCA) can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the data, making it easier for models to learn.

Given the context, it's likely that the authors applied some or all of these steps to their data before training their models. However, the specific steps are not mentioned. Therefore, while we can infer these common preprocessing steps, the exact procedures used in this study remain unknown.
