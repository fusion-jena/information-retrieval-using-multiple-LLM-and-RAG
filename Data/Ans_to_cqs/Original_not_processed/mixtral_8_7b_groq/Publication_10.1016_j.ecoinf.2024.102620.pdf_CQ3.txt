I don't have the information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the provided context. The context focuses on the introduction and methodology of the PLUS model for land use change prediction, along with the data sources and their spatial resolutions. However, I can provide a brief overview of some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning, especially for computer vision tasks:

1. **Bounding box annotation:** This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in an image. It helps deep learning models to locate and classify objects within the image. Bounding box annotation is widely used for object detection tasks.

2. **Semantic segmentation:** In this method, each pixel in an image is assigned a class label, creating a pixel-wise classification of the image. Semantic segmentation is useful for understanding the composition and context of objects within an image.

3. **Instance segmentation:** Instance segmentation combines object detection and semantic segmentation. It not only classifies each pixel but also distinguishes between instances of the same class. This technique is helpful for counting and tracking individual objects within an image.

4. **Panoptic segmentation:** Panoptic segmentation is a unified framework that combines semantic and instance segmentation. It classifies and distinguishes between instances of all objects within an image, providing a comprehensive understanding of the image content.

5. **Keypoint annotation:** This technique involves annotating specific points or landmarks on objects within an image. Keypoint annotation is often used for human pose estimation, facial landmark detection, and object tracking.

These are some of the common data annotation techniques used in deep learning. However, the specific techniques used in a deep learning pipeline depend on the task and the dataset at hand.
