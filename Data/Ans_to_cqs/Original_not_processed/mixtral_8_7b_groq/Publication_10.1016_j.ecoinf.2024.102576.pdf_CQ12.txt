Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a U-Net model, which is a specific type of convolutional neural network (CNN). This model performs classification through supervised learning, and it was trained using both training and validation data. The U-Net model is particularly suitable for land-cover classification and the extraction of ecological information, as demonstrated by its exceptional performance in image classification across various scientific fields. The availability of labeling data is crucial for U-Net model applications, and the classification accuracy and performance of this model improve as data increases during the training of a deep learning model using satellite imagery over multiple periods. In the context of North Korea, where there is no official land-cover map based on national-scale field data, the U-Net model can still classify land-cover elements based on phenological characteristics and relevant classes.
