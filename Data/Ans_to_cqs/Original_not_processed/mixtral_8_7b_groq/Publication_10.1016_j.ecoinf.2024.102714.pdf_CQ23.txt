The text provided does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it does discuss the development and validation of a machine learning model using the XGBoostClassifier algorithm. While the measures taken might differ slightly from what one would typically employ in a deep learning model, there are still some relevant steps taken to ensure the model's generalizability.

Answer:
The machine learning model's generalizability was addressed through several measures. First, the training and testing datasets were generated by referencing existing field datasets and very high resolution (VHR) images. Areas dominated by target communities were digitized as polygons, and pixels were extracted. These polygons were then split into calibration and validation sets, with approximately 30% of pixels reserved for independent model validation. Splitting polygons rather than pixels minimized the effect of spatial autocorrelation on model accuracies.

Second, the model was trained using a diverse set of features. These included seasonal vegetation index composites from Sentinel-2 (S2), backscatter composites from Sentinel-1 (S1), elevation, and slope. This combination of remote sensing data and topographical information resulted in a total of 54 features, providing the model with a rich and varied input dataset.

Third, the model's applicability was tested at both the local and national levels. A dedicated survey of vegetated semi-natural habitats in Pembrokeshire County was conducted in 2022, and a stratified random sampling method was used to generate sampling points. This approach allowed for a more representative and unbiased assessment of the model's performance.

Lastly, the model's accuracy was assessed by comparing it to the GMEP dataset, which is the only recent field survey for habitats available across Wales. Although inconsistencies between the GMEP and Phase-1 taxonomy posed a challenge, the LWHabmod was clipped with the harmonized GMEPmod squares, and 15 classes were compared, excluding calcareous grassland and raised bog due to their marginal coverage in GMEP.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention deep learning, it does discuss several measures that contribute to the generalizability of a machine learning model, including a diverse dataset, the use of various features, and testing at both local and national levels.
