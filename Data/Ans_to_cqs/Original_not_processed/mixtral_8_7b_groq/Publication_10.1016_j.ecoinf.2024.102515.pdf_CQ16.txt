Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in the methodology described. However, it is mentioned that a training dataset has been made available, which could be used for learning and conducting experiments.

In general, there are several common criteria used to determine when training is complete in machine learning models. One common criterion is when the validation loss plateaus, which means that the loss function (a measure of the difference between the predicted and actual values) stops decreasing or decreases very slowly even with further training. This indicates that the model has likely learned the underlying patterns in the training data and further training is unlikely to improve its performance.

Another criterion is early stopping, which involves stopping the training process before the validation loss plateaus if the loss on a separate validation set starts to increase. This can help prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model becomes too specialized to the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data.

It is also possible to use a combination of criteria, such as a combination of validation loss plateauing and early stopping, to determine when training is complete. The specific criteria used may depend on the characteristics of the data and the goals of the model.

In the context of the study described, it is possible that one or more of these criteria were used to determine when training was complete for the model. However, without more information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
