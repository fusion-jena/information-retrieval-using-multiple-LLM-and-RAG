Based on the provided context, there is no specific information given about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into subsets such as training, validation, and testing. This information is crucial for building and evaluating machine learning models as it helps to assess the model's performance and its ability to generalize to unseen data.

However, there are some common practices for splitting data in deep learning:

1. Random sampling: This method involves randomly dividing the dataset into the desired subsets. It ensures that each subset has a similar distribution of data, reducing the risk of bias.

2. Time-based splitting: In time-series data, it is common to split the data based on time. For example, the oldest data can be used for training, the most recent data for testing, and a subset of the remaining data for validation. This approach ensures that the model is tested on data it has not seen during training.

3. Stratified sampling: When dealing with imbalanced datasets, stratified sampling can be used to ensure that each subset has a similar distribution of classes. This method involves dividing the data based on class labels and then randomly sampling from each stratum.

4. K-fold cross-validation: This technique involves dividing the data into 'k' subsets or folds. The model is then trained on 'k-1' folds, and the remaining fold is used for testing. This process is repeated 'k' times, with a different fold used for testing each time. The average performance across all 'k' runs is used as the final evaluation metric.

Given the context, it is possible that any of these methods were used for splitting the data, but without explicit information, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.
