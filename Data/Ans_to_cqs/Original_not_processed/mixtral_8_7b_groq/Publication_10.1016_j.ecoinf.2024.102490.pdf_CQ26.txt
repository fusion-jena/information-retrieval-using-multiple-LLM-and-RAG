The provided context does not directly discuss data bias techniques used during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some methods and tools used in data processing and analysis related to climatic suitability and species distribution.

When it comes to addressing data bias in a deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed during the preprocessing phase. These techniques include:

1. Stratified splitting: This method involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria, ensuring a balanced representation of these subgroups in both training and testing sets.
2. Oversampling: In cases where certain classes or subgroups are underrepresented, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from these classes or subgroups, ensuring a more balanced dataset.
3. Undersampling: Conversely, if some classes or subgroups have too many instances, undersampling can be used to reduce their representation, again aiming for a more balanced dataset.
4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources and ensuring a diverse representation of the target population can help minimize data bias.

While the context does not explicitly mention these techniques, it does mention tools and methods used in data processing and analysis. For instance, it mentions QGIS, a tool used for cropping bioclimatic layers, and various algorithms and models like XGBOOST, GLM, GAM, SER, FDA, ANN, GBM, RF, MaxEnt, and MARS. These models can help analyze and understand the relationships between variables and the target outcome, potentially aiding in the identification of data bias.

In summary, the provided context does not directly discuss data bias techniques during deep learning preprocessing. However, it does mention tools and methods used in data processing and analysis. The techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
