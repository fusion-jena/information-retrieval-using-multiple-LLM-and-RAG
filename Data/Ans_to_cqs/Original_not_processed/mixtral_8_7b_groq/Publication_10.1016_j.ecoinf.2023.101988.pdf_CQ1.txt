The provided context includes information about various studies and surveys related to ecological management and bioacoustic recordings. However, it does not directly mention a "deep learning pipeline." Therefore, I cannot give a specific answer regarding the methods used for collecting raw data in that context.

However, I can provide some general insights based on the information given:

1. Surveys: In the study "The use of useful bioindicators of mining and grazing impacts in Arid South Australia?" (Zwart et al., 2014), the authors used point-count surveys and observer surveys to collect data on various species. These methods involve direct observation and counting of specific species in a given habitat during a particular season.

2. Automated Bioacoustic Recorders: The study "Automated bioacoustic recorders to replace human wildlife surveys: an example using nightjars" (RStudio Team, 2020) used automated bioacoustic recorders to collect data on nightjar species. This method involves using sensors to record animal sounds automatically, which can then be analyzed to identify and count species.

3. Public Datasets: While not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, public datasets are often used in deep learning pipelines. These datasets can include various types of data, such as images, audio recordings, or sensor readings, and can be used to train and test deep learning models.

In summary, while the provided context does not specifically mention a "deep learning pipeline," it does indicate that surveys and automated bioacoustic recorders are used to collect ecological data. Additionally, public datasets are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, although they are not mentioned in this context.
