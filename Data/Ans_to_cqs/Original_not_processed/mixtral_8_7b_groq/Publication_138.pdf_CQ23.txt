The text provided describes the architecture of a deep learning model called ICSNet, but it does not explicitly mention the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the model. However, it does mention some techniques that were used to improve the model's generalization.

One such technique is the use of Local Response Normalization (LRN) after the pooling layer. LRN normalizes the local response by enhancing larger response values and reducing smaller response values, which can improve the model's generalization.

Another technique used to improve the model's generalization is dropout, which is applied in the tenth layer of the model. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out a fraction of the neurons during training, which helps to prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Additionally, the use of a max pooling operation with a 2x2 window and 2 strides can help to reduce overfitting by reducing the number of parameters in the model.

Furthermore, the authors mention that they adopted the inception module from GoogLeNet, but only built three inception modules in ICSNet. This is a tradeoff between accuracy and time-consuming, which can also help to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, it does describe the use of techniques such as LRN, dropout, max pooling, and a tradeoff between accuracy and time-consuming, which can help to improve the model's generalization.
