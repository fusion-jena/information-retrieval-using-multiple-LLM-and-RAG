Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about a data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the methodology and performance comparison of XGBoost and ANN algorithms in estimating carbon stocks using Planetscope data and vegetation indices in a reforested urban landscape in South Africa. However, it does not mention any data repository or code sharing platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
