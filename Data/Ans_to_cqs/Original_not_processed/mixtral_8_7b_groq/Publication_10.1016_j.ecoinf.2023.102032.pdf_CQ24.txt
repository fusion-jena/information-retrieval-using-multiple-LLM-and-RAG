The provided context does not contain information specific to strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does contain information about the use of machine learning in the context of ecological informatics and remote sensing.

In the article "Improving cloud detection with machine learning" (URL: <https://medium.com/sentinel-hub/improving-cloud-detection-with-machine-learning-c09dc5d7cf13>), the authors discuss the use of machine learning algorithms to improve cloud detection in satellite imagery. While they do not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness, they do note the importance of training data selection and model validation in ensuring the accuracy of their machine learning models.

The article "Assessing wetland use intensity (WUI) in East Africa using Sentinel-2 data" (EcologicalInformatics75(2023)10203216) uses a one-way ANOVA to analyze the distribution of logarithmic WUI values for wetlands under different management categories. While this statistical analysis does not directly relate to deep learning or randomness, it does demonstrate the importance of accounting for variability and distribution in ecological data analysis.

In the context of remote sensing and ecological informatics, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines may involve strategies such as:

1. Fixing the random seed value: This ensures that the same initial weights are used for each training run, allowing for more consistent results.
2. Data augmentation: This involves artificially increasing the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data. This can help reduce overfitting and improve model generalization.
3. Regularization techniques: These methods, such as L1 and L2 regularization, help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.
4. Ensemble methods: These techniques, such as bagging and boosting, involve training multiple models on different subsets of the data and then combining their predictions. This can help reduce the impact of randomness and improve overall model performance.

While the provided context does not directly address the query, these strategies can be employed in the deep learning pipeline to handle randomness and improve model performance.
