Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline for weed detection utilizes image data formats. The "DeepWeeds" dataset, referenced in the Olsen et al. (2019) study, is a multiclass weed species image dataset specifically designed for deep learning applications. This suggests that image data formats are primarily used in this particular deep learning pipeline.

Furthermore, multiple studies listed in the context, such as Dang et al. (2023), Gaidel et al. (2023), GÃ¼ldenring et al. (2023), Kitzler et al. (2023), Olaniyi et al. (2023), Rahman et al. (2022), Rai et al. (2023a), Steininger et al. (2023), Weyler et al. (2023), and many others, focus on image recognition tasks. These studies do not mention the use of audio, video, or CSV data formats in their deep learning pipelines.

However, it is essential to note that the context provided does not explicitly cover all deep learning pipelines for every possible application. While the evidence suggests that image data formats are primarily used in the deep learning pipelines for weed detection, other data formats (e.g., audio, video, CSV) might be used in different deep learning applications.

In summary, the provided context indicates that image data formats are used in deep learning pipelines for weed detection tasks. There is no explicit mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in these pipelines. Nonetheless, this does not rule out the possibility of using other data formats in various deep learning applications.
