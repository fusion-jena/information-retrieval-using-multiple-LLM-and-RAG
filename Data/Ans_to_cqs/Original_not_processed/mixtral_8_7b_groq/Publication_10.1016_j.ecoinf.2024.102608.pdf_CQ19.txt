Based on the provided context, the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models are not mentioned. The text focuses on the methodology used to select hyperparameter values for four machine learning models, one of which is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is a type of deep learning model.

The process of hyperparameter tuning involved using a training and test set approach, analyzing key metrics such as R2, RMSE, and MAE, and employing randomized grid search methods to explore the parameter space. However, the context does not include any details about the deep learning frameworks utilized for building and training the models.

In general, popular deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Caffe, among others. These frameworks provide tools and libraries for designing, training, and implementing deep learning models. Without further information, it is not possible to accurately answer which framework was used in this specific case.
