Based on the provided context, there is no information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context consists of data from GBIF and OBIS used in an ecological informatics study, with a focus on data curation and taxonomic filtering. The table shows the number of records remaining after each filtering step, but it does not provide information about training criteria for machine learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query with the given context.
