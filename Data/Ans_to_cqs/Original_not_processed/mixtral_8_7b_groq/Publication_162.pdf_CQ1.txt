Answer:

The provided context does not give a direct answer to the query, but it does mention some sources of data used in specific deep learning projects related to computer vision and image analysis.

In reference [5], a new LED lamp for collecting nocturnal Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) is presented, implying that images of these insects are used in the study. However, it does not explicitly mention how the images were collected, whether through field surveys or other means.

Reference [6] discusses a method for filtering noisy web data and augmenting fine-grained datasets with selected internet images. This suggests that web data and internet images are used as sources of raw data in this deep learning pipeline.

Reference [33] introduces a dataset called iNaturalist Species Classification and Detection Dataset, which was used in the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) in 2018. This dataset likely contains images of various species of flora and fauna, collected through citizen science efforts.

Therefore, we can infer that deep learning pipelines for computer vision and image analysis may utilize various sources of raw data, including field surveys, sensors, public datasets, web data, and internet images. However, the specific methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline would depend on the specific project and research question.
