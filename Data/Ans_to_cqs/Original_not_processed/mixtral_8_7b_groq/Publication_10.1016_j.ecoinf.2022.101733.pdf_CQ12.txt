Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating that a specific type of deep learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer, is used in the pipeline. The context discusses various studies and methods related to remote sensing and image processing, including the use of machine learning techniques like Support Vector Machines (SVM) for tasks such as glacier segmentation, mapping paddy rice, and microstructure classification. However, it does not mention any deep learning models.

There is a reference to an "optimizer approach for feature selection and optimizing SVM parameters based on a robust system architecture" in the context. This suggests that the focus is on feature selection and optimization for SVM, rather than the use of deep learning models.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
