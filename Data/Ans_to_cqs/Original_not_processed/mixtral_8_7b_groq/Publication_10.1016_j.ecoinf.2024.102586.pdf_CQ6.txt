Answer:::

Based on the information provided, it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention that there were native and alien species pools, and the specimens of alien species belonged to different categories such as cultivated, casual, naturalized, and invasive. It can be inferred that some data cleaning and preparation steps were taken to separate the native species from the alien species and categorize the alien species.

In general, when training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved, such as:

1. Data cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant, missing, or duplicate data that may affect the model's performance.
2. Data normalization or scaling: This is the process of transforming the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is important because deep learning models are sensitive to the scale of the input features.
3. Feature engineering: This involves creating new features from the existing data that can help improve the model's performance. For example, one might create a binary feature indicating whether a species is native or alien.
4. Data splitting: This involves splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken, it is reasonable to assume that some data cleaning and preparation steps were taken before training a deep learning model.
