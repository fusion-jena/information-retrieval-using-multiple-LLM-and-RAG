Answer:::

The raw data used in the deep learning pipeline for farm dam detection was collected using remote sensing satellite images. The study utilized high-definition satellite images to train a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect farm dams across Australia. This information was used to carry out the first continental-scale assessment on the density, distribution, and historical trends of farm dams in the country.

The use of remote sensing data for this study is crucial as it allows for the collection of large-scale and consistent data sets. This method is also non-invasive and cost-effective compared to traditional data collection methods such as surveys or on-ground sensors. Additionally, remote sensing data provides a historical record, enabling the analysis of trends over time.

The study also used various packages in R for data manipulation and plotting, such as sf, raster, ggplot2, rasterVis, and cowplot. These tools were used to process and visualize the satellite image data, as well as to create the confusion matrix for farm dam detection with the deep learning CNN.

Furthermore, the study identified undocumented farm dams using the deep learning CNN, highlighting the importance of remote sensing data in addressing critical global information gaps. The surface area of these unreported dams was estimated to calculate their median water capacity, and examples of such dams were provided in Figure S3.

In summary, the raw data for the deep learning pipeline in this study was collected using remote sensing satellite images. This method allowed for large-scale, consistent, and cost-effective data collection, as well as the ability to analyze historical trends. The use of R packages facilitated data manipulation and visualization, and the deep learning CNN was used to identify undocumented farm dams, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of farm dam distribution and density in Australia.
