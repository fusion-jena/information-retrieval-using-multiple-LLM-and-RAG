Answer: The text provided discusses the use of deep learning for image processing in the context of herbarium sheets, but it does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in deep learning, it can be inferred that methods such as dropout and L2 regularization might have been employed.

Dropout is a regularization technique used during training to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out, or "turning off", neurons in a layer of the neural network. This helps to ensure that the network does not become too reliant on any single neuron, thereby improving its ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is another technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to keep its weights small, which can help to prevent it from fitting the training data too closely and improve its ability to generalize.

The text mentions that transfer learning was used to initialize the model weights, which can also help to prevent overfitting. By using pre-trained weights that have been trained on a large and diverse dataset, such as ImageNet, the model is able to learn more generalizable features in its early layers, which can then be fine-tuned for the specific task at hand.

Finally, the choice of a small minibatch size can also help to prevent overfitting. By using a smaller minibatch size, the model is exposed to a wider variety of training examples during each training iteration, which can help to ensure that it does not become too specialized to the specific examples in its training set.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting, it can be inferred that techniques such as dropout, L2 regularization, transfer learning, and the choice of a small minibatch size may have been employed.
