Answer:::

The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the ResNet-34 model, which is a variant of the ResNet (Residual Network) family widely used for deep learning tasks, was used. These models are often pre-trained on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet, a dataset commonly used for image recognition tasks.

Moreover, the dataset used in this study is not a standard dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it is a dataset of images from a three-month span (March, September, and October 2015) across three environments. This dataset was tripled by incorporating multi-temporal data for each transect, resulting in a total of 18 folders, one for each of the 450 m transects (150 m x 3).

Furthermore, the authors expanded their dataset by using a Convolutional Autoencoder and its variations to extract the most critical features and minimize noise within the training data. This resulted in a compact and informative feature matrix, which was subsequently fed into the PLSR or any regression model. The final matrix was transformed into a vector representing each image with over 8000 values, each one representing one variable as a tabular form.

Therefore, while the specific datasets used are not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that the pipeline used a combination of a pre-trained ResNet-34 model, a custom dataset of images from three environments, and a Convolutional Autoencoder for feature extraction.
