Answer:::

The text provides information on the optimization techniques applied in a specific deep learning pipeline that uses the mxnet package to fit SNN, DNN, and CNN models for species distribution modeling.

In this pipeline, a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm with a momentum of 0.9 is used to train the models. The momentum term helps accelerate learning by accumulating the gradient history, which can lead to faster convergence and better optimization. The batch-size used is 50, which means that at each iteration, 50 samples are randomly chosen from the training dataset to compute the gradient.

Additionally, the text mentions the use of the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, which has been helpful in optimizing neural networks. ReLU addresses the vanishing gradient problem that was prevalent in earlier activation functions like the sigmoid function. ReLU does not saturate for positive input values, allowing for efficient gradient computation and faster learning.

Another optimization technique mentioned in the text is Batch-Normalization. Batch-Normalization is used to reduce internal covariate shift, which occurs when simultaneous changes in all parameters lead to significant changes in the distribution of each activation across the dataset. By normalizing the inputs of each layer, Batch-Normalization helps maintain a stable distribution of activations, improving learning efficiency and reducing training time.

The text also highlights the importance of choosing an appropriate initial learning rate for optimization. A learning rate that is too large can cause training loss divergence, while a learning rate that is too small can result in slow learning. However, the text mentions that there is still work to be done on developing a quick automated procedure for tuning optimization hyper-parameters, especially the initial learning rate.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline described in the text uses SGD with momentum, ReLU activation function, Batch-Normalization, and careful selection of the initial learning rate as optimization techniques. These techniques help improve learning efficiency, convergence, and model interpretability.
