Answer:::

Based on the information provided, the context discusses the hyperparameters tuned for various algorithms, including a deep learning model - Artificial Neural Network (ANN). However, the specific hyperparameters mentioned for the ANN are related to its architecture, such as the number of hidden layers, neurons per layer, threshold, and the number of nearest neighbors (k).

Hyperparameters unique to deep learning models, such as learning rate and optimizer, are not explicitly mentioned in the table. Therefore, we cannot definitively answer this question using the given context.

Learning rate is a crucial hyperparameter in deep learning models that determines the size of the steps in the gradient descent algorithm while optimizing the model's weights and biases. Commonly used optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, Adam, and RMSprop. These optimizers help find the optimal set of weights and biases by minimizing the loss function.

In conclusion, while the table provides information on various hyperparameters for different algorithms, it does not explicitly mention the learning rate and optimizer for the Artificial Neural Network. Thus, we cannot provide a precise answer based on the given context.
