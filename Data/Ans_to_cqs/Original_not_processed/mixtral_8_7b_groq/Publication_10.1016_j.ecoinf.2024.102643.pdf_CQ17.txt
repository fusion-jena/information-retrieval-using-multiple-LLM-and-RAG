The provided context does not include information about deep learning pipelines or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given context.

However, I can provide some general information about the mentioned concepts. Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models, including deep learning. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization introduces a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.

Dropout is a regularization technique specifically designed for neural networks. It randomly drops out, or sets to zero, a fraction of the neurons in each layer during training. This prevents the neurons from co-adapting too much to the training data and reduces overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term proportional to the sum of the squares of the model's weights to the loss function. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, which reduces the capacity of the model and prevents overfitting.

In summary, while the provided context does not contain information about the regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, dropout and L2 regularization are two common techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models.
