Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on the discussion of minimizing biased training of machine learning models with clustered data, and it does not mention any details about the hardware resources used for training deep learning models.

However, it is important to note that deep learning models typically require significant computational resources for training, and high-performance hardware such as graphics processing units (GPUs) or tensor processing units (TPUs) are commonly used to accelerate the training process. GPUs and TPUs are specialized hardware designed to handle the massive parallel computations required for deep learning models, and they can significantly reduce the training time compared to using only CPUs.

Therefore, while the provided context does not mention any specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, it is reasonable to assume that high-performance hardware such as GPUs or TPUs were used to accelerate the training process.
