The text provided does not give specific information about which deep learning framework was used to build the model. It only mentions that the model was trained using the Adam optimizer, which is an optimization algorithm and not a deep learning framework. Deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras provide a structure for building and training neural networks, and they include various optimization algorithms like Adam. However, the text does not specify which framework was used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
