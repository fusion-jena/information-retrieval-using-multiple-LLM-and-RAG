Answer:::

The data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the text is satellite imagery. The study employed the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, which provides a public catalog of petabytes of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. Specifically, Landsat images were used for the initial land-use and land-cover (LULC) classification. These images were first classified using an unsupervised clustering algorithm in GEE, which segmented each image into 10 classes based on RGB, near infrared, and shortwave infrared bands. These cluster images were then utilized to select suitable locations for training sites for the supervised classification. Additionally, cloud masks were created for each image based on image quality bands to support the decision on suitable training sites and to mask the clouds in the LULC maps. Therefore, the data format in this deep learning pipeline is satellite imagery, which includes Landsat images and cloud masks.
