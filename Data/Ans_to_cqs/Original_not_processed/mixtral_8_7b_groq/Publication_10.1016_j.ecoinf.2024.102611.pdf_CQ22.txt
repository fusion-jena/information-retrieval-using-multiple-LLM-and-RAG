Answer: The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are presented in Table 6, which compares the performance of a baseline hierarchical classification model on a validation set (INT-TS-GSL100) and a test set. The table displays the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for five groups (G1, G2, G3, G4, and G5) in both the validation and test sets.

Additionally, the fig. 6 provides a visual representation of the model's performance, comparing the accuracy of validation and test sets for class labels C1 to C50 and C51 to C100, with and without convolution features. The figure also shows the measure of precision, recall, and F1-score with and without the fusion of convolution features.

The comparative analysis presented in the study further highlights the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical classification model with a fusion of convolution features with other machine learning features. The analysis shows that the proposed model produces an accuracy of 94.54% towards test sets and 93.96% towards validation sets, outperforming other features such as geometric, multispectral, texture, shape, and convolution features. The texture features are identified as the poorly performing feature representations, with validation accuracy of 19.14% and 20.52% for test sets.

In summary, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, and the study shows that the proposed hierarchical classification model with a fusion of convolution features outperforms other features in terms of accuracy.
