Answer:::
The code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study "Automatic standardized processing and identification of tropical bat calls using deep learning approaches" is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The study mentions the use of a self-developed open-source software called Waveman, but it does not provide information on where the code for this software or the deep learning pipeline can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific location such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket where the code repository is available. It is possible that the code repository is not publicly available. If you are interested in accessing the code, I would recommend contacting the authors of the study directly for more information.
