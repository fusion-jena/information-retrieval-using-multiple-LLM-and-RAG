Answer:::
The deep learning model for this experiment was built using PyTorch. This information is provided in the context when it lists the Python packages used in the project. It states that PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) was one of the packages used. Other packages listed include TorchAudio, TorchVision, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and tqdm, but there is no mention of other deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow. Therefore, it can be concluded with confidence that PyTorch was the framework used for building the deep learning model in this experiment.
