Answer:::

The specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models in the provided sources are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that they likely used powerful computational resources such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to handle the large datasets and complex computations involved in training deep learning models.

For instance, He et al. (2016) presented a deep residual learning method for image recognition, which requires significant computational power for training. Although they did not specify the hardware used, it is common practice to use GPUs for training deep neural networks.

Kahl et al. (2021) developed BirdNET, a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring, which also involves processing large datasets of bird vocalizations. While they did not explicitly mention the hardware used for training, they cited a study by Tolkova et al. (2021) that used GPUs for training deep audio embeddings.

Moreover, the use of GPUs or TPUs for deep learning model training is standard in the field, as these hardware resources can significantly speed up the training process compared to using CPUs alone. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that such resources were used in the studies mentioned above.
