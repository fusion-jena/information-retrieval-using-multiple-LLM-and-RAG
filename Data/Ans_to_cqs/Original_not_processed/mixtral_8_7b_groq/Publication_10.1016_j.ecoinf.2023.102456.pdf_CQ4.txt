Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the described deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the use of a neural network in the context of learning neighborhood relationships for a model, but it does not discuss data augmentation techniques.

Data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to increase the size and diversity of the training set, and improve the model's ability to generalize. Some common data augmentation techniques include:

* Flipping: creating new training examples by horizontally flipping the original images. This can help the model learn to be invariant to left-right orientation.
* Rotating: creating new training examples by rotating the original images. This can help the model learn to be invariant to orientation.
* Scaling: creating new training examples by scaling the original images. This can help the model learn to be invariant to size.

These techniques are used to create new training examples by applying random transformations to the original images. This can help the model learn to be more robust to variations in the input data, and improve its ability to generalize to new, unseen examples.

In summary, based on the provided context, there is no information about the use of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the described deep learning pipeline. However, data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to increase the size and diversity of the training set, and improve the model's ability to generalize.
