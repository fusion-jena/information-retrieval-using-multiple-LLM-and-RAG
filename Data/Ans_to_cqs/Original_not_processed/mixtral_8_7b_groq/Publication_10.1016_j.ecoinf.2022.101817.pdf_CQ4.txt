The provided context does not contain specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for any of the mentioned studies. However, it is common practice to use data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling in deep learning pipelines for image analysis. These techniques help to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize.

For instance, in the study by Rathi et al. (2017) on underwater fish species classification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the authors mention using a dataset of 10,000 images, but they do not specify if any data augmentation techniques were applied. Similarly, in the study by Salman et al. (2019) on real-time fish detection in complex backgrounds, the authors mention using a dataset of 1,500 images but again do not specify if any data augmentation techniques were used.

However, in the study by Sharma et al. (2016) on fish counting from underwater video sequences, the authors mention using color and texture features for fish detection. They do not explicitly mention data augmentation techniques, but they do mention using a dataset of 1,200 frames from underwater videos. It is possible that they used data augmentation techniques to increase the size of their dataset.

In summary, while the provided context does not contain specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines of the mentioned studies, it is common practice to use techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset.
