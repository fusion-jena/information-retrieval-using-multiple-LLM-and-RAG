The provided context discusses a study that uses an ensemble modeling approach in the BIOMOD2 package in R to predict the distribution of a study species. The models used include one regression-based model and three machine-learning models (MaxEnt, RF, and SVM). The models' performance is tested using cross-validation and the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) as the accuracy index. The study also mentions the use of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) for predicting climate change under different greenhouse gas emission trajectories. However, the context does not provide information on the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
