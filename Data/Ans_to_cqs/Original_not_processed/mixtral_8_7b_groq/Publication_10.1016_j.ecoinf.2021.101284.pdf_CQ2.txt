Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study is based on analyzing the course of COVID-19 cases, and it uses a deep learning algorithm to diagnose COVID-19 patients based on X-ray and computed tomography (CT) images. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data formats used in this particular deep learning pipeline include medical imaging data such as X-ray and CT scans.

Additionally, the context also mentions that the study uses statistical analysis and machine learning tools, which suggests that other data formats such as CSV or other tabular data formats may also be used in the pipeline. However, the specific data formats are not mentioned.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that medical imaging data such as X-ray and CT scans are used based on the study's focus on diagnosing COVID-19 patients. Other data formats such as CSV or tabular data may also be used, but the specific data formats are not mentioned.
