Answer:::

The provided context discusses active learning procedures for training models, particularly in the context of deep learning and camera trap data. However, it does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation).

In general, when training deep learning models, the data is typically split into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model's parameters. The validation set is used during the training process to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance and to tune hyperparameters. The testing set, which is independent of the training and validation sets, is used to assess the model's generalization performance.

The context focuses on an active learning procedure, which is a special case of machine learning where the goal is to select the most informative samples to be labeled by an oracle (e.g., a human annotator). Active learning strategies usually start by training the underlying model on a small, randomly selected labeled set of data samples. After training the initial model, various criteria can be employed to select the most informative unlabeled samples to be passed to the oracle for labelling.

In the context of the paper, the authors use margin-based active learning and report the classifier's performance after the first 30,000 active queries. However, the criteria used for splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets are not specified in the given text.
