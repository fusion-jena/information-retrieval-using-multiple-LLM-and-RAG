Answer:::

The performance of the deep learning model in the given context is evaluated using two metrics: accuracy and precision.

Accuracy is a measure of the model's ability to correctly classify both classes. It is calculated as the sum of true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN) divided by the total number of signals (N). True positives refer to the number of correct classifications of one class, while true negatives refer to the number of correct rejections of the other class. The total number of signals (N) is the sum of true positives, true negatives, false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). Accuracy provides a general idea of the model's performance but can be misleading if the classes are imbalanced.

Precision, on the other hand, measures the model's ability to classify one specific class, in this case, boatwhistle calls. It is calculated as the number of true positives (TP) divided by the sum of true positives and false positives (FP). False positives refer to the number of incorrect classifications of the class of interest. Precision is a useful metric when the cost of false positives is high, as it provides a measure of the model's performance in identifying the class of interest.

The deep learning model's performance is evaluated using these metrics on a test dataset that was not seen during training. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.0% and a precision of 98.4%, indicating a high level of performance in detecting and classifying both classes.

It is worth noting that other metrics, such as recall and F1-score, could also have been used to evaluate the model's performance. Recall measures the model's ability to identify all instances of the class of interest, regardless of false positives. It is calculated as the number of true positives (TP) divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN). The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a balanced measure of the model's performance in identifying and classifying the class of interest. However, these metrics are not mentioned in the provided context.
