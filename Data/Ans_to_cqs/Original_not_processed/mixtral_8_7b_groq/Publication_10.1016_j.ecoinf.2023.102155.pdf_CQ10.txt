Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context mainly focuses on the "ppmlasso" package and its associated functions, which is an R package for fitting spatial econometric models using Lasso and Post-Lasso methods.

The context includes details about various arguments and parameters used in the "ppmlasso" package, as well as the "ppmlassoLoopEngine" function, which applies loop methods with extensions. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or any code repository link.

Therefore, I am unable to provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the given context.
