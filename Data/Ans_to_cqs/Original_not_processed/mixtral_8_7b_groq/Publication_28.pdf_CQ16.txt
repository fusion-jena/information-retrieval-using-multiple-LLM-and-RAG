Answer:

The context provided does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the PTDLEN-VAE model. However, it is common in machine learning and deep learning models to use a validation loss plateau as a criterion to determine when training is complete. This means that training continues until the validation loss stops decreasing or starts increasing, indicating that the model is starting to overfit the training data.

In the context of the PTDLEN-VAE model, the training process includes pre-processing, EfficientNet-based feature extraction, IKHO-based parameter optimization, and VAE-based classification. The IKHO algorithm is used to optimize the parameters of the EfficientNet model used in the feature extractor, which is based on PTDLEN. This feature extractor is designed to enhance the prediction outcome of the PTDLEN-VAE model for unseen data.

After the training process, the performance of the PTDLEN-VAE model is validated on a benchmark aerial image dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the supremacy of the proposed PTDLEN-VAE model over other techniques in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and F2-score.

Therefore, while the specific criterion used to determine when training is complete for the PTDLEN-VAE model is not provided, it is likely that a validation loss plateau was used, as is common in deep learning models.
