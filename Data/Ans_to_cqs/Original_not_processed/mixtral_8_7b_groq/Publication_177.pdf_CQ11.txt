Answer:

The provided context does not give information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It contains details about various studies and models developed for plant identification using deep learning techniques, but it does not mention where the data used in these studies is stored or how to access it.

The studies mentioned in the context use different datasets for training and testing their models. For instance, Wu et al. [23] used the PlantCLEF 2017 dataset, Haupt et al. [24] used the LifeCLEF 2015 dataset, Lasseck [25] used an unspecified dataset, and Å ulc and Matas [27] used the Plant CLEF 2016 dataset. However, the context does not provide any information about where these datasets can be accessed or downloaded.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific link to the data repository based on the given context. If you are interested in accessing the datasets used in these studies, you may need to contact the authors directly or search for the datasets on the respective websites of the competitions or challenges mentioned in the context.
