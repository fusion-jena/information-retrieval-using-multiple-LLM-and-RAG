The provided context does not include information on the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model for object recognition and categorization, particularly in the classification of land use/land cover (LULC) and forest types.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for object recognition and categorization include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image. It is commonly used for object detection tasks, where the goal is to locate and identify objects within an image.
2. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class label. It is commonly used for image segmentation tasks, where the goal is to partition an image into multiple regions or segments, each corresponding to a specific object or class.
3. Instance segmentation: This technique combines object detection and semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and labeled individually. It is commonly used for tasks that require identifying and tracking individual objects within an image or video sequence.

The choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the desired output. For example, if the goal is to detect and count the number of trees in a forest image, bounding box annotation may be sufficient. However, if the goal is to segment and classify each individual tree species, instance segmentation may be more appropriate.

In the context of the XGBoost model, the data annotation technique used would depend on the specific LULC or forest type classification task. For example, if the goal is to classify forest types based on image features, semantic or instance segmentation may be used to label each pixel or instance of a forest type. However, if the goal is to detect and count the number of forest types within an image, bounding box annotation may be sufficient.

Overall, while the provided context does not specify the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is important to choose the appropriate technique based on the specific task and desired output.
