Answer:::

In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the issue of overfitting and the importance of preventing it in the context of machine learning modeling.

Overfitting is a common issue in machine learning where a model learns the training data too well, including the noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. To prevent overfitting, various regularization techniques can be used, including dropout and L2 regularization, which are commonly used in deep learning.

Dropout is a regularization technique used in neural networks where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training. This helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons and promoting the learning of more robust features.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a technique that adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which can help to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention these regularization techniques, they are commonly used methods to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines.
