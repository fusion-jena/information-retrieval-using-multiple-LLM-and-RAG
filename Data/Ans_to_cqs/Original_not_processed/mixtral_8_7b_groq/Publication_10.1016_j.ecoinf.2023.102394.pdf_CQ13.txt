The specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model described in the text are not provided in the given context. However, it is mentioned that the parameter selection for the model was performed by minimizing the mean squared error. This implies that the optimization process of the model involved tuning various hyperparameters to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual values.

The deep learning algorithm used in this study is the multilayer perceptron (MLP), which is a type of feedforward artificial neural network. The MLP model consists of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer, except for the input layer, consists of a set of individual nodes (neurons) that connect adjacent layers via an activation function.

In general, MLP models have several hyperparameters that can be tuned to optimize the model's performance. These hyperparameters include the learning rate, the number of hidden layers, the number of nodes in each layer, the activation function, the optimization algorithm, and the batch size.

The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls the size of the steps taken during the optimization process. A high learning rate may result in large steps that could overshoot the optimal solution, while a low learning rate may result in slow convergence.

The number of hidden layers and the number of nodes in each layer determine the complexity of the model. A higher number of layers and nodes can increase the model's capacity to learn complex patterns but may also increase the risk of overfitting.

The activation function determines the output of each node in the model. Common activation functions include the sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU functions.

The optimization algorithm is used to update the model's weights during the training process. Common optimization algorithms include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.

The batch size determines the number of samples used to calculate the gradient during each iteration of the optimization process.

While the specific hyperparameters used in the model described in the text are not provided, it is clear that the model's performance was optimized through a parameter selection process that involved minimizing the mean squared error.
