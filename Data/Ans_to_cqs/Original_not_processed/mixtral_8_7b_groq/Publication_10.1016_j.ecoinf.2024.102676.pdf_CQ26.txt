The provided context discusses the use of data preprocessing techniques in the Footprint Identification Technique (FIT) method, but it does not explicitly mention the strategies for addressing data bias during deep learning pipeline preprocessing such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does mention the use of mean imputation and tree-based nonparametric imputation methods like missForest, missRanger or MICE RF for handling missing values.

To address data bias during preprocessing, there are several techniques that can be employed:

1. **Stratified sampling**: This technique involves dividing the data into strata based on specific characteristics, and then ensuring that each stratum is proportionally represented in both the training and testing datasets. This can help to ensure that the model is exposed to a diverse range of examples and is not biased towards any particular subgroup.

2. **Oversampling**: In cases where certain classes are underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to increase the number of examples from these classes. This can help to prevent the model from being biased towards the more common classes.

3. **Undersampling**: Conversely, if certain classes are overrepresented in the dataset, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of examples from these classes. This can help to prevent the model from being overfit to these classes.

4. **Diverse data collection**: Collecting data from a wide range of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the target population can help to prevent bias. This may involve actively seeking out examples from underrepresented groups or ensuring that the data collection process is unbiased.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques for addressing data bias during deep learning pipeline preprocessing, it does discuss the use of mean imputation and tree-based nonparametric imputation methods for handling missing values. To address data bias, techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be employed.
