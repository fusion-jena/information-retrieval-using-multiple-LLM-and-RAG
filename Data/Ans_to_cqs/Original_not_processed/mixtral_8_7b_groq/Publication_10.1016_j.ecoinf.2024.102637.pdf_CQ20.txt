The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mainly focuses on the AlexNet network's design and the proposed SIAlex model's lightweight and efficient features. However, it can be inferred that generally, high-performance hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are used for deep learning model training due to their ability to handle large computations and data sets more efficiently than CPUs. These hardware resources can significantly speed up the training process, especially for complex and deep models. Therefore, while the text does not explicitly mention the hardware, it is highly likely that similar high-performance hardware is used for training the models in this context as well.
