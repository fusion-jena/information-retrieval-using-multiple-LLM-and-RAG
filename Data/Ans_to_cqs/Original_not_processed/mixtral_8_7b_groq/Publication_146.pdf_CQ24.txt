Answer:::

The text provided does not give specific details about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention that the Adam learning rate optimizer was chosen over the static stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for model training. The Adam optimizer is an adaptive learning rate algorithm that helps reduce randomness by adjusting the learning rate based on the historical gradient, which can help improve model accuracy.

In addition, the hyperparameter setting for the model was based on studies that successfully implemented Yolo in remote sensing cases, and the author of the Yolo-based "Yolt" model suggests implementing the same hyperparameters as the Yolo model. This suggests that the hyperparameters were carefully chosen and possibly fine-tuned to minimize the impact of randomness on model performance.

Furthermore, the text mentions that data augmentation was not used in this study, but it is known to be a common strategy to handle randomness in deep learning. Data augmentation involves creating new training samples by applying random transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping. This can help improve model performance by increasing the size and diversity of the training set, reducing overfitting, and improving the model's ability to generalize.

Overall, while the text does not provide specific details about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest that adaptive learning rate algorithms and careful hyperparameter tuning were used to minimize the impact of randomness on model performance. However, the use of data augmentation, a common strategy to handle randomness, was not mentioned in this study.
