Answer:::

 The provided context does not give information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It focuses on the use of Vision Transformer (ViT) models for birdsong classification, the data preprocessing steps, and the audio augmentation techniques employed.

 The data preprocessing includes the utilization of the 2021 BirdCLEF dataset with its recordings, which are weakly labeled. Randomly selected chunks with a length of 5 seconds are used for the training process, and additional noise from AudioSet is deployed to diversify non-bird audio events. However, the context does not mention any specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or others.

 Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
