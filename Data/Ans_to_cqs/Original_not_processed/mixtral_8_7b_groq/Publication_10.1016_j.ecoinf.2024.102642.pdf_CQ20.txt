Answer:::
The provided context does not give information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It mentions the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the training process, but it does not specify whether GPUs, TPUs, or any other hardware accelerators were used. The focus of the context is on the methods used to assess inter-annotator variability, the impact of annotation discrepancies, and the proposed annotation aggregation methods. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
