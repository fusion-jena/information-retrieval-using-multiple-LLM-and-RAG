Answer:::

The text provided does not give a detailed description of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was retrained using new images. This retraining could have involved model serialization, which is the process of saving the model architecture and weights so that it can be loaded and used later.

The platform for deployment is also not specified. The model was developed using R and the keras package, which is an interface to TensorFlow. These are both open-source software libraries, so the model could potentially be deployed on any platform that supports R and TensorFlow.

Additionally, the text mentions that the model was used with a camera trap system. This suggests that the model was deployed in an embedded system or an edge computing device, which is a device that can run machine learning models locally, without the need for a constant connection to a remote server.

In summary, while the text does not provide a detailed description of the deployment process, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized, and deployed on a platform that supports R and TensorFlow, possibly in an embedded system or edge computing device.
