Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include manual visual interpretation and correction of the image classification results for mangroves within a 10-km buffer zone extending inland from the coastline. This step effectively corrected misclassifications between forest and mangroves resulting from "spectral confusion". However, there is no mention of saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix in the provided context.

In the study, training samples were created and landscape types were rapidly extracted using Google Earth Pro. The sample points were then randomly divided into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio. The random forest algorithm was applied to rapidly classify the land use types in the study area.

After the model training, a post-classification processing was applied to the images. A manual visual interpretation approach was used to correct the image classification results for mangroves within a 10-km buffer zone extending inland from the coastline. This procedure effectively corrected misclassifications between forest and mangroves resulting from "spectral confusion".

The accuracy of the model was then evaluated using userâ€™s accuracy, total accuracy, and Kappa coefficient for impervious water surface, water, forest, farmland, mangrove forest, and other. The accuracy assessment was conducted for each year from 1985 to 2020.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include manual visual interpretation and correction of the image classification results for mangroves within a 10-km buffer zone extending inland from the coastline.
