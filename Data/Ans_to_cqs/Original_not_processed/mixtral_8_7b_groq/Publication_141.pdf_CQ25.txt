Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the text is classification. This is evident from the description of the model's architecture, which takes input images and transforms them into a feature vector that is then subject to classification using a fully connected layer. The model uses a softmax function to normalize the output into a probability distribution for each class, which is a common technique in classification problems. The model is used to classify images of chironomid taxa, with 80% of the images used for training and the remaining 20% used for validation. The text also mentions previous studies where deep learning neural networks were applied to various animal taxa for classification, further supporting the conclusion that the model's purpose is classification.
