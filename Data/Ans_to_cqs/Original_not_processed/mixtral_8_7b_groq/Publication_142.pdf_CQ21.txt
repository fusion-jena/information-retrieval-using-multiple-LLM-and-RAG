Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific postprocessing steps involved after model training such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating confusion matrices. However, it is mentioned that an expert assessed each photo using a set of standard questions within a custom RShiny app. These assessments could potentially be used to calculate metrics or create a confusion matrix.

In the context of deep learning, Batch Normalization (arXiv, 1502.03167) is mentioned as a technique used during network training to reduce internal covariate shift. This technique aims to improve the training process and the final model's performance, but it is not a postprocessing step.

The context also discusses the challenges and opportunities of dealing with large, diverse, and heterogeneous data in fields like water management, camera trapping, and acoustic analysis. These challenges include storage, exploration, curation, and revision of data, but they focus on preprocessing and managing data rather than postprocessing trained models.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention specific postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices, it is possible that such steps were taken as part of the expert's assessment within the RShiny app. The main focus of the context, however, is on data management and model training techniques.
