Answer:::

In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is important to note that overfitting is a common issue in deep learning models, where the model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function, which discourages the learning of overly complex models.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are dropped out during training, which helps to prevent over-reliance on any single neuron and encourages the model to learn more robust features. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, which in turn leads to simpler models that are less likely to overfit.

While the context does not explicitly mention these regularization techniques, it does discuss other methods used to improve the performance of deep learning models in remote sensing applications. For example, it mentions the use of batch normalization (BN) to prevent vanishing/exploding gradients in deep CNNs. BN is a technique that normalizes the activations of each layer, which can help to improve the stability and convergence of the training process.

Additionally, the context discusses the use of shallow layers and identity mapping in ResNet to address the degradation problem, where the accuracy of deep CNNs saturates and then degrades during training. By using shallow layers and identity mapping, ResNet is able to train deeper models that are less prone to the degradation problem.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention dropout and L2 regularization, it is important to note that these are common regularization techniques used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. The context does discuss other methods used to improve the performance of deep learning models in remote sensing applications, such as batch normalization and the use of shallow layers and identity mapping in ResNet.
