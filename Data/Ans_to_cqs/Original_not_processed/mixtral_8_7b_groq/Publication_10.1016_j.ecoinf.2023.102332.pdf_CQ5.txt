Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet datasets in relation to deep learning pipelines. However, there are some details about the datasets used in the creation of word embedding spaces.

The WordSpace model mentioned in the context was created using a 2.8-billion-word corpus, which is a concatenation of the ukWaC corpus (web pages material from the .uk domain), Wikipedia, and the British National Corpus (BNC). This model was trained using the CBOW algorithm and contains vectors for 300,000 different words, covering a broad variety of different topics.

In the context of natural language processing and ecological informatics, the datasets used are likely to be text corpora from various sources, such as Twitter data, scientific literature, and other online resources. However, the specific datasets are not mentioned in the provided context.
