Answer:::

The data repository for the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is stated that supplementary data can be found online at <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101786>. It is possible that the data repository is linked from this location. Additionally, the study refers to using the Biigle annotations platform for generating training, validation, and testing datasets (Langenkämper et al., 2017). It is unclear if this platform also serves as the data repository.

It is important to note that the focus of the study is on the application of a deep learning pipeline for identifying and mapping vulnerable habitats in the deep sea, rather than on the data repository itself. As such, the study may not provide extensive details on the data repository.

In general, data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF are commonly used for sharing and preserving research data. These repositories provide a persistent identifier for the dataset, allowing for easy citation and access. It is best practice to deposit datasets in a reputable data repository to ensure their long-term availability and accessibility.

Therefore, while the specific data repository for this study is not mentioned, it is recommended to check the supplementary data link provided in the study and/or contact the authors for more information on the dataset. Additionally, researchers may consider depositing the dataset in a data repository for broader access and reuse.
