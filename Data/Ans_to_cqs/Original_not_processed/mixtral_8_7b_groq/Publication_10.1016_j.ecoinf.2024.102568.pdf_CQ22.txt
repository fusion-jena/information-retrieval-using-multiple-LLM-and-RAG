The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model (LSTM) include Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Relative Error (MRE), and accuracy.

The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) measures the differences between values predicted by the model and the values actually observed. It is calculated as the square root of the mean of the squared differences between the predicted and observed values. RMSE gives a relatively high weight to large errors.

The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) measures the average magnitude of the errors. It is calculated as the mean of the absolute differences between the predicted and observed values. MAE weighs all errors in the same way and without considering the error direction.

The Mean Relative Error (MRE) measures the relative error of the predicted values compared to the actual values. It is calculated as the mean of the absolute differences between the predicted and observed values divided by the actual value.

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. It gives an idea about the significance of the errors in the predicted values.

The LSTM model was evaluated using these metrics for each pollutant in the experiments. In Experiment 1, the LSTM model had a lower RMSE and MAE than the VR + SVR model for all pollutants, except for MRE in one case. The accuracy of the LSTM model was also higher than the VR + SVR model for all pollutants.

In Experiment 3, the LSTM model again had a lower RMSE and MAE than the VR + SVR model for all pollutants, except for MRE in one case. The accuracy of the LSTM model was also higher than the VR + SVR model for all pollutants.

Therefore, the LSTM model showed better performance than the VR + SVR model in predicting pollutant levels using these evaluation metrics.
