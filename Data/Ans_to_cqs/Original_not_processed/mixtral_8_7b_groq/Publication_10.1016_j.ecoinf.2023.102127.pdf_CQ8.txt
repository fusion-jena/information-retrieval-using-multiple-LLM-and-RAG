Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various topics related to species distribution models, ecological modeling, and statistical software packages, but it does not mention any code repository or deep learning pipeline specifically.

The context references several papers and software packages, including "cmdstanr" by CeË‡snovar (2022), "Using species distribution models at local scale to guide the search of poorly known species" by Fois et al. (2018), and "Regularization paths for generalized linear models via coordinate descent" by Friedman et al. (2010). However, none of these references provide information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as the necessary information is not present in the given context.
