Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline used in BirdNET. However, data augmentation is a common practice in deep learning to increase the amount and diversity of training data, improve model performance, and reduce overfitting. Common data augmentation techniques for audio data include:

1. Time stretching: Changing the speed of the audio while preserving its pitch.
2. Pitch shifting: Changing the pitch of the audio while preserving its duration.
3. Adding background noise: Introducing environmental sounds to simulate real-world conditions.
4. Mixing species: Combining recordings of different bird species to create more complex audio scenes.
5. Flipping: Reversing the audio along the time axis.
6. Cropping: Randomly selecting a segment from the audio.
7. Adding reverb: Simulating the effect of sound reflections in different environments.
8. Rotating: Changing the orientation of the audio in 3D space.
9. Scaling: Changing the volume of the audio.

Considering that BirdNET is a deep learning model for bird vocalization detection and classification, it is highly probable that some of these data augmentation techniques were applied during the development of the model. However, the specific techniques used are not mentioned in the provided context.
