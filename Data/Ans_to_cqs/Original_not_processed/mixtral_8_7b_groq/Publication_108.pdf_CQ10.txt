Answer:
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context describes the architecture and workflow of a deep learning pipeline used in a remote sensing study, but it does not give any information about where the code for this pipeline might be found. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to the code repository.
