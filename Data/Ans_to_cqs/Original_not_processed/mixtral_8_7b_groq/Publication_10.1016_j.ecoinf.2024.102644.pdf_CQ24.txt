Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the strategies employed to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines. However, I can provide some general insights into how randomness can be handled in machine learning models, including some that use deep learning techniques.

In the context of MaxEnt, a shallow-machine learning model mentioned in the provided documents, randomness can be handled through various techniques. MaxEnt is a type of species distribution model that estimates the ecological niche of a species based on environmental parameters. Although MaxEnt is not a deep learning model, it shares some similarities with deep learning models in terms of handling randomness.

One way to handle randomness in machine learning models is by setting a random seed value. A random seed value initializes the random number generator used in the model, ensuring that the same sequence of random numbers is produced each time the model is run. This practice can help improve the reproducibility of the model's results.

Another way to handle randomness in machine learning models is through cross-validation. Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a model by dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on one subset, and testing it on another. This process is repeated multiple times, with each subset serving as both the training and testing set. Cross-validation can help reduce the impact of randomness on the model's performance by averaging the results across multiple runs.

In the context of species distribution models like MaxEnt, randomness can also be handled through the use of background data. Background data refers to the set of environmental parameters used to define the range of possible habitats for a species. By randomly selecting background points, the model can account for the variability in environmental conditions across the study area. This practice can help reduce the impact of randomness on the model's predictions.

Finally, it is worth noting that the provided context does not mention deep learning models explicitly. While some of the techniques used to handle randomness in machine learning models may be applicable to deep learning models, there may be additional techniques specific to deep learning that are not covered in the provided context.
