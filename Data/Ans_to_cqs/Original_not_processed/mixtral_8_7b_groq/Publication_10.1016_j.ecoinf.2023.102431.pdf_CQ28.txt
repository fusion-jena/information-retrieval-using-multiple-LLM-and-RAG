Based on the provided context, there is no information available about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the development of non-invasive survey methods for wildlife, specifically using FIT (Furmark Identification Tag) data and camera trap photos to identify species and sex. The authors involved in the study are mentioned, along with their contributions, but there is no mention of any cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform being used for the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
