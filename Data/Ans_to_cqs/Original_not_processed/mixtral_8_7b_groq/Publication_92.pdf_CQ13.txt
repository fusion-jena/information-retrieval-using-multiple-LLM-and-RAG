Answer:::

The provided context discusses a deep learning model used for coral reef fish detection and recognition in underwater videos, but it does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used such as the learning rate or the optimizer. However, it does provide some information about the architecture and training of the model.

The model's architecture is based on the GoogLeNet architecture, which consists of 27 layers, 9 inception layers, and a soft-max classifier. Inception layers are used to reduce the dimension of the picture to one pixel, making the model not dependent on the dimensional impact. The authors mention that they adapted some parameters such as the size of the strides and the first convolutions to the size of their thumbnails, which allowed them to achieve better results than a classic architecture.

The training phase of the model involves sending a list of cropped thumbnails and their labels to the network. The network then optimizes its classification rate during the learning process. The output of a neuron is defined as the activation function applied to the first operation, which is a weighted sum of the inputs to the neuron.

In general, deep learning models have several hyperparameters that can be tuned to improve performance, such as the learning rate, the type of optimizer, the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons in each layer, and the activation function. The learning rate controls how much the weights are updated during training, and the optimizer is a method used to find the optimal weights that minimize the loss function. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent, Adam, and RMSprop.

Therefore, while the specific hyperparameters used in the model are not provided in the context, it is likely that the authors tuned some of these hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and the optimizer, to achieve better results. Without more information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
