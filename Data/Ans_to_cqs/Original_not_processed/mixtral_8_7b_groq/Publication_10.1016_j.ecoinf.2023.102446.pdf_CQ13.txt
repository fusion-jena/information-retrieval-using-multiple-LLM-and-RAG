Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the use of a deep learning model for the analysis. The methods described involve the use of TPINet, a tool for process network generation based on information theory and transfer entropy. The TPINet approach considers surrogates, a significance level of 1%, and lagged information up to 12 time steps (equivalent to 6 hours) for the analysis. The data used in the studies mentioned consisted of at least 200 data points and covered time scales from hourly to daily, over several-day windows.

The context does not include details about hyperparameters typically found in deep learning models, such as learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to specify the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model.
