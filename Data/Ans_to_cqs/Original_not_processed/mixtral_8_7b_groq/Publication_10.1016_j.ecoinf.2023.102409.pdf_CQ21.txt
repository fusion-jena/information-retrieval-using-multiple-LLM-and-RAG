Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps applied after the model training. However, it can be inferred that metrics calculation is one of the steps since it is mentioned that the models' performance is evaluated using iterative testing.

In the context of the first model, the authors mention that the initial learning rate was set to 0.01 and further refined through iterative testing. This process of iterative testing implies that metrics calculation is being used to compare and evaluate the performance of the model with different learning rates.

Similarly, in the context of the second model, the authors mention that the initial learning rate was set to 0.0001 and subsequently fine-tuned through iterative testing. Again, this suggests that metrics calculation is being employed to assess the model's performance with different learning rates.

However, there is no information about other postprocessing steps such as generating saliency maps or creating confusion matrices. Saliency maps are often used to visualize the parts of the input image that the model considers most important for its prediction. A confusion matrix, on the other hand, is a table that is often used to evaluate the performance of a classification model by comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can infer that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps used after model training, but there is no information about other steps such as generating saliency maps or creating confusion matrices.
