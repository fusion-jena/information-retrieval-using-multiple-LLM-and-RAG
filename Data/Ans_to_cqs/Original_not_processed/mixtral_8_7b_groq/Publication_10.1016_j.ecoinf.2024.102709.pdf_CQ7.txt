Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training involved the use of k-fold cross-validation, where the data was divided into k different training-test sets. In this specific case, k was set to 5. This method was chosen to determine the ideal training-test split for the model. The data was not trained on the entire dataset but on each training split, and the results were investigated to find the best data split. The functions of the Python library scikit-learn were used to split the data and evaluate the results of each trained model.

The split with the highest mAP50 value (0.987) was selected as the ideal split for the prediction of the model. The mAP50 value indicates the highest number of correctly predicted labels for the model trained on a specific split. This split was then used for testing the model using unprocessed data, which appeared to be similar to the training data since it consisted of images of the extracted clusters without further processing.

It is worth noting that the dataset used in this study included single-tree point clouds, images of single-trees, and csv files containing the attributes used to produce the images, reference data, clusters of numbers in two different point-thickness settings, labeled numbers, preprocessed images of the numbers, numbers from the best split, and tables containing the results of the digit recognition.

In summary, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training involved the use of k-fold cross-validation, where the data was divided into k different training-test sets, and the best split was selected based on the highest mAP50 value. The ideal split was then used for testing the model using unprocessed data.
