Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context consists of various research papers and figures related to ecological studies, but none of them mention the use of hardware resources for deep learning model training.

Answer:::
However, it is important to note that when training deep learning models, especially those involving large datasets and complex computations, high-performance hardware resources such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are commonly used. These hardware resources can significantly speed up the training process and improve model performance by providing parallel processing capabilities.

Answer:::
Therefore, while the provided context does not specify the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model, it is reasonable to assume that such resources were used given the complexity of deep learning models and the computations involved in the ecological studies mentioned in the context.
