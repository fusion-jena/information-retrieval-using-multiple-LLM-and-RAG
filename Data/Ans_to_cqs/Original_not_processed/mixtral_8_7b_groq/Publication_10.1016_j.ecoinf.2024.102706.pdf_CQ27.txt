Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the deployment of a deep learning model. In fact, it does not mention any deep learning models being used at all. The models mentioned are linear regression, Enet, SVM, RF, XGboost, and LightGBM, which are all machine learning models, not deep learning. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
