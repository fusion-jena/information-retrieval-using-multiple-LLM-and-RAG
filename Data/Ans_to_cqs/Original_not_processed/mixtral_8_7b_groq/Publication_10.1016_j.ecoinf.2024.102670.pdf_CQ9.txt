Based on the provided context, there is no clear information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. None of the sources mentioned in the context have explicitly stated where the data repository is available. It is possible that the data repository is not publicly accessible or has not been specified in the sources provided.

However, some of the sources mentioned have provided information about the datasets used in their research. For example, Sharma et al. (2017) used karyotyping images of chromosomes and demonstrated the efficacy of their method using crowd-sourcing for obtaining manual annotation. Similarly, Gillette et al. (2023) used light microscopy datasets for automated tracing of neurons and created a resource called BigNeuron for benchmarking and predicting the performance of algorithms.

Therefore, while the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, some of the sources have provided information about the datasets used in their research. It is possible that the data repository is associated with one of these sources or is available through a different channel.
