Based on the provided context, there are no specific details about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention that they used Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a reference metric during the training process, and they performed a 10-fold Cross Validation to ensure a reliable estimate of the MSE on the test set. Additionally, they considered the problem's nature and computational resources to ensure an accurate reconstruction of the predicted output distribution with a 95% confidence interval and a precision level of 5%.

The context also mentions that they used two different approaches, MCD and VBI, for uncertainty quantification during the training phase. These approaches might have their own postprocessing steps, but they are not specified in the text.

Therefore, based on the given context, the postprocessing steps after the model training could include:

1. Metrics calculation: Specifically, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) was used as a reference metric during the training process.
2. Uncertainty quantification: The context suggests that they used two different approaches, MCD and VBI, for uncertainty quantification during the training phase. However, the postprocessing steps for these approaches are not specified in the text.

Answer::: The postprocessing steps after the model training, based on the provided context, include metrics calculation, specifically the Mean Squared Error (MSE), and possibly uncertainty quantification using the MCD and VBI approaches. However, there are no specific details about other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix.
