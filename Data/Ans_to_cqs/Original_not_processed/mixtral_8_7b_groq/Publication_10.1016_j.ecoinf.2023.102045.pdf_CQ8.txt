Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a specific code repository where its source code is hosted, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The text discusses the cblindplot package in R, which aims to improve color palettes for color-blind people and can be used to distinguish between minima and maxima in images. However, it does not specify any deep learning pipeline related to this package.

The authors of the paper have contacted developers of other R packages related to mapping biodiversity and species distributions to implement functions for color-blind people. Still, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline in this context.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information about the code repository for a deep learning pipeline.
