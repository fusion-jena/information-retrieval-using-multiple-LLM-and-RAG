The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It focuses more on the structure of the model, the input features, and the comparison between HMM and LSTM methods.

However, it can be inferred that the model is designed to be simple and efficient, suggesting that it could be trained on devices with limited computing power. This might imply that a CPU could be used, but it doesn't rule out the possibility of using more powerful hardware, such as GPUs or TPUs, which are commonly used for deep learning training due to their ability to perform many calculations simultaneously.

In general, the choice of hardware for training deep learning models depends on various factors, including the size and complexity of the model, the amount of data, and the available resources. For large-scale deep learning tasks, GPUs or TPUs are typically used due to their superior computational power compared to CPUs.

So, while the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, it can be speculated that the model could be trained on a variety of hardware resources, depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the training process.
