The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework was used to build the long short-term memory (LSTM) model for predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in water. However, it is mentioned that the programming language used was Python 3.7 (64-bit), and the integrated development environment was Anaconda 3.

Anaconda is a popular data science and machine learning platform that includes several deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. Therefore, it is possible that any of these deep learning frameworks were used to build the LSTM model.

Moreover, the study by Heddam et al. (2022b) mentioned in the context used the Keras library in Python to build the LSTM model for predicting DO concentration in river water. Keras is a high-level neural networks API that can run on top of TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK. Therefore, it can be inferred that TensorFlow was used as the deep learning framework in this study.

However, it is important to note that the provided context does not explicitly confirm the use of TensorFlow or any other deep learning framework for building the LSTM model. Therefore, the answer to the query is:

Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework was used to build the LSTM model for predicting DO concentration in water. However, it can be inferred that TensorFlow was used in one of the studies mentioned in the context.
