Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context mainly discusses the number of links generated and received by source and target variables in a network, using mutual information (MI) and transfer entropy (TE) as measures. Additionally, it provides details about data collection and processing, but there is no mention of a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested information.
