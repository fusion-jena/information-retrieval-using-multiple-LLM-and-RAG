Answer:::

Based on the information provided, the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that artificial neural networks (ANNs), and more particularly multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), are used. MLPs are a type of feedforward neural network, which is different from convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and Transformers. CNNs are primarily used for image processing tasks, RNNs for sequential data, and Transformers for tasks involving understanding the context in a sequence of words. Since the pieces of context do not indicate any image processing, sequential data analysis, or natural language processing tasks, it is reasonable to assume that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is an MLP. However, this is an inference based on the given context, and the specific type of deep learning model could be different if more information was provided.
