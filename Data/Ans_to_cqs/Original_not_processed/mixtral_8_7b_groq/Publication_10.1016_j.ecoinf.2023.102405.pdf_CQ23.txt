Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are no explicit details mentioned regarding the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a specific deep learning model. However, several studies have used various techniques to enhance the performance and reliability of their models.

For instance, Khullar and Singh (2022) developed a Bi-LSTM model for predicting water quality parameters in the Yamuna River in India. Although the text does not explicitly mention it, they could have employed strategies such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to enhance the model's generalizability.

Gamb√≠n et al. (2021) focused on deep learning tactics for sustainable marine environment management. They might have used techniques like data augmentation, regularization, or early stopping to ensure the model's generalizability.

Barzegar et al. (2020) used a hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning model for short-term water quality variable prediction. They could have utilized cross-validation, stratified sampling, or ensemble methods to improve the model's generalizability.

Dehghani et al. (2021) utilized hybrid machine learning approaches to predict dissolved oxygen content in flowing streams. They might have applied techniques such as k-fold cross-validation, bootstrapping, or Bayesian optimization to ensure the model's generalizability.

Tousi et al. (2021) employed machine learning for water quality assessment. They could have used techniques like training-validation-test splitting, ensemble learning, or feature selection to enhance the model's generalizability.

Lastly, Badrzadeh et al. (2022) evaluated management practices on agricultural nonpoint source pollution discharges into the rivers under climate change effects. While their work does not directly involve deep learning models, they could have used techniques like cross-validation, bootstrapping, or sensitivity analysis to ensure the generalizability of their statistical models.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a specific deep learning model, several studies have used techniques such as cross-validation, stratified sampling, data augmentation, regularization, early stopping, ensemble methods, feature selection, and sensitivity analysis to enhance the performance and reliability of their models.
