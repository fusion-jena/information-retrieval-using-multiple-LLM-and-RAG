Answer:::

The provided context discusses a study that uses a deep learning model called AODEGRU for water contamination analysis in IoT-enabled aquaculture. However, it does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value.

However, generally, in deep learning pipelines, randomness can be handled using various strategies, such as setting a random seed value, data augmentation, and dropout regularization.

Setting a random seed value ensures reproducibility in the deep learning pipeline by controlling the randomness in weight initialization, data shuffling, and other random processes. By setting a fixed seed value, researchers can reproduce the same set of random numbers, ensuring consistent results across multiple runs.

Data augmentation is another strategy that introduces randomness in the input data to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset. Techniques such as rotation, scaling, flipping, and cropping can be used to generate new samples from the existing dataset, reducing overfitting and improving model generalization.

Dropout regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out a fraction of neurons during training. This introduces randomness in the network architecture, preventing the co-adaptation of neurons and promoting the learning of robust features.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, setting a random seed value, data augmentation, and dropout regularization are common strategies used in deep learning to handle randomness and improve model performance.
