Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the development and evaluation of a modified UNet convolutional neural network called Res_AUNet, which is used for water sun glint detection in UAV water images. However, it does not mention where the code for this pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query. It is possible that the code has not been made publicly available, or that it is hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. If you are interested in the code, I would recommend reaching out to the authors of the study for more information.
