Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning models in the provided context is plant species classification. This is evident in the description of the study's objective, which involves identifying plant species from image datasets. The models are used to classify images of plants into their respective species, and the performance of each model is evaluated based on metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score. These metrics are commonly used in classification tasks to measure the model's accuracy. Furthermore, the study compares the performance of different models to identify the best one for plant species classification. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning models in this context are used for plant species classification.
