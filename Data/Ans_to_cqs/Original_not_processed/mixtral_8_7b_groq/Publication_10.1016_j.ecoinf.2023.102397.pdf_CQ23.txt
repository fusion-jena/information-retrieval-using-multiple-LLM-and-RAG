Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model for species distribution. However, there are some implicit indications that the researchers may have taken steps to ensure the model's generalizability.

Firstly, the researchers used a large dataset for training the deep learning model. Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020) suggested that increasing the number of training recordings could improve the performance of the model. Therefore, using a large dataset could help the model to learn more diverse patterns and improve its ability to generalize to new data.

Secondly, the researchers measured the time each software spent on analyzing the entire target dataset. This suggests that they may have used the same dataset to test all the software programs, which would help to ensure that the comparison between them is fair and unbiased. Moreover, using the same dataset to test all the software programs would also help to ensure that the results are reproducible and generalizable.

Finally, the researchers analyzed the target set to detect possible differences among the software programs in evaluating the results. This analysis aimed to detect any biases in the detection patterns of the software programs. By detecting and controlling for these biases, the researchers could help to ensure that the results are not influenced by the specific characteristics of the software programs and are therefore more generalizable.

In summary, while there is no explicit information given about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, there are some implicit indications that the researchers may have taken steps to ensure the model's generalizability. These steps include using a large dataset for training the model, using the same dataset to test all the software programs, and analyzing the target set to detect and control for any biases in the detection patterns of the software programs. However, without further information, it is not possible to confirm whether these measures were taken or whether they were effective in ensuring the generalizability of the model.
