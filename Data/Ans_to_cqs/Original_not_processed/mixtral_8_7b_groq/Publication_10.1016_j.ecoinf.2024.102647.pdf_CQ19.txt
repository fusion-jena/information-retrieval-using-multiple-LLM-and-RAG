The provided context does not contain information about the use of deep learning models in the study. The models mentioned in the context are statistical models (frequency ratio and statistical index) and machine learning models (Random Forest and Classification and Regression Trees). These models were used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models in predicting groundwater (GW) salinity hazard maps for training and testing datasets.

The evaluation of the models was based on four criteria: coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), and correlation coefficient (COR). However, the context does not mention any deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the use of deep learning frameworks in building the models.

Answer:::
The provided context does not contain information about the use of deep learning models or deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
