Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are no specific preprocessing steps mentioned for the deep learning models used in the studies. However, it is generally common practice to perform certain preprocessing techniques before training deep learning models. These steps can include data normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

Data normalization is the process of adjusting the range of input features to ensure that all features contribute equally to the learning process. This can be done by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of each feature, a technique known as z-score normalization. Scaling is another form of normalization that resizes the range of features to a common scale, often between 0 and 1.

Cleaning the data involves handling missing or corrupted values, outliers, and duplicate entries. This step is crucial to ensure that the model learns from high-quality data and is not influenced by noise or incorrect information.

In the context of the studies provided, Sharma et al. (2017) used crowd-sourcing to obtain manual annotations for karyotyping images of chromosomes. While they do not explicitly mention any preprocessing steps, it is possible that some cleaning and normalization were performed on the annotations before using them for training.

Xu et al. (2021) developed a Convolutional Neural Network-based segmentation model for chromosome image analysis. They compared their model's performance against other methods, including the PCT method developed in Obara et al. (2012). However, there is no information on the preprocessing steps taken for the data used in their study.

Guo et al. (2021) extracted spherical patches around points of interest in 3D volumetric images and used a deep learning-based model to classify the point of interest. While the focus of their study is on the methodology for identifying cross-over points and overlaps, it is likely that some form of preprocessing, such as normalization or scaling, was performed on the image data before extracting the patches.

In summary, while there are no specific preprocessing steps mentioned in the provided context, it is common practice to perform data normalization, scaling, and cleaning before training deep learning models. These steps help ensure that the model learns from high-quality data and is not influenced by noise or incorrect information.
