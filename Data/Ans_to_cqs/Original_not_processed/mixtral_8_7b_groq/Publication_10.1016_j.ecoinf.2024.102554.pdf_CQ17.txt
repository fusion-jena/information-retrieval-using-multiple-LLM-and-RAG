The pieces of context provided do not directly discuss the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. However, they do provide information about the use of machine learning, particularly neural networks, in the context of estimating Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in aquatic environments.

In the context of estimating Chl-a concentrations, the IRTM-NN algorithm uses neural networks to address the problem as a non-linear multiple regression method. This method significantly reduces computational time once the network is properly trained to fit the coefficients. However, the text does not explicitly mention any regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting.

In general, deep learning models are prone to overfitting due to their complexity and the large number of parameters they learn during training. Regularization methods are essential to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of deep learning models. Some common regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines include L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, early stopping, and data augmentation.

L1 and L2 regularization add a penalty term to the loss function, which encourages the model to have smaller weights and prevents overfitting. Dropout is a technique that randomly sets a fraction of the neurons in a layer to zero during training, which helps to break the co-adaptation between neurons and improves the model's generalization ability. Early stopping is a method that stops the training process when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving, preventing the model from overfitting to the training data. Data augmentation is a technique that generates new training examples by applying random transformations to the existing data, which helps to increase the diversity of the training data and prevent overfitting.

In summary, while the provided pieces of context do not discuss the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, they do highlight the importance of machine learning, particularly neural networks, in estimating Chl-a concentrations. Regularization methods are crucial in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of the models. Some common regularization methods include L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, early stopping, and data augmentation.
