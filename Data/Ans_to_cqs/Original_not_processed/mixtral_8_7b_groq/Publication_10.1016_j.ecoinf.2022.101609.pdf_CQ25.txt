Answer:
The deep learning model is developed for regression problems, specifically for making day-ahead predictions of three pollutants - PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentrations. This is evident in the context where the model's performance is evaluated using regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The model is designed to learn from the structured data, which includes additional features to extend a typical time-series problem, allowing for the exploration of entity embeddings for categorical features. The primary purpose of this model is prediction, leveraging the power of deep learning to estimate air quality based on available data.
