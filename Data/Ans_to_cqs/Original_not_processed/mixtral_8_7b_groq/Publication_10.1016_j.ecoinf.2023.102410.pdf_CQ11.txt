Answer:::

The provided context does not include a direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that "The link to the data is shared in the manuscript." Therefore, I would recommend checking the manuscript associated with the Gavrilov et al. (2022) citation for the data repository link.

Additionally, the context includes a table (Table 1) that provides information on the number of tracked vocalisations of each song structure as a proportion of the whole dataset. This table shows the variants/patterns of the songs, the number of tracks, the percentage of tracking sample, and the percentage of detections.

The CRediT authorship contribution statement also provides information on the roles and contributions of the authors, including data curation by Curt Jenner and Micheline N. Jenner.

Therefore, while the direct link to the data repository is not provided in the context, there is information on the data and the authors' contributions to it.
