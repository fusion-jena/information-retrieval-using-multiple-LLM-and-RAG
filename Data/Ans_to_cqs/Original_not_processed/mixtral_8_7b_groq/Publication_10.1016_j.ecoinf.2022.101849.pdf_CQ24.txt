The provided context does not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the setting of a random seed value. However, it does discuss the use of machine learning methods, including neural networks, in the context of predicting potential natural vegetation (PNV) in ecology and biogeography.

In the study by Hengl et al. (2018), different machine learning methods were evaluated for PNV mapping in a classification setting. The authors used a random fraction of the data for training and testing the models, but they did not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value to ensure reproducibility.

The context also discusses the use of imputation techniques to handle missing data in PNV studies. In a study by Vaca et al. (2011), the authors used climatically based random forests to downscale coarse-grained PNV maps in tropical Mexico. They reduced the target variables by a random fraction, but they did not mention using a random seed value.

In a survey on semi-supervised learning by Van Engelen and Hoos (2020), the authors discussed the use of randomness in the context of model initialization and data splitting. They mentioned that setting a random seed value can help ensure reproducibility in model training and evaluation.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of randomness in the context of data splitting and model initialization. Additionally, studies in the field of PNV mapping have used random reduction techniques but have not explicitly mentioned the use of a random seed value. It is generally recommended to set a random seed value in deep learning pipelines to ensure reproducibility.
