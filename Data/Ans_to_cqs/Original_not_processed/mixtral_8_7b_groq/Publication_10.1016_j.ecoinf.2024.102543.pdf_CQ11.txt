Answer:::
I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the YOLOv8 algorithm, its variations, and a proposed modification called C2f2, as well as evaluation metrics such as mAP, Params, and FLOPs. However, there is no mention of a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
