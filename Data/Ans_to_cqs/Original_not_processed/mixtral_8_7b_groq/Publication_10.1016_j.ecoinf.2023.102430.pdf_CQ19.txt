The text provided does not give explicit information about the specific deep learning framework used to implement the convolutional neural network (CNN) model for classifying Chagas disease vectors. However, it does mention that the classical machine learning algorithms were run in Python using the scikit-learn toolbox.

Given that deep learning models are typically built using specialized libraries in Python such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, it is reasonable to infer that one of these two popular deep learning frameworks was used to build the CNN model in this study.

TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google Brain Team, which is widely used for building and training machine learning models, especially deep learning models. PyTorch, on the other hand, is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR), which is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it a popular choice among researchers and developers.

Without explicit information, it is difficult to determine which of these two deep learning frameworks was used in the study. Nonetheless, it is safe to say that either TensorFlow or PyTorch was used to build the deep learning model for classifying Chagas disease vectors.
