Answer:::
The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity (which is another term for recall), specificity, precision, and F1-score. 

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. It provides a general idea of the model's performance.

Sensitivity, also known as recall, is the ratio of true positive predictions (i.e., the number of correctly predicted positive cases) to the total number of actual positive cases. It measures the model's ability to correctly identify positive instances.

Specificity is the ratio of true negative predictions (i.e., the number of correctly predicted negative cases) to the total number of actual negative cases. It measures the model's ability to correctly identify negative instances.

Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions made by the model. It indicates the proportion of correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions.

The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and sensitivity, providing a balance between these two metrics. It is a more robust measure when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

In the provided context, these metrics are used to compare the performance of four different methods (Baseline, One-hot encoding, Embeddings, and Geographical prior) in a bird song classifier. The average evaluation measures over ten independent executions are reported for each method, with the best result for each metric highlighted in bold.
