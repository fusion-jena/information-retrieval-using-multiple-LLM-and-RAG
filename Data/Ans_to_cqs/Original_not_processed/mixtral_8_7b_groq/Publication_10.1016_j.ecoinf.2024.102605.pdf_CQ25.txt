Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning model used in the study by Zhang et al. (n.d.) is classification. Specifically, it is a machine learning algorithm, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), that was constructed to create a pest hazard class classification model. The model is used to identify the degree of damage to forest trees by the Elderberry Longhorn Beetle (EJD) in June, August, and September in the study area. The model classifies the level of pest damage based on sensitive spectral vegetation indices, and it achieved an overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient of 89.50% and 0.8666, respectively.

The study by Zhang et al. (n.d.) used the 1D-CNN algorithm to classify the degree of pest damage to forest trees. The algorithm was trained on spectral vegetation indices, which are measurements of vegetation health and density obtained from remote sensing data. The algorithm classifies the level of pest damage into different classes, such as no damage, low damage, medium damage, and high damage.

The study found that the 1D-CNN algorithm performed well in classifying the degree of pest damage to forest trees. The algorithm's classification results were consistent with the actual affected forest trees' distribution. This indicates that the deep learning model is effective in classifying the level of pest damage to forest trees based on spectral vegetation indices.

In summary, the purpose of the deep learning model used in the study by Zhang et al. (n.d.) is classification, specifically, to classify the degree of pest damage to forest trees based on spectral vegetation indices. The model achieved high accuracy in classifying the level of pest damage, indicating its effectiveness in this task.
