Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of satellite image data for land use and land cover (LULC) classification using machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, it does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a specific answer regarding the data formats (e.g., image, audio, video, CSV) used in the deep learning pipeline.

Nonetheless, considering the nature of the task at hand, it can be inferred that the primary data format used is likely to be multi-spectral or multi-band raster image data, as LULC classification typically involves analyzing satellite or aerial imagery. These images consist of multiple bands, each representing a different portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, which can be used as input features for ML models.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that raster image data is the primary format based on the nature of LULC classification tasks.
