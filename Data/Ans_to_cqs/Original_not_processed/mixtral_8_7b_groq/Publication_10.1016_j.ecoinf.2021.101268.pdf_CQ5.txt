Answer:::

In the deep learning pipeline, the datasets used are not limited to MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. While these datasets are widely used in deep learning research, the specific dataset used in the given context is the Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset. This dataset is introduced in the paper for the purpose of classifying ten species of leaves in the Peruvian Amazon forest. The dataset comprises 59,441 samples collected from ten of the most profitable and endangered species. To ensure variability and develop a flexible solution for real-world conditions, six different commercial cameras were used for data collection.

In addition, the deep learning pipeline in this context employs pre-trained models from the ImageNet dataset for transfer learning. Transfer learning is a technique where pre-trained models capture low-level features from one domain and transfer them to another domain with similar characteristics. In this case, the pre-trained models capture low-level features from the ImageNet dataset and fine-tune them to learn specific higher-level features of leaf arrangements and venations in the Peruvian Amazon forest.

The four pre-trained models used for comparison are AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201. These models are chosen for their architectural characteristics and performance on image classification tasks. The fully connected block of these models is adjusted to feed off the feature vector and output the ten species of leaves.

Therefore, in summary, the deep learning pipeline in this context uses the Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset for leaf species classification and pre-trained models from the ImageNet dataset for transfer learning.
