Answer:::
The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the description of the model architecture, which includes four convolutional layers and a fully connected layer with 100 hidden units. The convolutional layers use 3D filters, with the first layer having 3 × 3 × N filters, the second and third layers having 3 × 3 × 20 filters, and the fourth layer having 1 × 1 × 100 filters. The fully connected layer follows these convolutional layers. The CNN model is used for image segmentation tasks, as it is designed to learn spatial hierarchies of features from images, which is essential for accurate segmentation.

Furthermore, the use of DeepLabV3+, a state-of-the-art CNN-based model for semantic image segmentation, supports the conclusion that a CNN model is used. DeepLabV3+ is a widely recognized CNN architecture that has been successful in various image segmentation tasks. The training parameters provided in the table are specific to DeepLabV3+, further confirming the use of a CNN model.

However, it is important to note that the input to the CNN model can be either RGB images (with N=3) or RGB images with an additional NIR band (with N=4). This flexibility in input channels does not change the fact that the underlying model is a CNN.

In summary, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the DeepLabV3+ architecture, designed for image segmentation tasks.
