Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, it does provide some insights into the methodology used for developing the model.

The authors used Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellite data to create six different batches of samples, each with varying combinations of visible bands, multispectral bands, spectral indices, spectral features, textural features, and Digital Surface Model (DSM) data. They used a point-wise sample selection strategy and a robust system architecture for feature selection and optimizing Support Vector Machine (SVM) parameters.

It can be inferred that the trained model was developed using this SVM classifier, and the authors used a 60%-40% ratio for training and validation samples. After selecting the samples, they checked them carefully and found no mis-collected samples.

However, the context does not provide information on how the trained model was serialized or deployed on a specific platform. Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model's architecture and weights so that it can be loaded and used for making predictions on new data. Platform selection refers to choosing the hardware or software environment where the model will be deployed for production use.

Therefore, while the context provides valuable insights into the development of the trained model, it does not answer the query about the process followed to deploy the model.
