Answer:::

The provided context discusses the process of training a deep learning (DL) model for practical ecological applications, including the use of a multi-scale U-net network. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the DL model.

In general, DL models require significant computational power for training, which is often provided by specialized hardware such as graphics processing units (GPUs) or tensor processing units (TPUs). These hardware components can perform parallel computations, allowing them to handle the large number of parameters and data required for DL training more efficiently than traditional central processing units (CPUs).

Therefore, while the provided context does not specify the exact hardware resources used for training the DL model, it is likely that GPUs or TPUs were employed to provide the necessary computational power for the training process.
