Answer:::

The provided context does not directly discuss the strategies employed to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. The text focuses on the use of a workflow to associate information on stocks, species variety, and threatening status to the fishing hours of each cell in a studied area, using big data processing methods and a FAIR approach.

However, it is worth noting that some machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models, incorporate randomness in their training process. For instance, techniques such as dropout, random weight initialization, and shuffling of training data are commonly used to introduce stochasticity and improve model generalization.

Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of input neurons to zero during training, preventing overfitting. Random weight initialization is the practice of assigning random values to the weights of the neural network at the start of training, which helps break symmetry and ensures that different neurons learn different features. Shuffling of training data involves randomly reordering the training samples before each epoch, reducing the likelihood of co-adaptation of features.

The use of a random seed value is a common practice in machine learning to ensure reproducibility of results. By setting a fixed seed value, the random number generator used in the algorithm produces the same sequence of random numbers, leading to consistent outcomes across multiple runs. Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is plausible that the deep learning models used in this workflow incorporate similar strategies to handle randomness.
