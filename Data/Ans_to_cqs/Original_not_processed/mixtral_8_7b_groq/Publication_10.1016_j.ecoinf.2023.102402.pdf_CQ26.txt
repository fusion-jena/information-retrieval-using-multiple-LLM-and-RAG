Answer:::

The provided context discusses various methods and techniques used in species distribution modeling, including data preprocessing and model selection. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I will provide a general overview of some common techniques used to address data bias in machine learning, which can also be applied during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.

1. Stratified splitting: Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures each subset (e.g., training, validation, or testing) has approximately the same percentage of samples for each class as the complete dataset. This technique can help ensure that the model is exposed to a diverse range of samples during training, reducing bias.

2. Oversampling: Oversampling is a technique used to increase the number of instances from the minority class to balance the dataset. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class. However, oversampling can lead to overfitting if not done carefully.

3. Undersampling: Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the number of instances from the majority class to balance the dataset. This can help reduce bias towards the majority class, but it may result in loss of valuable information.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting diverse data is crucial for reducing bias in machine learning models. This includes collecting data from various sources, geographical locations, and time periods. Diverse data can help ensure that the model is exposed to a wide range of variations in the input space, reducing the likelihood of bias.

5. Synthetic data generation: Synthetic data generation techniques, such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), can be used to create new instances for the minority class. This can help balance the dataset without oversampling real instances, reducing the risk of overfitting.

6. Reweighting: Reweighting is a technique used to adjust the contribution of each sample to the loss function during training. This can help reduce bias towards the majority class by assigning higher weights to minority class samples.

7. Ensemble methods: Ensemble methods, such as bagging and boosting, can help reduce bias by combining the predictions of multiple models trained on different subsets of the data. This can help ensure that the final model is exposed to a diverse range of samples and variations in the input space.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, several common techniques can be applied, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection, synthetic data generation, reweighting, and ensemble methods. Careful consideration of these techniques can help ensure that the deep learning model is not biased towards any particular class or subset of the data.
