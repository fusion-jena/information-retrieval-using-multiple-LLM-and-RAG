Answer:::

 The provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the methodology and application of remote sensing for species distribution in the Brazilian Amazon forest, but it does not give any details about the code repository or its location, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
