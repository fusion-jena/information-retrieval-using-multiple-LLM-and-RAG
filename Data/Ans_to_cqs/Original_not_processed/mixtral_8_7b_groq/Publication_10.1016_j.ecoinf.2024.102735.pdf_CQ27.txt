Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, we can infer some steps that might have been taken based on common practices in machine learning model development.

Answer:::

After training and optimizing the RF and SVR models using 80% of the datasets, the next step would typically be to evaluate the model performance using the remaining 20% of the data, which was set aside for testing. This would involve making predictions on the test dataset and comparing them to the actual values to calculate metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE) or R-squared.

Once the model performance has been evaluated and found to be satisfactory, the next step would be to prepare the model for deployment. This could involve several steps, such as:

1. Model serialization: This involves saving the trained model to a file so that it can be loaded and used for making predictions on new data. In Python, this can be done using the `joblib` or `pickle` libraries.
2. Platform selection: The choice of platform for deploying the model would depend on the specific use case and requirements. For example, if the model is to be used in a web application, it might be deployed on a server using a framework such as Flask or Django. Alternatively, if the model is to be used for batch processing of large datasets, it might be deployed on a cluster using a distributed computing framework such as Apache Spark.
3. Model validation: Before deploying the model, it is important to validate it thoroughly to ensure that it is robust and generalizable. This could involve testing the model on a separate validation dataset that was not used during training or optimization.
4. Model monitoring: Once the model is deployed, it is important to monitor its performance over time to ensure that it continues to perform well as new data becomes available. This could involve tracking metrics such as prediction accuracy or model confidence, and setting up alerts to notify developers if the model performance drops below a certain threshold.

Overall, while the specific steps taken to deploy the trained deep learning model are not provided in the context, we can infer that they might include model serialization, platform selection, model validation, and model monitoring.
