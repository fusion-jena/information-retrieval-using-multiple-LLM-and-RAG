Answer: The strategy to monitor the model performance during training involves evaluating the F1-score, which is a measure of the balance between precision and recall. The F1-score is used to assess the performance of the WT-HMM (Wavelet Transform Hidden Markov Model) classifier when trained with varying dataset sizes. 

The F1-score close to 1 indicates a better model performance, suggesting that the classifier is accurately identifying positive instances with minimal false positives or false negatives. Conversely, a low F1-score (close to 0) implies that the model might be struggling to classify positive instances correctly or might be missing a significant number of positive instances.

In addition, the experiments are repeated over different runs to account for the variability introduced by the random factors in the classification algorithm, such as random initialization of weights in Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) or random sampling during training. This approach helps capture the impact of these random factors on the model's performance, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the WT-HMM's behavior during training.

Moreover, the comparison of the WT-HMM's performance across different recording months and dataset sizes reveals that the most suitable dataset size range for achieving high accuracy is within the 8 to 20-hour dataset size range. This finding supports the importance of selecting appropriate sample sizes for effective model training, as emphasized in previous studies (Kahl et al., 2021). Overall, the monitoring strategy focuses on the F1-score and variations in performance due to random factors, aiming to ensure a well-balanced and accurate classifier during the WT-HMM training process.
