Based on the provided context, the text does not mention the use of a deep learning model. The model that is discussed and evaluated in the text is a random forest model, which is a type of ensemble learning method. Deep learning models are a subset of machine learning models that are typically characterized by the use of neural networks with multiple layers. These models are often used for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

In this study, the authors use a random forest model for predicting crop yields using remote sensing and meteorological data. The purpose of the model is to provide accurate and reliable predictions of crop yields by selecting the most relevant input features and averaging the results from many decision trees. The authors also mention that they used Bayesian optimization to hyperparameter tuning to minimize the cross-validation loss during model development.

In summary, the text does not provide information on the purpose of a deep learning model, as the model used in the study is a random forest model. Random forest models are used for making predictions by averaging the results from many decision trees, and are often used for regression and classification tasks. Deep learning models, on the other hand, are a subset of machine learning models that use neural networks with multiple layers and are often used for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.
