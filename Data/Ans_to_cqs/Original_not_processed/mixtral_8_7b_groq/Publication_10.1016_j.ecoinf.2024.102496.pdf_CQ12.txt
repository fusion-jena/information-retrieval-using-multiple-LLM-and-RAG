Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific deep learning model used in the pipeline. The text describes the development of an equitable nutrient reduction decision support tool, which includes various features such as a user interface with filtering metrics, search bars, and different basemaps. It also mentions the use of geospatial data for pollutant loads and environmental justice metrics. However, it does not provide information about the implementation of any deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
