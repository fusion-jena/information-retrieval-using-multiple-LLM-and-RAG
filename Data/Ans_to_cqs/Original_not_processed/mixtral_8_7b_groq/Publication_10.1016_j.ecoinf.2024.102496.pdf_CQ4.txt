I'm sorry for any confusion, but the context provided does not include information about data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. These techniques are commonly used in machine learning to increase the amount and diversity of training data, but the provided texts focus on environmental science topics like Best Management Practices (BMPs), green infrastructure, water rights, and nutrient levels in Florida waters.

The first link, "Introduction to a Natural Treasure," is an environmental overview of the Anacostia River and its watershed, while the second link, "Overcoming Barriers to Green Infrastructure," discusses the challenges and solutions for implementing green infrastructure in urban areas. The third link, "Watershed Boundary Dataset," provides information about a geographic dataset used for hydrological studies. The remaining links are academic papers examining environmental issues in Florida, such as environmental injustice and flood risk.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
