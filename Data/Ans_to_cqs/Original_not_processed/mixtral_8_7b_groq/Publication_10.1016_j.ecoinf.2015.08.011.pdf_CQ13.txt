Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, specifically an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), include the learning rate, the number of nodes in the hidden layer, and the maximum number of training epochs.

The learning rate determines the size of the steps that the model takes while navigating the error surface during training. In this study, the learning rate was varied from 0.01 to 1.0 in increments of 0.05. The optimal learning rate was found to be 0.7, as it resulted in the maximum model performance as indicated by the Mean Square Error (MSE) between the model output and the measured data.

The number of nodes in the hidden layer, also known as neurons, determines the capacity of the model to reflect nonlinearity within the training data. In this study, the number of nodes in the hidden layer was varied between 5 and 23. The optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer was found to be 19, as it resulted in the maximum model performance as indicated by the MSE.

The maximum number of training epochs determines the number of times the model will cycle through the entire training dataset. However, the context does not provide information on the maximum number of training epochs used in this study.

Additionally, the study applied a trial-and-error method to determine the appropriate number of neurons and learning rate. An early stopping technique was also employed to hinder overfitting, where the data set was randomly split into two sets, 80% for model training and 20% for model testing. The model weights were randomly initialized, and the training process was stopped when the network began to overfit the data, i.e., the error on the validation set.

It is also worth noting that the ANN structure had 5 input variables with one node accounting for bias and one output variable of the output layer.

In summary, the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model in this study include the learning rate, the number of nodes in the hidden layer, and the maximum number of training epochs (although the maximum number of training epochs is not specified). An early stopping technique and a trial-and-error method were also used to determine the appropriate number of neurons and learning rate.
