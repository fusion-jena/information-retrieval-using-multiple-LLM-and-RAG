The text provided does not give information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the pipeline involves training a model using a large amount of training data that includes a Near-Infrared (NIR) band in addition to RGB bands. This suggests that the dataset used likely includes multi-spectral or hyperspectral images with at least four bands.

Additionally, the authors mention the use of pre-trained models, which are typically trained on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet. Therefore, it is possible that the authors used ImageNet or a similar dataset to train the initial layers of their model using transfer learning.

Finally, the authors mention the need for significant GPU power to train the model with batch sizes larger than 16. This suggests that the dataset used is large enough to require high-performance computing resources for efficient training.

In summary, while the specific datasets used are not mentioned in the text, it is likely that the pipeline involves training a model on a large-scale dataset that includes multi-spectral or hyperspectral images with at least four bands. Additionally, the authors may have used a pre-trained model trained on a large-scale dataset such as ImageNet to initialize the weights of their model.
