The provided context does not contain information about specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does discuss an experiment related to the use of machine learning (ML) models, specifically bounding box models, in the process of data labeling for wildlife monitoring using camera traps.

In the context of this experiment, the ML model's performance, including its false positive and false negative predictions, was found to impact the efficiency of the data labeling process. While the ML bounding boxes offered significant improvement in tagging efficiency compared to unassisted tagging, incorrect ML predictions could slow down the tagging process.

In general, the use of a random seed value in deep learning is a strategy to ensure reproducibility of results by fixing the random number generator's starting point. This can be important for debugging, comparing different models, and reporting results. However, the specific use of a random seed value in the context of the provided experiment is not mentioned.

Therefore, while the text discusses the impact of ML model performance on data labeling efficiency, it does not provide information on strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
