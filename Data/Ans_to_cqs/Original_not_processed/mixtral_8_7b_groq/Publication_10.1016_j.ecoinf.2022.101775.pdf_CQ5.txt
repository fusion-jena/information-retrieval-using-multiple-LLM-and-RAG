Answer:::
The provided context does not specify the exact datasets used in the described deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the deep learning models were trained and tested in Google Colaboratory. Commonly used datasets in deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet, are often used in tutorials and examples for deep learning libraries, and they could have been used in this case.

The context also discusses the use of deep learning for processing data from Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and recovering a significant amount of information that was not sampled by modeling non-linear interactions of input data. Specifically, it mentions a paper by Xue et al. (2017) that proposes a matrix completion solution for recovering corrupted data in sensor networks. Therefore, it is possible that a dataset of sensor network data was used in this deep learning pipeline.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of the scikit-learn library for machine learning in Python, but it does not specify whether this library was used for dataset preprocessing or for implementing the deep learning models.

In summary, while the exact datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not specified in the provided context, it is possible that commonly used datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet were used, or that a dataset of sensor network data was used. The scikit-learn library was also mentioned, but its specific role in the pipeline is not clear.
