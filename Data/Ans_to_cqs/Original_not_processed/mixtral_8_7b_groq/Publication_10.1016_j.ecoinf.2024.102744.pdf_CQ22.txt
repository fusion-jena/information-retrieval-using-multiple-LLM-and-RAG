Answer: The performance of the deep learning model for pollen-bearing bee detection is evaluated using several metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-score, False Alarm Rate (FAR), and Miss Rate (MR). 

Precision measures the proportion of true positive detections out of all positive detections made by the model. Recall, on the other hand, measures the proportion of true positive detections out of all actual pollen-bearing bees present in the image. The F1 score is used to gauge the balance between Precision and Recall, and it is determined as the harmonic mean of these two metrics.

In addition to these metrics, the VnPollenBee dataset also uses FAR and MR to evaluate the model's performance. FAR measures the proportion of false positive detections, while MR measures the proportion of missed pollen-bearing bees. These metrics are computed using the formulas TP, TN, FP, and FN, which stand for True Positive, True Negative, False Positive, and False Negative, respectively.

The provided table compares the performance of various models, including the proposed methods, baseline methods, and other state-of-the-art methods, using these evaluation metrics. The best metric values are shown in bold font, while the second-highest values are underlined.

It can be observed that the proposed methods have higher Precision, Recall, and F1 score than the baseline methods and other state-of-the-art methods. However, the MR of the proposed methods is slightly higher than that of DETR, but the difference is not significant.

Therefore, the deep learning model's performance for pollen-bearing bee detection is evaluated using multiple metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1 score, FAR, and MR. The proposed methods have shown superior performance in detecting pollen-bearing bees, as indicated by their higher Precision, Recall, and F1 score.
