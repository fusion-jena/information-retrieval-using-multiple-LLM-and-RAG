The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the random seed value. However, it does discuss two methods for addressing limited data in deep learning for fish species classification: data augmentation and few-shot learning (FSL) algorithms.

Data augmentation techniques, such as flipping, rotating, and zooming, can increase the size of the training dataset and reduce overfitting (Van Dyk and Meng, 2012; Wang and Perez, 2017; Wong et al., 2016). These techniques can also introduce randomness in the training process, as the augmented data can vary with each iteration. However, the context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline beyond data augmentation.

FSL algorithms, on the other hand, are designed to compute a classification task with only a few thumbnails to train (Fei-fei et al., 2006; Fink, 2005). These algorithms can be divided into three main approaches: metric-based methods, model-based methods, and optimization-based methods (Finn et al., 2017; Sung et al., 2018; Victor and Bruna, 2018; Yanbin et al., 2019). While these methods can help reduce the dependence on large datasets, they do not directly address the issue of randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot provide a specific answer to the query regarding strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the random seed value. However, it is worth noting that deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch provide options for setting a random seed value to ensure reproducibility in the training process.
