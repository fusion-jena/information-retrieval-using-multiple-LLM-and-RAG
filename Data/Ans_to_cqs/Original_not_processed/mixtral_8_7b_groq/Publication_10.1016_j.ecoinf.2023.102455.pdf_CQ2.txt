Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses a deep learning model for forecasting daily streamflow (Qflow), which involves feeding predictors to the model after decomposing them into components. The predictors could be time-series data representing hydrological variables such as precipitation, temperature, and humidity, which are typically stored in CSV format. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that CSV format is used in this deep learning pipeline.

The context also describes the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which is a popular deep learning model for image recognition tasks. In CNN, the input layer receives image data, which is typically represented as a multi-dimensional array. Therefore, it is also possible that image data is used in this deep learning pipeline.

Furthermore, the context describes the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) model, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model used for sequential data analysis tasks such as time-series forecasting and natural language processing. In Bi-GRU, the input data is a sequence of vectors, which could be derived from various data formats such as text, audio, or video.

In summary, based on the provided context, it is likely that the deep learning pipeline uses CSV format for time-series data and possibly image data. Additionally, it may use other data formats such as text, audio, or video for sequential data analysis tasks using RNN models such as Bi-GRU.
