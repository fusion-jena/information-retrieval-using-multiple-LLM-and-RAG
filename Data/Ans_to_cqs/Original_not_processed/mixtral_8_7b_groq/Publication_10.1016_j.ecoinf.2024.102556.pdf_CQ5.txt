Answer:::
The context provided does not include information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It focuses on describing the architecture and components of a multiscale feature-extraction network (MSNet) and its application in the Deep SORT algorithm for object tracking. The datasets used for training and testing this pipeline could be any of the standard image or video datasets commonly used in deep learning research, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, but the text does not specify. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given context.
