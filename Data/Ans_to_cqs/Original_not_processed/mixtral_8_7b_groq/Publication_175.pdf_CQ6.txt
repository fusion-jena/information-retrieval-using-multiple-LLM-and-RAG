Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are no specific preprocessing steps mentioned for the training of a deep learning model. However, data augmentation is used in the training process. Data augmentation is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the diversity of data available for training models, without actually collecting new data. This is achieved by applying various transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, shifting, flipping, and zooming. Data augmentation is used to improve the model's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data, thereby improving its performance.

In addition, the context mentions that different datasets were used for training, including the biggest dataset AT0, a more limited dataset AT1, and subsampled datasets with 250 and 500 images per class. This suggests that the preprocessing steps may include subsampling, which is a technique used to reduce the size of a dataset by randomly selecting a subset of the data.

Furthermore, the use of ResNet100 as the deep learning algorithm implies that some preprocessing steps may be specific to this architecture. For instance, ResNet100 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that takes images as input. Therefore, the images in the dataset must be preprocessed to a standard size and format that can be fed into the CNN. This may include steps such as image resizing, normalization, and scaling.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, it can be inferred that data augmentation, subsampling, and preprocessing the images to a standard size and format are likely to be included.
