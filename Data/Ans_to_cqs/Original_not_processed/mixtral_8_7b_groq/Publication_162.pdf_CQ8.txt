Answer:

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used for fauna and flora monitoring. The text focuses on the research and evaluation of a specific architecture called D-Mask R-CNN for animal detection, particularly for deer instances, using RGB-D data. It discusses the data preprocessing, network architecture, and evaluation metrics but does not mention the code repository or its location. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
