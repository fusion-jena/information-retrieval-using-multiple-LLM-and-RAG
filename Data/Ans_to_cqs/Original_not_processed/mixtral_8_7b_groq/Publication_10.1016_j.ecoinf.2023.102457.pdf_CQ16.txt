Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the study. However, it is mentioned that supervised classification was used, which typically involves training a model on a labeled dataset and then evaluating its performance on a separate validation set. The training process usually continues until the model's performance on the validation set stops improving or reaches a satisfactory level.

In the context provided, the study focuses on comparing different feature extraction methods for great tit calls, including Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), embeddings from pre-trained convolutional neural networks (BirdNET, VGGish, Wav2Vec 2.0), and acoustic indices. The performance of these feature extraction methods is evaluated based on classification accuracy and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) for clustering.

The study reports the highest accuracy for MFCCs, especially at farther distances, and successful clustering using MFCCs and HDBSCAN for unsupervised classification at distances up to 150 meters. However, the training process and the criteria used to determine training completion are not discussed.

(Note: The provided context does not contain information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.)
