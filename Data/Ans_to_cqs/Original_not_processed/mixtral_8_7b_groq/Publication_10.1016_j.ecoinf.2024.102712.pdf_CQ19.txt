Based on the provided context, there is no specific mention of the deep learning frameworks used to build the model. The context discusses the potential of modeling frameworks combined with data from sources such as Sentinel-2 to support intergovernmental policy initiatives. It also mentions examples of model-assisted frameworks and hierarchical modeling. However, it does not specify any deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query without additional information.
