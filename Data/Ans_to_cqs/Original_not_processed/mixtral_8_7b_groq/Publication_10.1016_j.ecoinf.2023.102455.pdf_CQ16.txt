Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the training process for each model (MVMD-KELM, MVMD-CNN-BiRNN, CNN-BiGRU, RVFL, KELM, and CNN-BiRNN) involves a phase of training followed by a phase of testing, which suggests that the training process might be complete when a certain level of performance is achieved during the testing phase.

The performance of each model is evaluated using several statistical criteria, including the coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The coefficient (R) measures the correlation between the observed and forecasted values, with a value closer to 1 indicating a stronger correlation. The RMSE measures the difference between the observed and forecasted values, with a lower value indicating a better fit. The MAPE measures the absolute difference between the observed and forecasted values as a percentage of the observed values, with a lower value indicating a better fit.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the training process for each model might be complete when the model achieves a satisfactory level of performance based on these statistical criteria during the testing phase. However, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not provided in the context.
