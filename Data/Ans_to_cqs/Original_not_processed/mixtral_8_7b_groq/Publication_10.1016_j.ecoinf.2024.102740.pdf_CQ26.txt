The provided context does not directly discuss data bias techniques in the context of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques, including Random Forest (RF), for analyzing grassland data. In ML and deep learning, data bias can be addressed during preprocessing using techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling is a method of splitting data into subsets that maintains the original dataset's distribution of classes. This technique can help ensure that each subset has a fair representation of all classes, reducing bias.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance classes in an imbalanced dataset. Oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of samples from the majority class. Balancing the dataset can help the model learn from both the minority and majority classes more effectively, reducing bias.

Diverse data collection involves gathering data from various sources, ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population. This technique can help reduce bias by ensuring that the dataset includes a wide range of variations and patterns.

In the context of the provided articles, the authors used RF for ML training, with 34 ground data points. They used the "out-of-bag" (OOB) samples for validation, which are those not included in the training subset. This technique helps to provide an unbiased estimate of the generalization error.

Moreover, the authors used SAGA software (version 9.4.0) to perform classification using the RF technique based on Red Green Blue (RGB) images acquired in March, April, and May. They tested the maximum shaft number value from 1 to 100 and the minimum sample number from 1 to 50. Finally, they obtained the most accurate results for RF when the maximum tree depth was set to 10 and the minimum number of samples was set to 2.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss data bias techniques in the context of a deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of ML techniques, including RF, for analyzing grassland data. Techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be used to address data bias during preprocessing in ML and deep learning pipelines.
