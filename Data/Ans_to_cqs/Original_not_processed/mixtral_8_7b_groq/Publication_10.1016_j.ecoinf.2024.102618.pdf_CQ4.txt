Answer: The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as described in the context, include flipping, rotation, as well as other methods such as cropping, shifting, Principal Components Analysis (PCA), color, noise, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). 

In the research conducted by Shijie et al. (2017), several data augmentation methods were used to enhance the diversity of the data for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model. Specifically, they utilized flipping, cropping, shifting, PCA, color, noise, and rotation techniques. Their experiments proved that the performance of four augmentation techniques, including cropping, flipping, GANs, and rotation, was better than the other methods. 

Moreover, the research by Shrivastava and Pradhan (2021) on rice plant disease classification using color features also employed data augmentation techniques such as flipping and rotation. 

These studies highlight the significance of using a combination of various augmentation methods, which is more advantageous than using individual methods alone. Therefore, the data augmentation techniques of flipping and rotation are indeed applied in the deep learning pipeline for image classification tasks.
