The provided context does not contain specific information about data bias techniques used during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention various hyperparameters of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other models used for image classification tasks, such as pine tree classification and plant leaf/disease classification.

In general, to address data bias during preprocessing, several techniques can be employed:

1. **Stratified splitting**: When splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, this method ensures that the distribution of classes remains similar across all sets. This is particularly important when classes are imbalanced.

2. **Oversampling**: This technique involves increasing the number of instances from the minority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by randomly duplicating instances or using more advanced techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), which creates synthetic instances based on the feature space similarities between existing instances.

3. **Undersampling**: This method reduces the number of instances from the majority class to balance the dataset. This can be done randomly or by using more sophisticated techniques that maintain the class distribution while preserving the structure of the original dataset.

4. **Diverse data collection**: Collecting a diverse dataset with adequate representation from all classes is crucial for reducing data bias. This can involve gathering data from various sources, ensuring that the dataset includes different demographics, geographical locations, and other relevant factors.

While the provided context does not discuss these techniques directly, it is essential to consider data bias and preprocessing techniques when working with deep learning pipelines. These methods can help improve model performance and ensure fairness in the classification process.
