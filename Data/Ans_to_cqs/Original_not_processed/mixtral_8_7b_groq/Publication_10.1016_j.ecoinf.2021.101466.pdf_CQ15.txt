Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline in the given context uses the Adagrad optimization technique. The EfficientNet model was trained by Adagrad in 100 epochs. Adagrad is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate to the parameters, specifically for gradient-based optimization. It is a per-parameter adaptation approach, unlike other methods such as SGD or Adam, which maintain a single learning rate for all parameters. Adagrad has been found to be effective in various deep learning applications, as it adjusts the learning rate based on the historical gradient information of each parameter. This can lead to faster and more efficient training, especially for problems with sparse gradients.
