Answer:::

In the context of deep learning, there are several strategies employed to handle randomness in the pipeline. One common method is the use of a random seed value. A random seed is a number used to initialize the random number generator, which in turn generates other random numbers. By setting a specific seed value, the sequence of random numbers generated can be replicated, ensuring consistent and reproducible results across different runs of the model.

The Navares and Aznarte (2020) paper on predicting air quality with deep learning LSTM models does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value. However, it is likely that they used a fixed seed value in their experiments to ensure the reproducibility of their results.

The Neckel et al. (2023) paper on air pollution in Budapest also does not explicitly discuss the use of a random seed value. However, they used a deep learning model called U-Net, which has a random initialization step. To ensure reproducibility, they probably set a fixed seed value before running the model.

The Ogen (2020) paper on assessing nitrogen dioxide levels as a contributing factor to COVID-19 fatality does not involve deep learning or random seed values directly. However, the author used publicly available data, which may have been generated with a fixed seed value for reproducibility.

The Pandey (2020) paper on fly ash deposits as a potential sink for carbon sequestration does not involve deep learning or random seed values.

In the provided data statistics, there is no direct reference to the use of a random seed value. However, it is common practice to use a fixed seed value when performing experiments involving deep learning models.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value in every case, it is a common practice in deep learning to handle randomness and ensure reproducibility. Researchers usually set a fixed seed value before running their models to ensure consistent results.
