Answer:::

The deep learning models used in the pipeline mentioned are Transformer-like and CNN-like models. 

The Transformer-like model is a type of architecture initially designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks in natural language processing (NLP). It was proposed by Vaswani et al. (2017) and has since been applied in computer vision (CV) tasks. The core structure of this model consists of an encoder module, which has several stacked blocks. Each block contains two components: a token mixer module for fusing spatial information and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) module for fusing channel information. Different transformer-like visual models have variations in the token mixer module. For instance, the token mixer in a Vision Transformer (ViT) is a self-attention module (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020).

On the other hand, the CNN-like model used in the pipeline is ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016), a well-known convolutional neural network (CNN) model. CNNs are classical models in CV, known for their robust translational invariance and ability to extract high-level semantic features. ResNet-50 comprises four stages, each containing multiple blocks with three convolutional layers. Additionally, there is an independent convolutional layer at the start of the network and a fully connected layer at the end for classification, resulting in 50 layers.

In summary, the pipeline utilizes both Transformer-like and CNN-like models, specifically ViT and ResNet-50, to process and analyze the data.
