Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, including steps such as model serialization or platform selection. The context mainly focuses on the use of deep learning and machine learning algorithms for enhancing groundwater-climate interactions understanding within the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) region. It also mentions the use of GRACE-TWS data and GLDAS Noah soil moisture data with different spatial resolutions, and a linear regression model for data processing.

However, generally, when deploying a trained deep learning model, data scientists and researchers often follow these steps:

1. Model serialization: After training the deep learning model, the model's architecture, weights, and biases are saved into a file, allowing the model to be reloaded and used for making predictions on new data. Common formats for model serialization include HDF5, JSON, XML, and protocol buffers.

2. Platform selection: The trained model is then deployed on a suitable platform for serving predictions. This platform can be a local machine, a virtual machine, or a cloud-based platform such as Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), or Microsoft Azure. The choice of platform depends on factors such as the required computational resources, scalability, and cost.

3. Integration with an application or service: The deployed model is often integrated with an application or service that exposes the model's functionality to end-users. This can be a web application, a mobile application, or a backend service that accepts requests and returns predictions.

4. Monitoring and maintenance: After deployment, the model's performance is monitored, and updates or adjustments are made as needed. This may involve retraining the model on new data, tweaking the model's architecture, or addressing any issues that arise during deployment.

Without more specific information from the context, it's impossible to say with certainty which of these steps were taken in this case. However, these steps provide a general outline of the process typically followed when deploying a trained deep learning model.
