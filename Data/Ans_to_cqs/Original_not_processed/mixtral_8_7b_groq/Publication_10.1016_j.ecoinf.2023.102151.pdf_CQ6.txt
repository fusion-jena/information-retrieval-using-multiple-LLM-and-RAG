Answer:

Based on the provided sources, I can infer that there are several preprocessing steps that can be involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning. However, the specific preprocessing steps required can depend on the nature of the data and the specific requirements of the deep learning model.

For instance, in the context of digital soil mapping, a study by Hu et al. (2
