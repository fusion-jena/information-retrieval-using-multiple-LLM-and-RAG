Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipelines for insect image processing and identification. However, it is mentioned that several studies have harnessed the power of deep-learning (DL) based image processing to alleviate the burden on applied entomologists who monitor specific forestry, agricultural, and medical pests. These studies typically follow a four-step process, which includes building a statistical model of the classes (training) using insect images that have been collected and labeled by experts.

Regularization methods, such as dropout and L2 regularization, are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the input units to zero during training, which helps to prevent co-adaptation of feature detectors. L2 regularization, on the other hand, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which can help to reduce overfitting.

While the specific regularization methods used in the studies mentioned in the context are not specified, it is likely that some form of regularization was used during the training phase to prevent overfitting. This is because regularization is a standard technique in deep learning, and it is commonly used to improve the generalization performance of deep learning models.

In summary, while the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipelines for insect image processing and identification are not mentioned in the provided context, it is likely that some form of regularization was used during the training phase. Regularization techniques, such as dropout and L2 regularization, are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of deep learning models.
