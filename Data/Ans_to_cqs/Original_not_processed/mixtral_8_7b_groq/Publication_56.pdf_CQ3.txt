Answer:::

Deep learning models in remote sensing often require annotated data for training. The annotations can take various forms, depending on the specific task.

For object detection tasks, bounding box annotation is commonly used. This technique involves drawing a box around the object of interest in the image. The coordinates of the box are then used as the annotation. An example of this can be found in the 2015 IEEE GRSS data fusion contest (Campos-Taberner et al., 2016), where participants had to detect specific objects in high-resolution remote sensing images.

For semantic segmentation tasks, where the goal is to classify each pixel in the image, instance segmentation is often used. This is a more detailed form of annotation where each instance of a class is separately segmented and labeled. Liu et al. (2017) used this technique in their hourglass-shaped network for high-resolution aerial imagery. They annotated each instance of a class (like buildings, trees, etc.) in the image separately.

In some cases, a combination of these techniques is used. For example, Zhou et al. (2016) used bounding box annotation for object detection and then used the detected boxes for learning deep features for discriminative localization.

In addition to these techniques, there are also other annotation methods like pixel-level annotation, where each pixel is labeled with a class, and scatterplot annotation, where points are scattered on the image and each point represents a certain class.

It's also worth noting that there are efforts to automate the annotation process using techniques like active learning, where the model selects the most informative samples for annotation, and weakly supervised learning, where the model learns from noisy or incomplete annotations.

In conclusion, the choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the level of detail required. Bounding box annotation and instance segmentation are commonly used in remote sensing deep learning applications.
