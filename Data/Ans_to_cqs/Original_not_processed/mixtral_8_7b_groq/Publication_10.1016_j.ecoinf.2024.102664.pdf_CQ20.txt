Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It includes details about the deep learning models used, such as the CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM models, as well as the solvers and input time series lengths used for training. However, it does not mention any details about the hardware resources used for this training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
