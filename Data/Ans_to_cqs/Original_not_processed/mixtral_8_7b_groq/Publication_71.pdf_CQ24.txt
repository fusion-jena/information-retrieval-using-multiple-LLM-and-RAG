The provided context does not include specific information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does discuss other challenges and considerations when using deep learning methods, such as handling imbalanced datasets and ensuring the availability of sufficient and appropriate training data.

In deep learning, randomness can be introduced in various stages of the pipeline, including data shuffling, weight initialization, and dropout regularization. A random seed value can be set to ensure reproducibility of the results by controlling the randomness in these stages. Although the provided context does not mention the use of a random seed value specifically, it is a common and important practice to handle randomness in deep learning.

To address the issue of imbalanced datasets, the context suggests strategies such as adjusting the class weights, using a focal loss function, and oversampling or undersampling the minority or majority class. These techniques can help reduce the bias towards the overrepresented classes and improve the classification performance for the underrepresented classes.

The context also emphasizes the need for a large and appropriate training dataset for deep learning methods to yield good performance. It suggests potential strategies for augmenting the training dataset, such as using different brightness levels, adding horizontally and vertically flipped versions, shifting, rotating, or adding noisy versions of the training images. These techniques can help increase the diversity and size of the training dataset, improving the model's ability to generalize to new and unseen data.

In summary, while the provided context does not include specific information about handling randomness using a random seed value in the deep learning pipeline, it is an important practice to ensure reproducibility of the results. The context discusses other strategies for handling imbalanced datasets and augmenting the training dataset to improve the performance of deep learning methods.
