Answer:::

The provided context discusses a two-step "embedded" covariate selection procedure aimed at optimizing the predictive ability and parsimony of species distribution models in a high-dimensional candidate covariate space. However, it does not mention any optimization techniques typically used in deep learning pipelines, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.

The described procedure combines a collinearity-filtering algorithm (Step A) with three model-specific embedded regularization techniques (Step B): Generalized Linear Model with Elastic Net Regularization, Generalized Additive Model with Null-space Penalization, and Guided Regularized Random Forest. These techniques are used for covariate selection and model fitting, not for optimizing deep learning models.

In summary, the provided context does not discuss optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines like SGD or Adam.
