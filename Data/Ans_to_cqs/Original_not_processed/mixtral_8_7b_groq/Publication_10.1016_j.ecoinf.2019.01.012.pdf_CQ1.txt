Answer:::

The initial step in the deep learning pipeline involves the collection of raw data. While the provided context does not go into specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention some sources of data such as labeled training data, repeat photography, and public datasets.

Labeled training data is a crucial component of deep learning, as it enables the model to learn and extract relevant features necessary for classification. The context suggests that large quantities of labeled training data are required for deep learning models to recognize the relevant features that distinguish between classes.

Repeat photography is another source of data mentioned in the context. Repeat photography involves taking photographs of the same location or object at different points in time. This technique has been used in the natural sciences to document changes in landscapes, glaciers, and landslides. For instance, Khan et al. (2013) documented five years of landsliding after the 2005 Kashmir earthquake using repeat photography. Similarly, Molnia (2010) used repeat photography to document changes in Alaskan glaciers and landscapes.

Public datasets are another potential source of raw data for deep learning. The context does not provide specific examples of public datasets used in deep learning, but it is mentioned that transfer learning, which involves using pre-trained models on new datasets, has become a popular approach in deep learning. Weiss et al. (2016) provide a survey of transfer learning, which highlights its potential for improving the performance of deep learning models.

In summary, while the provided context does not go into specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest that labeled training data, repeat photography, and public datasets are potential sources of raw data.
