Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets, are not specified in the provided context. However, based on common practices in deep learning and machine learning, there are several standard methods for splitting data.

One approach is to divide the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used for tuning hyperparameters and model selection, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model performance. This approach allows for an independent assessment of the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

Another common method is k-fold cross-validation. In k-fold cross-validation, the dataset is divided into k equal-sized folds. The model is then trained on k-1 folds while one fold is held out as a validation set. This process is repeated k times, with each fold serving as the validation set once. The average performance across the k runs is used as the final model performance. This method reduces the risk of overfitting and provides a more robust estimate of model performance.

In the context of the study mentioned, they used a cross-validation analysis to test their approach. However, it is not explicitly stated whether they used k-fold cross-validation or a different method for splitting the data.

In summary, while the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not provided in the context, common methods include dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets or using k-fold cross-validation.
