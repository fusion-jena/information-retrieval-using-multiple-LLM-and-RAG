The provided context discusses the use of bagging and random forests for reducing the variance of estimated forecast functions, but it does not directly address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general techniques used to address data bias, which include:

1. Stratified sampling: This technique ensures that each subset (e.g., training, validation, or testing) has approximately the same percentage of samples for each class as the original dataset. This can help maintain balance in the presence of class imbalance.

2. Oversampling: In cases where one class has significantly fewer samples than others, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from the minority class. This can be done by randomly duplicating samples from the minority class or using more advanced techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

3. Undersampling: Alternatively, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of instances from the majority class, so that the number of samples from both classes is balanced. However, this technique may result in loss of valuable information.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population can help reduce bias. This includes considering factors like geographical location, demographics, and other relevant variables.

5. Data augmentation: This technique generates new synthetic samples by applying transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping) to the existing dataset. This can help increase the size of the dataset and reduce overfitting.

6. Reweighing samples: In some cases, it might be beneficial to assign different weights to samples based on their class or other factors. This can help reduce the impact of biased samples during training.

In summary, while the provided context does not discuss techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, there are several general techniques available for this purpose. These include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection, data augmentation, and reweighing samples.
