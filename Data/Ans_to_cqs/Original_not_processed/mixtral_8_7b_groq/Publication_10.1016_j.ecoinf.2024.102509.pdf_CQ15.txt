The text provided does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) model. However, it does mention that the 'neuralnet' package of R 4.1.2 software was used for developing the BP-ANN model. This package uses a type of optimization algorithm called Backpropagation for training the model.

Backpropagation is a supervised learning algorithm used to train neural networks by minimizing the error between the predicted and actual output. It works by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases of the network, and then adjusting the weights and biases in the direction of the negative gradient. This process is repeated until the error between the predicted and actual output is minimized.

In addition to Backpropagation, there are other optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, etc.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an optimization algorithm that is used to update the parameters of a model by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to a single training example, rather than the entire training dataset. This makes SGD faster and more memory-efficient than other optimization algorithms.

Adam is an optimization algorithm that is a combination of SGD and other techniques such as momentum and adaptive learning rate. It is widely used in deep learning pipelines due to its ability to converge quickly and efficiently.

RMSprop is another optimization algorithm that is similar to Adam, but it uses a different method for computing the learning rate. It is also widely used in deep learning pipelines.

In summary, the text provided does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the BP-ANN model. However, it is mentioned that the 'neuralnet' package of R 4.1.2 software was used for developing the BP-ANN model, which uses Backpropagation as an optimization algorithm. Other optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.
