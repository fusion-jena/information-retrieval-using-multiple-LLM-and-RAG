Based on the provided context, there is no information about a specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the studies mentioned. The studies discussed are related to the Amur tigers and leopards in China, lowland tapir in South America, and giant panda in China. These studies used various methods and techniques for data analysis, including Field Keyinformatics (FIT) and spatial capture-recapture models.

The studies were published in different journals, including Landscape Ecology, Biological Conservation, and Ecological Informatics. However, none of the publications mentioned a specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline.

It is possible that the data repository is not publicly available due to ethical or privacy concerns related to the study species. In some cases, researchers may choose to share their data upon request or after the publication of their research.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query regarding the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. I recommend contacting the authors of the studies or the journal editors for more information on the availability of the data.
