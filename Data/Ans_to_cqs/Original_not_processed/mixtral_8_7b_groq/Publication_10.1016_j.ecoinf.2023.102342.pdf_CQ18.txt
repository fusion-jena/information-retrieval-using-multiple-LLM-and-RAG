Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The text focuses on the overall Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, including data acquisition, processing, and analysis for identifying patterns or relationships in a dataset, specifically for monitoring pesticides in water bodies in Puglia.

The KDD process includes various steps, such as identifying the aim of the study, pre-selecting useful data, applying analytical determinations, optimizing and elaborating results, mapping and interpreting results, displaying results in an understandable format, and decision-making. However, none of these steps specifically mention monitoring the model performance during training.

In general, monitoring model performance during training can involve techniques such as using validation datasets, tracking metrics like accuracy, loss, or other performance measures, and employing early stopping strategies if the model's performance on the validation set does not improve after a certain number of training iterations. However, without further information from the text, it is not possible to determine if any of these techniques were used in this particular case.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
