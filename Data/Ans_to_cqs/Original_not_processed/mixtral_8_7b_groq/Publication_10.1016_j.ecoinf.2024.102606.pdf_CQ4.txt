The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as described in the context, include Random crop, Mosaic, and various color distortions such as brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, Gaussian blur, Random scaling, Random rotation, and Random horizontal flipping. These techniques are used to artificially increase the size of the dataset, reduce the risk of overfitting, make the model more reliable on a wider range of input data, and save time by reducing the need to collect a bigger dataset. They help recreate the state of old microscope slides on new ones, which improves results on old projects. In this particular study, these data augmentation techniques were used during the training of models for the identification of Collembola on a new manually annotated dataset.
