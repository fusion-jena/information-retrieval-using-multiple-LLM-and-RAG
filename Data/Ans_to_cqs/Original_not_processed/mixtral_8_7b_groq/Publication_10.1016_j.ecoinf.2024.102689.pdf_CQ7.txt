Answer:

The context provided discusses various applications of deep learning, particularly in the field of aquaculture and marine biology, but it does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for model training. However, it does mention the use of cross-validation, a common method used in machine learning for assessing the performance of a model and avoiding overfitting.

In k-fold cross-validation, the dataset is divided into 'k' subsets or folds. The model is then trained on 'k-1' folds while one fold is held back for validation. This process is repeated 'k' times, each time with a different fold used for validation. The performance of the model is then averaged across all 'k' trials to get a more robust estimate of its performance.

In the context of the query, this method could be used to split the data into a training set and a validation set. The training set would be used to train the model, while the validation set would be used to tune the model's parameters and prevent overfitting.

Furthermore, in deep learning, it's also common to use a separate test set, disjoint from the training and validation sets. This test set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data after the model has been trained and validated.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it does suggest the use of cross-validation, a method that involves splitting the data into a training set and a validation set. Additionally, in deep learning, it's common to use a separate test set for final performance evaluation.
