Answer:::

Based on the given context, there is no information provided about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the paper "Forest Species Classification of UAV Hyperspectral Image Using Deep Learning". The authors, Jing Liang, Lu Han, Pengshuai Li, Hui Zhao, and Mingliang Qu, proposed a spectral-spatial paralleled convolutional neural network (SSPCNN) for forest species classification using hyperspectral images (HSIs) captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, the text does not mention any code repository or open-source platform where the implementation of the SSPCNN can be found.

It is common for researchers to share their code and data to promote reproducibility and facilitate further development. However, it might take some time after the publication for the authors to make the code available publicly. If you are interested in the implementation of the SSPCNN, you can contact the authors directly using their email addresses provided in the paper. They might be able to share the code or guide you on how to implement it.

Additionally, you can search for similar deep learning pipelines for hyperspectral image classification on popular code repositories such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. You can use keywords such as "hyperspectral image classification", "convolutional neural network", "UAV", and "deep learning" to find relevant repositories. While these repositories might not contain the exact implementation of the SSPCNN, they can serve as a starting point for understanding how to implement deep learning pipelines for hyperspectral image classification.
