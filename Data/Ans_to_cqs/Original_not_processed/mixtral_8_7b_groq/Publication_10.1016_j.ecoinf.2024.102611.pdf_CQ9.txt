Based on the provided context, there is no clear information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline for medicinal plant identification. The sources mention several self-built datasets and the use of external datasets like Mendeley dataset, but they do not specify where these datasets are stored or how they can be accessed. It is possible that the data repositories are not publicly available or were not disclosed in the mentioned sources. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
