Answer:::
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the use of the SOFM neural network for identifying ecological sources and setting scenarios, as well as the classification and distribution of ecological corridors in Guangzhou. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link associated with it. I hope this information is helpful.
