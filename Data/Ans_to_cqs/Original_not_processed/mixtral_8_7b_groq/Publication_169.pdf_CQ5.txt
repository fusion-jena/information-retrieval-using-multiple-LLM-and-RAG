The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline for plant species identification is the "One-hundred plant species leaves data set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset consists of images of plant leaves that appear in controlled backlit and front-lit versions, with several samples per species. The images vary in sharpness, noise, illumination patterns, and shadows.

The dataset is not large enough for deep learning to overcome the problem of overfitting, so data augmentation was used to enlarge the dataset for training and overcoming network overfitting. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, width and height shifts, shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping were applied to the original images to create new ones.

The dataset contains 16 features, including the area, perimeter, major axis length, minor axis length, compactness, convex area, convex perimeter, eccentricity, and others. These features were extracted from the plant leaf images using the proposed network system, which consists of 20 layers, including 12 convolutional layers, five pooling layers, one Fully Connected layer, one LSTM layer, and one output layer with the softmax function for classification.

The convolutional layer with a size of 3 × 3 kernels is used for extracting features and is activated by the ReLU function. The max-pooling layer with a size of 2 × 2 kernels is applied to reduce the dimensions of an input image. The function map is then shifted to the LSTM layer for information extraction and classification purposes.

The input size of the LSTM layer is (196,512) after reshaping. The model sorts the plant species images through a fully connected layer to predict whether they belong under any of the 100 categories of the plant species.

In summary, the "One-hundred plant species leaves data set" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline for plant species identification. Data augmentation techniques were applied to enlarge the dataset for training and overcoming network overfitting. The proposed network system consists of 20 layers, including convolutional, pooling, Fully Connected, LSTM, and output layers, for feature extraction and classification purposes.
