Answer:::

The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validation of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the data splitting approach might not be traditional due to the use of random ten crop testing and data augmentation techniques.

In the context, it is mentioned that for the Google Search Image dataset, they select the labels with more than 12 images and automatically retrieve the first 10 images returned by the Google Image Search engine. This suggests that the data for the Google Search Image dataset might be split based on the number of images available for each label, using a larger portion of the data for training and a smaller part for testing.

For the Portuguese Flora dataset, the context mentions that they select 15,000 images belonging to one of the 1,300 species present in their training dataset. This implies that the data for the Portuguese Flora dataset might be split based on the species, using images from some species for training and images from the same species for testing.

Moreover, during the training of the ResNet50 model, the context mentions that they apply standard data augmentation techniques such as sheer, translation, and mirror. This suggests that the training data might be augmented on-the-fly, effectively increasing the size of the training set and allowing the model to learn more robust features.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information about the data splitting approach, it can be inferred that the data splitting for the Google Search Image dataset might be based on the number of images available for each label, and for the Portuguese Flora dataset, it might be based on the species. Additionally, the training data might be augmented on-the-fly during the training process.
