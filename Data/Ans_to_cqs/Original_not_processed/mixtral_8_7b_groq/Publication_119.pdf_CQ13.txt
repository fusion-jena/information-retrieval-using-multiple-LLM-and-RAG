Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, specifically the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model, include the learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size. The learning rate was optimized to 0.007, and the batch size was optimized to 48. However, the specific type of optimizer used in this model is not mentioned in the provided context.

Additionally, the DNN model includes batch normalization layers to reduce overfitting and increase the model's generalization on testing data. The network architecture consists of hidden layers with an optimized number of neurons, and the output layer contains 11 neurons corresponding to the number of classes to be classified.

It's worth noting that the context also mentions a U-Net model implemented within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python. The U-Net model's hyperparameters include an input patch size of 64 Ã— 64 pixels and a ResNet-50 backbone. The ResNet-50 backbone in the U-Net model is pretrained on ImageNet to improve classification accuracies further. The U-Net model's hyperparameters were optimized to produce the best model for the given task.

Therefore, the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models mentioned in the context include learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, input patch size, and the type of backbone used in the model. However, the specific type of optimizer used in the DNN model is not mentioned.
