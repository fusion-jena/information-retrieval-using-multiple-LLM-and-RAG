Answer:::
While the provided context does not give specific details about the exact deep learning framework used for building the model, it does mention some techniques and architectures that are incorporated into the model. For instance, it talks about using Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings and modifying the architecture of models like YOLO. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch are popular deep learning frameworks that support such techniques and architectures. Therefore, it can be inferred that either TensorFlow or PyTorch (or possibly both) could be used as the deep learning framework to build the model, but the specific framework is not explicitly stated in the context.
