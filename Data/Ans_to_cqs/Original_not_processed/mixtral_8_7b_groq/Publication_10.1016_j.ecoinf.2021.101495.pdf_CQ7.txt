Answer:::

The data is split into four major modules in the computing infrastructure used to train the deep learning models. The second module is where the segmentation and species classification models' training and statistical validation take place. This module involves a train/test split in the data.

The train/test split ratio for the segmentation model is 0.9/0.1, and for the classification model, it is 0.8/0.2. This means that 90% of the data is used for training the segmentation model, and the remaining 10% is used for testing. For the classification model, 80% of the data is used for training, and the remaining 20% is used for testing.

This information is provided in the context where the computing infrastructure, search space, and best assignments of hyperparameters of the neural networks are described. In this table, the train/test split is specified for both the segmentation and classification models.

Another important aspect to note is that the data splitting strategy used here is a form of k-fold cross-validation, specifically 5-fold cross-validation. This technique involves dividing the data into k folds, where k-1 folds are used for training, and the remaining fold is used for testing. This process is repeated k times, each time with a different fold used for testing. The results are then averaged to get a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

In summary, the data is split into four major modules, with the segmentation and classification models' training and statistical validation taking place in the second module. The train/test split ratio for the segmentation model is 0.9/0.1, and for the classification model, it is 0.8/0.2. Additionally, the data splitting strategy used here is a form of k-fold cross-validation, specifically 5-fold cross-validation.
