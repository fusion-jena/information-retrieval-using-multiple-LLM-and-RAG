Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization method. The text focuses on describing the network setup, data sets used, and the evaluation metrics for the model's performance in plant species cover investigations.

The network setup includes a ResNet50 model with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), which is used in three phases with phase-specific parameters. The model is initialized with ImageNet weights and uses the AdamW optimizer. However, the context does not mention any details about the optimization of hyperparameters.
