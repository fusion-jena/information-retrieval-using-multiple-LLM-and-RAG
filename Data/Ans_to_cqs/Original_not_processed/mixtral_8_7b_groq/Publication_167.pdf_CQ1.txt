The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some types of data that are used in the study, such as land use (LU) type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to settlements, distance to roads, distance to rivers, and probability maps.

It can be inferred that some of these data may have been collected through remote sensing techniques, such as satellite imagery, which is commonly used for land use classification and soil mapping. Remote sensing can provide large-scale data over a long time span, which is consistent with the description of the training data in the study.

Additionally, some data may have been collected through field surveys, such as measurements of elevation, slope, and aspect. Surveys can provide detailed and accurate data, but they can be time-consuming and expensive, especially for large areas.

Furthermore, some data may have been obtained from public datasets, such as those provided by government agencies or research institutions. Public datasets can be a valuable resource for researchers, as they provide access to large amounts of data that have been collected and processed by experts.

Overall, while the provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data, it is likely that a combination of remote sensing, field surveys, and public datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline.
