The provided context does not specifically mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does provide information about the evaluation of word embedding models in general.

In the context, the authors use the pre-trained Baroni word2vec model to perform a semantic analysis of hikers' perceptions of outdoor experiences. The authors chose this pre-trained model because training a new custom word2vec model requires a large dataset, increases computational effort, and could be biased by the geographic origin of the data.

While the context does not explicitly mention the evaluation metrics used for the word embedding models, it does provide information about the quality of the models. For instance, the authors mention that the Baroni word2vec model produces the best results regarding semantic similarity tasks. Additionally, the gen.de/z2/LSAspaces model, which is based on the CBOW algorithm, generates high-quality performance with dense word vectors and covers a broad variety of different topics.

In the context, the authors do not mention the evaluation metrics used for deep learning models specifically. However, in general, deep learning models can be evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC). These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models, including deep learning models.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the evaluation metrics used for deep learning models, it is reasonable to assume that the models were evaluated using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
