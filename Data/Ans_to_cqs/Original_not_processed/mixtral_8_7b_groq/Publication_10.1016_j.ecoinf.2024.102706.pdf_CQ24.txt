Answer:::

The provided context discusses machine learning models and their parameters, including LightGBM, but it does not mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. Deep learning pipelines may involve different strategies to manage randomness, and these strategies might not be directly applicable to the specific machine learning models discussed in the context.

Deep learning models often employ randomness in various stages of the training process, such as initializing weights, shuffling training data, or dropout regularization. A common method to control randomness is by setting a random seed value. This ensures consistent and reproducible results across multiple runs by fixing the random number generator's starting point.

In the context, the machine learning models mentioned are LightGBM, XGboost, RF, SVM, and Enet. Among these, LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that utilizes a unique sampling method called Gradient-Based One Side Sampling (GBOSS) for more efficient tree growth. While the context provides details about the models' parameters and functioning, it does not discuss any randomness handling strategies specific to these models or deep learning pipelines.

Answer:::

In summary, the provided context does not mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. Different deep learning pipelines might have their unique ways of managing randomness, and these strategies may not be directly related to the machine learning models discussed in the context.
