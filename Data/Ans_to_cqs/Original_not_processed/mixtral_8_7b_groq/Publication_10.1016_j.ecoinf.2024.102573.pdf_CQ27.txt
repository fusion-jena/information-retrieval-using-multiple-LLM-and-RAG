Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the models were likely serialized and saved for later use, as it is a common practice in machine learning projects.

The context discusses the comparison of different frontends for bird species recognition, including learnable frontends such as LEAF-P and SincNet-P. These frontends were used to extract features from the audio data, which were then fed into a deep learning model for classification. After training and evaluating the models, the results were analyzed and summarized.

Therefore, it can be assumed that after training and evaluating the models, they were serialized and saved for later use. Model serialization is the process of saving the model's architecture, weights, and other relevant information into a file, which can be later loaded and used for making predictions.

As for the platform selection, there is no information provided in the context about where or how the models were deployed. It is possible that the models were deployed on a local machine for further analysis or integrated into a larger system for real-time bird species recognition.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the models were likely serialized and saved for later use. However, there is no information provided about the platform selection or deployment environment.
