Answer:::

The evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning models in the given study include Mean Loss, Test Rmse, and Test A10%DQ.

Mean Loss, also referred to as simply Loss, is an important metric that is relevant to the ecological model and is the objective function minimized during model training. It is calculated as the average of the difference between the predicted and actual values for a given model, species, and sites.

Test Rmse (Root Mean Square Error) is a measure of the differences between the predicted and actual values. It is calculated as the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values for a given model and test set.

Test A10%DQ (10% Asymmetric Quantile Skill Score) is a measure of the model's ability to predict the extreme values of the response variable. It is calculated as the difference between the quantiles of the predicted and actual values, with a focus on the 10th percentile.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the LGL, mono-response DNN, multi-response DNN, SNN, and CNN models. The study found that the CNN model outperforms all other models for every version and for all metrics, and that the multi-response DNN outperforms MAXENT in test Rmse in every version. The study also notes that the improvement of the performance of the DNN and CNN models for te.Loss and te.Rmse when the number of species in output increases suggests that the multi-response regularization is efficient when the model is complex or the input dimensionality is important.

It is important to note that these metrics are specific to this study and the dataset used, and may not be directly comparable to other studies or datasets. Additionally, these metrics do not include accuracy, precision, or recall, which are commonly used evaluation metrics for deep learning models.
