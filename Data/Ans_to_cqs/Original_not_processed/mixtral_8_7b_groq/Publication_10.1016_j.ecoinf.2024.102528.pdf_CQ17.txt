Answer:::

The provided context does not contain specific information about the regularization methods used in the deep learning pipelines of the studies mentioned. However, I can provide some general information about common regularization techniques used in deep learning to prevent overfitting.

Dropout is a regularization technique used in deep learning models, particularly in neural networks. During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero, effectively preventing the network from relying too much on specific input features and reducing overfitting. This helps the model generalize better to unseen data.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is another common technique used to prevent overfitting. It adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the model's weights. By increasing the loss for larger weights, L2 regularization encourages the model to have smaller weights, making it less likely to overfit the training data.

Early stopping is another regularization technique that can be used during the training process. It involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training and stopping the training process once the performance on the validation set starts to degrade. This helps prevent the model from overfitting to the training data.

Data augmentation is another technique used to prevent overfitting. It involves artificially increasing the size of the training set by applying random transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, scaling, or flipping. This helps the model learn to be invariant to these transformations and reduces overfitting.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific regularization techniques used in the studies, common regularization methods used in deep learning to prevent overfitting include dropout, L2 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation.
