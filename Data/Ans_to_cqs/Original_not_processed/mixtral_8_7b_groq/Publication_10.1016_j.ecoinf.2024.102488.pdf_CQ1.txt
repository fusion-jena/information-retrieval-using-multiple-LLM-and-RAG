Answer:

The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline in the studies provided include remote sensing through sensors and public datasets. Specifically, the studies used a combination of multi-source remote sensing data, including GF-1 optical imagery, GF-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, and MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imagery (Liu et al., 2019). These remote sensing data were captured using wide-format WFV cameras, multispectral sensors, and SAR sensors. The GF-1 multispectral images have four bands of blue, green, red, and near-infrared with a spatial resolution of 16 m. The GF-3 SAR imagery, on the other hand, uses microwave radiation to capture images and is not limited by weather conditions, allowing for data collection even during cloudy or rainy days. The MODIS NDVI imagery provides vegetation index data, which is useful for land cover classification and monitoring vegetation health. These remote sensing data are publicly available through the China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application.

In addition to remote sensing data, the studies also utilized data from field surveys. For instance, Li et al. (2021) conducted field surveys to collect data on mangrove forests, which were then used to validate the accuracy of their mapping model. Similarly, Lang and Kasischke (2008) used field survey data to monitor forested wetland hydrology in Maryland's coastal plain.

Furthermore, the studies used data fusion algorithms to combine and process the multi-source remote sensing data. For example, Li et al. (2021) used a data fusion algorithm to map multi-layered mangroves from multispectral, hyperspectral, and LiDAR data. This data fusion algorithm allows for the integration of data from different sources and sensors, improving the accuracy and robustness of the deep learning models.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline in the studies provided include remote sensing through sensors such as optical, SAR, and multispectral imagery, as well as public datasets like MODIS NDVI imagery. Additionally, the studies used data from field surveys to validate their models and collected data from different sources using data fusion algorithms.
