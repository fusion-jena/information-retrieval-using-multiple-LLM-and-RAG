Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix. However, the context does mention some details about the model training and validation performance.

The model was trained on a small-size dataset without data augmentation, and it was feasible to achieve good training results and perform well in the validation set using the MG and MO models. The experiments were conducted using original images and background-removed images, and both models had almost the same validation performance, reaching 98% accuracy.

The MG dataset led to better performance on the test sets, indicating a better ability to generalize to these test sets. The context also provides information about the pre-processing steps, such as removing the green background from the images, resizing the images, and normalizing the pixel values.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps, it is common practice in machine learning and computer vision tasks to calculate various metrics, generate saliency maps, and create confusion matrices for further analysis and evaluation of the model performance. These steps would typically be carried out after the training and validation stages and could provide valuable insights into the model's behavior and its ability to generalize to new data.
