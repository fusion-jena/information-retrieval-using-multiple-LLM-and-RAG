Answer:::

The provided context discusses a specific hyperparameter, λ, used in a deep learning model. λ is used to adjust the balance relationship between the nonlinear factors of the activation function and the identity mapping of the function based on the number of training iterations. Specifically, λ is expressed as λ = e^E, where e represents the current number of rounds of training and E represents the total number of rounds of model training. As the training progresses and e approaches E, λ approaches 1, and the nonlinear factors are gradually integrated into the generalized model.

However, the context does not mention other common hyperparameters used in deep learning models, such as learning rate or optimizer. The learning rate is a hyperparameter that determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. The optimizer is a method that updates the parameters of the model based on the gradient of the loss function. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.

Therefore, while the context provides information on a specific hyperparameter used in a deep learning model, it does not cover other important hyperparameters such as learning rate and optimizer.
