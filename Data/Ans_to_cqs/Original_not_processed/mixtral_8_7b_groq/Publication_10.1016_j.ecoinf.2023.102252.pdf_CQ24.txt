The provided context does not contain information about deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The text focuses on the use of the FERM model for environmental flow analysis and riparian ecosystem management.

However, I can provide some general strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines:

1. **Fixed random seed:** To ensure reproducibility, set a fixed random seed value at the beginning of your pipeline. This ensures that weight initializations, data shuffling, and other random processes are consistent across multiple runs.

2. **Data augmentation:** Techniques like cropping, rotation, flipping, and adding noise can help increase the size and diversity of your training dataset, reducing overfitting and improving generalization.

3. **Regularization:** Techniques like L1/L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping can help prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.

4. **Ensemble methods:** Training multiple models with different random initializations and combining their predictions can help reduce the impact of randomness on your final results.

5. **Cross-validation:** Splitting your data into multiple folds for training and validation can help assess model performance and reduce overfitting.

6. **Bootstrapping:** Resampling your data with replacement can help estimate the variability of your model's performance and provide a more robust assessment of its generalization capabilities.

These strategies can help manage randomness and improve the performance and reproducibility of deep learning pipelines.
