Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this particular process. The text focuses on the two-phase training process of a classification model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the subsequent tuning of risk thresholds for each class.

However, in general machine learning practice, training is often considered complete when the validation loss plateaus or starts to decrease very slowly. This indicates that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data and is not likely to improve its performance significantly by continuing to train. Other criteria might include monitoring the performance on a separate validation set or using early stopping techniques to prevent overfitting.

In the context provided, it is possible that the training is complete after the first phase, where a classification model is built by training a CNN on a given database T0. Alternatively, the training could be considered complete after the second phase, where the risk threshold for each class is tuned using an independent database T1.

Without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query. However, it is important to note that the choice of criteria for determining when training is complete can significantly impact the performance and generalizability of the model.
