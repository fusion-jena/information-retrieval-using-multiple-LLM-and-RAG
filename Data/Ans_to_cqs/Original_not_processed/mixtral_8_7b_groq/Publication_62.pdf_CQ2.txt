Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in the given context involves the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification. The specific data formats used in this pipeline are images.

In the first CNN, referred to as the unstained/stained CNN, the images are digitized natural color images with an RGB256 format. This CNN is used to differentiate between stained and unstained images. The input images have a size of 3×256×256, where the first value represents the color channels (Red, Green, Blue), and the other two values represent the height and width of the image.

In the second CNN, referred to as the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN, the images are again digitized natural color images with an RGB256 format. This CNN is used to differentiate between clubmoss and spikemoss images. The input images have a size of 3×256×256, similar to the unstained/stained CNN.

The data type for both CNNs is a 3-tensor, which is a multi-dimensional array with three dimensions representing the color channels, height, and width of the images.

The annotated notebooks for both CNNs are provided in PDF format (Suppl. materials 2 and 4), which include descriptions and explanations of the code used to define and train the CNNs. The actual code used to define and train the CNNs is provided in Mathematica notebook format (Suppl. materials 1 and 3).

Therefore, the data formats used in this deep learning pipeline are digitized natural color images with an RGB256 format, specifically for the purpose of image classification using CNNs.
