Unfortunately, the context provided does not specify where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. The text mentions that the bug-picture database was used for training a convolutional neural network (AN) in MATLAB and classical machine-learning algorithms in Python using the scikit-learn toolbox. However, it does not provide information about the data repository or sharing platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
