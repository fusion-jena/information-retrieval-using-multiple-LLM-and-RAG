Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text describes the use of a novel transfer learning methodology for predicting a nation's GDP using its carbon emission data. It also mentions the use of deep learning and data augmentation techniques in previous studies. However, there is no mention of a data repository or link where the data and code for the deep learning pipeline used in this study can be found. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific answer to this query.
