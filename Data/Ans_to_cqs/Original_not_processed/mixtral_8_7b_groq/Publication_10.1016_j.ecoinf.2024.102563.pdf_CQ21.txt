Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention some metrics calculation such as overall accuracy and Kappa index in the context of a land cover classification study using MLC, SVM, ANN, and RF methods.

In general, postprocessing steps after model training can include various methods for evaluating the performance of the model, such as:

1. Metrics calculation: This includes calculating various metrics such as overall accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Kappa index. These metrics provide a quantitative measure of the performance of the model.
2. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It compares the predicted labels with the actual labels and provides a breakdown of where the model made errors.
3. Saliency maps: Saliency maps are a way of visualizing the parts of an input that a model is paying attention to. They can be useful for understanding how a model is making its predictions.
4. Model interpretation: This involves interpreting the model's coefficients or weights to understand which features are most important for the model's predictions.

In the context of the provided study, the authors have calculated the overall accuracy and Kappa index for various methods using multi-textural features with an optimal window. However, there is no information about other postprocessing steps such as confusion matrix or saliency maps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after model training include metrics calculation such as overall accuracy and Kappa index. However, there is no explicit information about other postprocessing steps such as confusion matrix or saliency maps.
