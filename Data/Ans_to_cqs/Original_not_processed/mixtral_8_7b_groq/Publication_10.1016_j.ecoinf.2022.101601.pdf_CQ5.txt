The provided context does not seem to contain information about deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context appears to focus on various factors related to permafrost, including soil temperature, soil water input, vegetation height, soil particle size, and others.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context. However, I can give you a brief overview of the mentioned deep learning datasets:

1. MNIST: This dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0-9) for the task of digit recognition. Each image is 28x28 pixels in grayscale.
2. CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100: These datasets contain 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 and 100 classes, respectively. CIFAR-10 has 6,000 images per class, while CIFAR-100 has 600 images per class. Both datasets have 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
3. ImageNet: This is a large-scale dataset of over 14 million images, organized according to the WordNet hierarchy, with 1,000 images per class and 100,000 classes. It is widely used for object recognition and image classification tasks.

These datasets are commonly used for training and evaluating deep learning models in computer vision tasks.
