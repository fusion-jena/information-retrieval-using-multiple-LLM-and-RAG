Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix calculation after model training. However, it does mention that the model performance is assessed using a testing set of 7554 images. This assessment likely involves calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of classification models. Additionally, the research investigates Privacy-Preserving Deep Learning (PPDL) techniques for satellite image classification, so there may be postprocessing steps related to the application of these techniques. However, the context does not provide specific details about these steps.
