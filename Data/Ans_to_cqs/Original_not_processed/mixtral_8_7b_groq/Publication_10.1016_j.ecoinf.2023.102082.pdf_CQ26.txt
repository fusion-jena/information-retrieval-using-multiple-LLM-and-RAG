The provided context does not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of various data sources and fusion techniques to create high-resolution canopy height models (CHMs) using Sentinel-2 optical images, GEDI data, and other datasets.

One possible approach to address data bias could be through diverse data collection. This is alluded to in the context, where multiple data sources are used, such as Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, GEDI, Landsat 8 OLI, and high-resolution aerial imagery. By combining different data sources, the deep learning model may be exposed to a more diverse and representative set of features, which could help reduce data bias.

Another potential technique could be stratified sampling or splitting. Although not explicitly mentioned in the context, this method could be used during the training, validation, and testing of the deep learning model. Stratified sampling involves dividing the data into homogeneous subgroups (or strata) based on certain characteristics, and then randomly selecting samples from each stratum. This can help ensure that the training, validation, and testing datasets are representative of the overall data distribution and reduce bias.

The context does not mention oversampling or undersampling techniques. Oversampling involves increasing the number of samples from the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of samples from the majority class. These techniques can be used to address class imbalance and reduce bias in the dataset.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest the use of diverse data collection and possibly stratified sampling or splitting. However, it does not mention oversampling, undersampling, or other bias reduction techniques.
