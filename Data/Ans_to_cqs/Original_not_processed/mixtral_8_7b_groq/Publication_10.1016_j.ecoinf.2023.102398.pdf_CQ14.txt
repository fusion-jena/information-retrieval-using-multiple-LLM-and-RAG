The context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as whether grid search, random search, or another method was used. However, it does mention that the hyperparameters used in training the proposed model are based on the optimized values for YOLOv5 COCO training from scratch. This suggests that some optimization process was used to determine the values, but the specific method is not specified.

The hyperparameters listed in Table 2 include learning rate (lr0), learning rate decay (Lrf), momentum, weight decay, warmup epochs, warmup momentum, warmup bias learning rate, object detection parameters (box, cls, cls_pw, obj, obj_pw), and data augmentation parameters (fl_gamma, hsv_h, hsv_s, hsv_v, degrees, translate, scale, shear, perspective, flipud, fliplr, mosaic, mixup, copy_paste). These hyperparameters can have a significant impact on the performance of the model, so it is important that they are carefully chosen.

The context also mentions that the deep learning (DL) model used in this work is tuned with optimized hyperparameters to prevent overfitting and underfitting. This is typically done by using a validation set to evaluate the performance of the model during training and adjusting the hyperparameters as needed. The use of graded MSE convergence to fine-tune the model also suggests that some form of hyperparameter optimization was used.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, it does indicate that some optimization process was used to determine the values. The use of a validation set and graded MSE convergence also suggests that the hyperparameters were adjusted during training to prevent overfitting and underfitting.
