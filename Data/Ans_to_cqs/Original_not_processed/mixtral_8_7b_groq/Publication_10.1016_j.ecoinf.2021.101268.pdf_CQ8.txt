Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on introducing the Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset, its acquisition protocol, and the use of deep learning methods for plant species classification and disease detection. It mentions several papers that have worked with fine-tuned CNN-based models, pre-trained InceptionNet models, and visualization of convolution layers for leaf venations and edges. However, there is no information about the code repository used in this specific research. Therefore, I cannot provide the desired location (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) where the code repository is available.
