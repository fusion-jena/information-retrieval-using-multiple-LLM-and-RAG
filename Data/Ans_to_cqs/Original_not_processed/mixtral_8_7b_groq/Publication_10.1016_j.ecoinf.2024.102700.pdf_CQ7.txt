Answer:::
The provided context does not contain specific information about the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. However, it does discuss data splitting in the context of model validation, which is a related but distinct concept.

In the studies reviewed, internal validation of models was performed using various methods, with cross-validation being the most common approach. Among the cross-validation methods, "k-fold" was used most frequently, followed by "bootstrap," "leave-one-out CV," "repeated split sampling," and "not stated/other CV." Additionally, some studies used "simple sample splitting" or "generalized CV," which do not require data partitioning into training and test datasets.

However, the criteria used to split the data for these validation methods are not specified in the given context. In general, data splitting for model validation involves setting aside a portion of the data for testing or validation purposes, while the remaining data is used for training the model. The specific criteria used for this split, such as the proportion of data allocated to each set, may vary depending on the study and the specific research question.

In the context of deep learning, data splitting for training and validation typically involves setting aside a portion of the data for validation and testing purposes, while the remaining data is used for training the model. This split can be done randomly or using a specific strategy, such as stratified sampling, to ensure that the validation and test sets are representative of the overall data.

In summary, while the provided context does not contain specific information about the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training, it does discuss related concepts such as data splitting for model validation. In general, data splitting for deep learning involves setting aside a portion of the data for validation and testing purposes, while the remaining data is used for training the model. The specific criteria used for this split may vary depending on the study and the specific research question.
