Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. The text mentions that a CNN approach was used for classifying animal species and that a public-facing website was developed for the purpose, but it does not specify where the code for the pipeline can be found. It is possible that the authors have not made the code publicly available, or it could be that the information was not included in the provided context. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
