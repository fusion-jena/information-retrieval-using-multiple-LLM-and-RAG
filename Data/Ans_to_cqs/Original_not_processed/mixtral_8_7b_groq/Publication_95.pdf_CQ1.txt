Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of images for training deep convolutional neural networks. These images could have been collected using various methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets.

For instance, in the context of ecological applications, studies have used hyperspectral remote sensing for tracking plant invasions (He et al., 2011) and for the early detection of invasive weeds (Lass et al., 2005). These studies likely used sensors mounted on aircraft or satellites to collect the hyperspectral images.

In addition, a study by Kellenberger et al. (2020) mentions the use of "image-based ecological surveys" for monitoring invasive plant species, which suggests the use of cameras or other imaging devices to collect the data.

Furthermore, the study by Redmon and Farhadi (2018) on YOLOv3, a real-time object detection system, uses the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset for training and testing. The COCO dataset is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset, which contains images collected from various sources, including Flickr and Amazon.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data, it is likely that a variety of methods, including surveys, sensors, and public datasets, were used depending on the specific application and dataset.
