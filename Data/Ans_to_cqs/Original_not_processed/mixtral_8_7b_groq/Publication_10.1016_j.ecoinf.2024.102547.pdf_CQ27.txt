Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on the analysis of a multifrequency acoustics dataset using Functional Data Analysis (FDA) and comparing the results with and without the incorporation of spatial dimensions.

The context includes the R-squared and root mean square error (RMSE) values for both train and test datasets, indicating the performance of the FDA model. However, there is no information about the deep learning model, such as its architecture, training process, or deployment details.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
