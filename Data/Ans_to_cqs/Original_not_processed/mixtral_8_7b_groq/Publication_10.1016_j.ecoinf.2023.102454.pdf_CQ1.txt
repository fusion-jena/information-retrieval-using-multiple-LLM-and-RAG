Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in the study by Zhang et al. (n.d.) utilizes a combination of public datasets, statistical data, and spatial data for raw data collection.

Firstly, the study uses the National Earth System Science Data Centre's extended NPP-VIIRS-like NTL Data for 2000-2021 as the nighttime lighting data source. This dataset is available for free download, indicating that it is a public dataset.

Secondly, the study obtains provincial statistical energy data for 2000-2021 from the China Statistical Yearbook and municipal statistical data from the Xi'an Statistical Yearbook. These data sources are likely to be official statistical publications, which are public datasets made available by the Chinese government.

Thirdly, the study obtains carbon emission factors for various energy sources from the "2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventory." This source is a set of guidelines and methodologies developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for estimating greenhouse gas emissions. While not a public dataset in the traditional sense, it is a publicly available resource that provides standardized methods for calculating emissions.

Lastly, the study obtains administrative boundary data for Xi'an from the National Basic Geographic Information System. This source is a national database of geographic information, which provides spatial data for the study area.

Therefore, the raw data for the deep learning pipeline in this study is collected from a combination of public datasets, statistical data, and spatial data. While surveys and sensors are not explicitly mentioned as data sources, it is possible that some of the data sources used in the study may have been collected using these methods. However, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this question.
