Based on the provided context, the following measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model:

1. Diverse dataset: The model was trained on the NACTI dataset, which likely contains a variety of crops from running the MegaDetector model. However, the specifics of the dataset are not provided in the context.

2. Initial training on a small, randomly selected labeled subset of data: The model was initially trained on a small subset of the dataset, which was randomly selected. This approach can help ensure that the model is not overfitting to a specific subset of the data and is able to generalize to the broader dataset.

3. Active learning: The model's performance was improved using active learning algorithms, which involve selecting the most informative unlabeled samples to be passed to the oracle for labelling. This approach can help ensure that the model is exposed to a diverse set of samples and is able to generalize to new, unseen data.

4. Multiple query selection strategies: Five different query selection strategies were employed and compared against a control of selecting samples at random. This approach can help ensure that the model is able to generalize to different types of samples and is not biased towards a specific subset of the data.

5. Transfer learning: Although not explicitly mentioned in the context, the use of transfer learning can also contribute to the generalizability of the model. By first training the model on a large dataset and then fine-tuning it on the target dataset, the model can leverage the general features learned from the large dataset and apply them to the target dataset.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are common techniques used to ensure the generalizability of machine learning models. However, based on the other measures taken, it is likely that the model's generalizability was carefully considered during its development.
