Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information on the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models for bird species identification or image recognition.

The first source, "Deep residual learning for image recognition" by He et al., 2016, discusses a deep residual learning framework for image recognition tasks. However, it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in their model.

The second source, "BirdNET: a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring" by Kahl et al., 2021, presents a deep learning model for bird species identification using audio recordings. Although the paper discusses the architecture of their model, it does not mention the specific hyperparameters used.

The third and fourth sources, "Routes of migrating soaring birds" by Leshem and Yom-Tov, 1998, and "The history of highly-pathogenic avian influenza in Israel (H5-subtypes): from 2006 to 2023" by Lublin et al., 2023, do not involve deep learning models or hyperparameters.

The fifth source, "Increased immune marker variance in a population of invasive birds" by Melzheimer et al., 2020, focuses on immune marker variance in a population of invasive birds and does not discuss deep learning models or hyperparameters.

Lastly, the remaining sources are related to center annual reports, avian influenza resurgence, and challenges and opportunities for bioacoustics in the study of rare species in remote environments, which do not provide information on deep learning model hyperparameters.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
