Answer:::

I'm sorry, but the provided pieces of context do not include information about a deep learning pipeline or any code repository links, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The context focuses on the relationship between wild bird diversity, specific wild bird species, and the number of views on YouTube videos. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested link to the deep learning pipeline.
