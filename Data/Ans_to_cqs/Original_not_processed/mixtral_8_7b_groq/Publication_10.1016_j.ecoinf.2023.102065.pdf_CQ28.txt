Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that a convolutional neural network (CNN) model was developed and implemented for soundscape classification, and that inference was performed using this model. However, it does not specify where or how the model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
