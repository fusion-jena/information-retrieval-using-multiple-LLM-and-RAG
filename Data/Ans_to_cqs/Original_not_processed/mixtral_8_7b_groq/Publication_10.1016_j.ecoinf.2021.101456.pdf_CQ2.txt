The provided context does not give specific details about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that unlabeled input data consisting of N samples with F features (x ∈ ℝN×F) is used in a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model. This suggests that the input data is likely represented in a numerical format, such as a CSV file, where each sample is a row and each feature is a column.

Additionally, the context mentions that the input data consists of insect recordings, which implies that the data format could be audio files, such as WAV or MP3. The recordings are processed through a deep learning pipeline, which includes a VAE and other machine learning models, to extract features and reduce the parameter space while retaining necessary information.

Furthermore, the context mentions that auto-encoders (AE) have been used to extract features from acoustically recorded bird songs, which suggests that audio files are used as input data in this deep learning pipeline as well.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it implies that numerical data (e.g., CSV) and audio data (e.g., WAV, MP3) are likely used as input data.
