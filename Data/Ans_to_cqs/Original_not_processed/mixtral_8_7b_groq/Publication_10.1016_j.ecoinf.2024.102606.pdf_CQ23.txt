The generalizability of the deep learning model was addressed through several measures. First, data augmentation was used to artificially increase the size of the dataset and expose the model to more variations. This technique helps to reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize. By creating new samples from the existing ones, the model is trained more effectively, and its accuracy on the test dataset is increased.

Second, cross-validation was used to train the models. Specifically, each model underwent a 5-fold cross-validation process. Cross-validation is a powerful technique that helps to ensure that the model can generalize well to unseen data. By dividing the dataset into k-folds and training the model k times, cross-validation provides a more reliable estimate of the model's performance than using a single training and test set.

Third, the Mean Average Precision (mAP) equation was used to evaluate the models' performance. The mAP gives a score for the whole model, while the AP gives one for each species. This metric was chosen because it provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance than other metrics.

Fourth, relevant regions within the images were used for training the model. ROI pooling was used to select and analyze specific image regions for accurate object classification. This technique helps to ensure that the model focuses on the relevant features of the image and reduces the risk of overfitting.

Finally, two different versions of Faster R-CNN were created for the benchmark, Faster R-CNN (640) and Faster R-CNN (1280). After multiple tests, only the 1280 version was used in the benchmark because the important features were too small using the 640 resolution for Faster R-CNN. This step was taken to ensure that the model can handle different input dimensions and select the optimal resolution for accurate object detection.

In summary, the generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through data augmentation, cross-validation, the use of mAP, relevant regions within the images, and the creation of two different versions of Faster R-CNN. These measures help to reduce overfitting, improve the model's ability to generalize, and provide a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.
