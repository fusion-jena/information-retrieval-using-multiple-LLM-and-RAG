Answer:::
The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in the given context are Cross-Entropy Loss (CE), Focal Loss (FL), F1-score, and the Geometric Mean of True Positives and Negatives, which is referred to as G-mean.

Cross-Entropy Loss (CE) is a common metric for evaluating the performance of classification models. It measures the difference between the predicted and actual probability distributions.

Focal Loss (FL) is a modification of Cross-Entropy Loss that addresses class imbalance by reducing the loss contribution from well-classified examples. It introduces two parameters, alpha and gamma, to adjust the focus of the loss function.

The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, where precision is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives, and recall is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives.

The Geometric Mean of True Positives and Negatives, or G-mean, is a metric that evaluates the balance between the true positive and true negative rates. It is calculated as the square root of the product of the true positive rate and the true negative rate.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of various methods, including the proposed method of "Diffusion + MLP", 1D-CNN, and autoencoder. The results show that the models trained with plain Cross-Entropy Loss consistently achieve a lower or comparable performance in every metric, while the models exploiting SMOTE obtain the best performance across all metrics. The features from Beyan and Fisher (2013a; Beyan and Fisher, 2013b) combined with SVM yield the lowest results across all combinations.

Therefore, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in the given context are Cross-Entropy Loss, Focal Loss, F1-score, and G-mean.
