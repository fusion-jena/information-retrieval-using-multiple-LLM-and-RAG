Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, specifically regarding model serialization and platform selection. However, it can be inferred that the model was implemented in MATLAB, as stated in the context. MATLAB provides the capability to save trained models to a file using the `save` function and then load them back using the `load` function. This process is often referred to as model serialization, as it allows for the model to be saved and then loaded onto another platform for deployment.

Regarding platform selection, the context does not provide information on where the model was deployed. However, MATLAB allows for deployment on various platforms, including desktop computers, servers, and embedded devices. Additionally, MATLAB provides capabilities for deploying models to other languages such as C++, Python, and Java, which can then be integrated into larger software systems.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly provide information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that MATLAB was used for implementation and that the model was likely serialized using the `save` function. The platform of deployment is not specified in the context, but MATLAB provides several options for deploying models on various platforms and in other languages.
