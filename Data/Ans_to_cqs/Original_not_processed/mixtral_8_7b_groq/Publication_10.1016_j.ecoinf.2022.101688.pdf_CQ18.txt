Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the F1-score, a common metric used in literature for evaluating classification models, was used to assess the performance of the network on each testing file. The F1-score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall and is a useful metric when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

Moreover, the model's performance was evaluated on multiple network architectures, including ResNet101V2, ResNet152V2, InceptionResNetV2, ResNet50V2, DenseNet169, DenseNet201, VGG16, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, ResNet101, and Xception, among others. The performance of these architectures was averaged across 13 unique executions, and the best three performing network architectures on a particular dataset configuration were highlighted in bold.

It can also be inferred that the model training and testing were done on Microsoft Azure using the Data Science Virtual Machine and a NCv2-series virtual machine (NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU), indicating that the training process was carried out in a controlled environment.

Therefore, while the specific strategy for monitoring the model performance during training is not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that a combination of using the F1-score, evaluating multiple network architectures, and conducting the training in a controlled environment were implemented to ensure the model's performance was adequately monitored.
