Answer:::
The context provided does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of datasets from the SEIO PBW vocalizations and blue whale's Dcall, as well as the SWAMS dataset recorded during the OHASISBIO program. However, it does not specify where these datasets are available for access. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
