Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model being discussed is for hyperspectral target detection using a Multitarget Multiple-Instance learning (MTMI-SMF) approach.

MTMI-SMF is designed to work with imperfect data, which can be due to training locations having locational errors or not ideally matching with image pixels. This model groups pixels surrounding a training location that could have an invader, unlike most other machine learning algorithms that require a single pixel to represent a training location.

The primary goal of this deep learning model is to improve the classification of target species in hyperspectral images by allowing multiple pixels' spectra to be associated with a single metadata record. This approach is particularly useful when training locations do not fall near the center of a pixel.

The MTMI-SMF model is compared to a commonly used machine learning classification approach, Random Forest, which requires a single pixel's spectrum to be associated with a single metadata record. In the Random Forest model, a random pixel from the pixels in closest proximity to the training location is selected for analysis.

The deep learning model, MTMI-SMF, is designed to handle training data that is not 'pure' or 100% representative of the target invader, addressing a common issue in most machine learning approaches.

In summary, the purpose of the deep learning model, MTMI-SMF, is to improve hyperspectral target detection by allowing multiple pixels' spectra to be associated with a single metadata record, thereby improving the classification of target species, particularly when training locations are not perfectly aligned with image pixels.
