Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were optimized. Hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in training machine learning models, where different configurations of hyperparameters are tried to find the best set of parameters that yield the optimal performance of the model. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.

In the given context, the CNN hyperparameters configurations used for all four networks during training are presented in Table 1. However, there is no information on how these configurations were determined. It is possible that the hyperparameters were optimized using one of the methods mentioned above, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.

Another possibility is that the hyperparameters were set based on previous research or expert knowledge. For instance, the learning rate, which is one of the essential hyperparameters in training deep learning models, was set to 0.001 for all four networks. This value is a common choice for learning rate in deep learning and could have been determined based on previous experience.

In summary, while the context provides information on the CNN hyperparameters used in the study, it does not explicitly state how these hyperparameters were optimized. It is possible that they were optimized using grid search, random search, or another method, but the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.
