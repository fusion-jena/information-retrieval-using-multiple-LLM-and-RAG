Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for streamflow forecasting. However, it does mention several studies that use various approaches for time series forecasting and data-driven modeling in the context of water resources and hydrology.

For instance, Dehghani et al. (2023) compare the performance of LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM models for hourly short-term streamflow forecasting. Similarly, Feng et al. (2017) propose a data-driven multi-model methodology with deep feature selection for short-term wind forecasting. Wang and Ding (2003) introduce a wavelet network model for the prediction of hydrology. Santos et al. (2023) use wavelet neural networks for short- and long-term streamflow forecasting in the Mahanadi River, India. Lastly, Quilty and Adamowski (2018) address the incorrect usage of wavelet-based methods for time series analysis.

While these studies do not explicitly mention the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, they do highlight the importance of developing and assessing ecological models in the context of water resources management and the potential of data-driven modeling approaches for time series forecasting.

Therefore, while the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for streamflow forecasting are not provided in the context, it is clear that various studies have employed different data-driven modeling techniques for time series forecasting in the field of water resources and hydrology.
