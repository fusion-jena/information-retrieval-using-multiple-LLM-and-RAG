Answer:::

The text provided discusses the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning models to address the challenge of processing large volumes of data, specifically in the context of camera trap images for wildlife studies. However, it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

That being said, some techniques that are commonly used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain characteristics, and then ensuring that each subgroup is represented proportionally in both the training and testing sets. This can help to ensure that the model is not biased towards any particular subgroup.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of examples from underrepresented classes in the training data. This can help to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of examples from overrepresented classes in the training data. This can also help to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a wide variety of sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population as a whole. This can help to prevent the model from being biased towards any particular subset of the population.

While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, they are commonly used in the field of deep learning to address data bias during preprocessing. It is likely that researchers working with camera trap images and AI models would employ these techniques to ensure that their models are fair and unbiased.
