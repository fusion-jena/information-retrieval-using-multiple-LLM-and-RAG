Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, there are some implicit indications of possible techniques used during the evaluation of the frontends.

First, multiple frontends were tested, including Mel-log, Mel-pcen, Stft-log, Stft-pcen, Sinc-log, Sinc-pcen, and Leaf-log, among others. This variety of frontends might suggest that some effort was made to test the model's performance on different input representations, which could indirectly contribute to the model's generalizability.

Second, data augmentation was applied to 24 out of 48 models (Mel-log-M-A, Mel-log-S-A, Mel-pcen-M-A, Mel-pcen-S-A, Stft-log-M-A, Stft-log-S-A, Stft-pcen-M-A, Stft-pcen-S-A, Sinc-log-M-A, Sinc-log-S-A, Sinc-pcen-M-A, Sinc-pcen-S-A, Leaf-log-M-A, Leaf-log-S-A, Leaf-pcen-M-A, Leaf-pcen-S-A). Data augmentation is a common technique to increase the diversity of the training set and improve a model's ability to generalize.

Third, different normalization techniques were used, such as standardization and min-max normalization. Although the context does not explicitly mention normalization being applied to the dataset, it could be inferred that normalization was applied to the input features, which might have helped the model generalize better.

Lastly, the context mentions that the models were tested on their benchmark datasets. While this does not directly relate to generalizability, it suggests that the models were evaluated on datasets different from the training data, which could provide some insights into their performance on unseen data.

In summary, although the context does not explicitly provide information on measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, there are implicit indications of data augmentation, normalization techniques, and testing on benchmark datasets, which might indirectly contribute to the model's generalizability.
