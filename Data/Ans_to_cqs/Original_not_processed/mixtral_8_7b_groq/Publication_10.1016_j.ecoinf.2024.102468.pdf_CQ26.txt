The provided context discusses a study on whale sound recordings using WT-HMM (Wavelet Transform-Hidden Markov Model) and focuses on dataset size selection, data denoising, and data annotations. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

Answer:::

While the context does not directly address the mentioned techniques for handling data bias, it is still important to understand the relevance of these methods in a deep learning pipeline.

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria (e.g., class labels) and then ensuring that each subset is proportionally represented in the training, validation, and testing sets. Stratified splitting helps maintain balance and avoid bias in the data distribution across the different sets.

2. Oversampling: In cases where one class is underrepresented, oversampling can be used to balance the dataset by replicating instances from the minority class. This technique can help reduce bias in the model's learning process.

3. Undersampling: Alternatively, undersampling can be used to balance the dataset by reducing the number of instances from the majority class. However, this technique may lead to loss of valuable information.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources, conditions, and scenarios can help ensure that the dataset is representative and less biased. This method can improve the model's generalization capabilities and reduce overfitting.

In summary, although the provided context does not discuss these techniques explicitly, addressing data bias during preprocessing is crucial for achieving a fair and accurate deep learning model. Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are essential techniques to consider when working with biased datasets.
