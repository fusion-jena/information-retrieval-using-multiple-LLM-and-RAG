Answer:::

The provided context discusses a study that proposes a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, SeedNet, for seed image classification and retrieval. While the context does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does describe some techniques that could indirectly help manage randomness.

One such technique is the use of a fixed input image size of 224 × 224 × 3. This could help reduce variability in the input data, which in turn could help the model better manage randomness. Additionally, the use of a fixed filter size (3 × 3) and stride (1 × 1) in the max pooling strategy could also introduce a level of consistency in the data processing.

The ReLU activation function, which is applied to the output of every convolutional layer, could also help manage randomness. ReLU introduces sparsity in the network by setting negative values to zero, which could help reduce the impact of random noise in the data.

Furthermore, the use of a N-way softmax at the end of the network, where N is the number of classes in the dataset, could also help manage randomness. The softmax function converts the output of the last fully-connected layer into a probability distribution over the N classes, which could help the model make more consistent predictions.

However, the context does not provide enough information to determine if any specific strategies were used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a fixed random seed value. Therefore, without additional information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
