Answer:::

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline, as described in the given context, is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the statement that techniques employed include convolutional neural networks, which are capable of performing end-to-end classification and learning features from an input dataset with increasing complexity through the layers of the network. Furthermore, the use of U-net, which is a type of CNN specifically designed for biomedical image segmentation, is mentioned. The context also discusses the use of skip-connections between encoder and decoder layers, which is a common technique used in CNNs. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
