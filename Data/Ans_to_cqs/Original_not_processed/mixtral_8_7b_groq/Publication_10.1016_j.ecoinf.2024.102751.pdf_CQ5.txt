The provided context does not mention any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. The context focuses on a study that explores the development of a spatial modeling approach for estimating volumetric water content (VWC) in reclaimed spoil heap areas using remote sensing data and topographic indices.

The remote sensing data used in this study comes from PlanetScope satellite imagery, which is a large constellation of nanosatellites capable of imaging the globe daily with a spatial resolution of 3.7 m at the nadir. For this study, one cloud-free imagery collected on 2020-08-2
