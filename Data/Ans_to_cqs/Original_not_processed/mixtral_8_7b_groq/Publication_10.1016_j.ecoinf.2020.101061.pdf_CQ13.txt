Answer:::
 The provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate or the optimizer used in the deep learning model. The text mentions that the network was retrained using hand-annotated data for 40 epochs, and data augmentation of random flips and translations was tested. However, it does not specify the learning rate or the optimizer used during the retraining process. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
