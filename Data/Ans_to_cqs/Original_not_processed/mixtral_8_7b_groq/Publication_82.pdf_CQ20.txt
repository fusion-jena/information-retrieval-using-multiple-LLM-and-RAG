Answer:::
The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It only mentions that the experiments were conducted using a customized version of Cafe, a deep learning framework. However, it does not specify if GPUs, TPUs, or any other specific hardware accelerators were used. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
