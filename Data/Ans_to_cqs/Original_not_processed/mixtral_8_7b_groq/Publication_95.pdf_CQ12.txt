Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of a CNN architecture for image classification tasks. Specifically, two network structures were used, ResNet50V2 and DenseNet121, both of which are variants of CNNs. These networks were trained on five different image sizes, and their performance was evaluated on a validation set. The training process involved using the Adam optimizer, cross-entropy loss, and balancing the training set by upsampling the underrepresented classes. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in this pipeline is a CNN.
