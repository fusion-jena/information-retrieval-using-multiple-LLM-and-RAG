Based on the provided context, the specific details about the data collection methods used in the study are not provided. However, it can be inferred that the data used in this research is related to algal blooms and Chlorophyll concentrations in the Zhoushan fishery. Given that the study utilizes satellite data, it can be assumed that the data was collected through remote sensing satellites. Remote sensing is a popular method for monitoring and collecting data over large bodies of water, providing a non-invasive and cost-effective solution for gathering information on various oceanographic parameters.

Answer:::
In the study "Algal blooms forecasting with hybrid deep learning models from satellite data in the Zhoushan fishery," the raw data is collected using remote sensing satellites. The data is then processed and used as input for deep learning models, specifically a hybrid CNN-LSTM model, to forecast Chlorophyll concentrations and algal blooms in the Zhoushan fishery.
