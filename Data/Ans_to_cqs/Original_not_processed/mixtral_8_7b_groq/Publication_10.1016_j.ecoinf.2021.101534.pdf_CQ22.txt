Answer:::

The performance of the deep learning model for sound identification is evaluated using several metrics. These include the area under the ROC curve (AUC), average precision (AP) for each sound class, mean average precision (mAP), and macro-average AUC for the overall model. Additionally, precision, recall, and F1 score are also calculated for each class and plotted as ecological curves to examine class-specific performance and its changes with threshold scores. These metrics are calculated using the scikit-learn package.

The AP value for the northern boobook S-01 is 0.49, while for other classes, the AP values are between 0.76 and 0.96. The mAP for the case study is 0.83, which is relatively inconspicuous compared to previous CNN-based approaches. However, it's important to note that the test dataset used in this study is obtained from soundscape recordings, which are usually much noisier than focal recordings.

The deep learning model used for sound identification is YOLOv5s, which is trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 32 and an input image dimension of 640 × 640. Default data augmentation, including scaling, color space adjustments, and Mosaic augmentation, is used during the training process. The model training is performed on a workstation equipped with an Intel Xeon E5–2660 V4 CPU, DDR4 2400 ECC 16GB RAM, NVIDIA Titan RTX GPU, and WD black AN1500 4 TB NVMePCIe SSD.

In summary, the performance of the deep learning model for sound identification is evaluated using various metrics, including AUC, AP, mAP, and macro-average AUC, as well as precision, recall, and F1 score. The model used in this study is YOLOv5s, which is trained on a workstation using default data augmentation and noisy test datasets obtained from soundscape recordings.
