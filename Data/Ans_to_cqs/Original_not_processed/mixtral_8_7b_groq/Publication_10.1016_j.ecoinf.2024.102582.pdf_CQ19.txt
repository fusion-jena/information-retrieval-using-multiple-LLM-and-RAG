The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model for individual tree crown delineation in mangrove forests using very-high-resolution satellite imagery. The study by Lassalle et al., 2022, focuses on the methodology and application of deep learning techniques for mangrove forest analysis, but it does not specify the framework.
