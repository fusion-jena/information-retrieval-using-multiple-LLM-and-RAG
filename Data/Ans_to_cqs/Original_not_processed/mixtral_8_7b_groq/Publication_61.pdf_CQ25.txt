Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning model in the context provided is classification. Specifically, it is used for the classification of images, particularly in the field of plant recognition.

In the text, it is mentioned that deep learning models, and specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have shown better performance than other machine learning techniques for the task of image classification. This has led to their application in various fields such as object recognition, facial key-point detection, image captioning, and plant recognition.

In the area of plant recognition, deep learning models are used to classify plants into different species. For instance, one study mentioned in the text trained a CNN to classify three different legume species: white bean, red bean, and soybean. Another study used a CNN to classify cactus species in aerial images.

Additionally, deep learning models are also used for disease detection in plants. For example, one study mentioned in the text used CNNs to detect diseases affecting plants.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is image classification, specifically for the task of plant recognition and disease detection in plants.
