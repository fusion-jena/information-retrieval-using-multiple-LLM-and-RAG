Answer:::
The provided context does not give information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used to create the Lang10m high-resolution CHM of the Earth is available. The sources cited in the context discuss the methods and results of various studies related to the use of remote sensing data and machine learning techniques for forest structure and fuel classification, but they do not provide information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
