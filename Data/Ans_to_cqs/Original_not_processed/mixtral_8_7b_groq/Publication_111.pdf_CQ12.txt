Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Gated Recurrent Unit-Deep Neural Network (GRU-DNN). This model combines the GRU, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), with a regular neural network. The GRU layer is used to capture the temporal dependencies in the data, and it is preceded by an input layer and followed by a fully connected layer. The input layer receives the data, and the output layer produces the predicted values. The GRU-DNN model is used to predict the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH) for the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency dataset. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first use of a GRU model architecture for forecasting SST and SWH.
