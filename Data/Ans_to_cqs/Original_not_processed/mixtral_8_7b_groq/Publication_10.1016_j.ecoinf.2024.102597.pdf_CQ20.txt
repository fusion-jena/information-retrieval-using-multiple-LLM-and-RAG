The provided context does not mention the use of any deep learning models for estimating water quality parameters. Therefore, the context does not provide information on the hardware resources used for training deep learning models, such as GPUs or TPUs.

The context does discuss the use of machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost, for estimating water quality parameters. However, the context does not mention the use of deep learning models like neural networks.

Moreover, the context provides information on the training time and hyperparameter optimization of the machine learning models, but it does not mention any hardware resources used for training. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the query based on the provided context.

Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models or the hardware resources used for training them.
