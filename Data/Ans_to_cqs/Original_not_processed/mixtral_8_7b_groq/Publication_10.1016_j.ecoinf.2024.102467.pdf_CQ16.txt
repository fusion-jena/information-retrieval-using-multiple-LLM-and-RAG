Answer:::
In the given context, specific criteria for determining when training is complete are not mentioned. However, generally, training of machine learning models is considered complete when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, or when the model achieves satisfactory performance on the validation set. This is done to prevent overfitting of the model on the training data. The context does mention that the training time was reduced and the model is more suitable for deployment in agricultural embedded devices, but it does not provide information on the specific stopping criterion used for training.
