Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the methodology and performance of a specific deep learning pipeline for species distribution modeling, but it does not mention where the code for this pipeline can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query. It is possible that the code has not been made publicly available, or it may be hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. If you are interested in the code, I would recommend reaching out to the authors of the study for more information.
