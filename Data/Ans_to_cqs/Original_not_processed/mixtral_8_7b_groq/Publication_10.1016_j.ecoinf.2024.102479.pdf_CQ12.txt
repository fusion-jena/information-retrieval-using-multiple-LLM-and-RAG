Answer:

The provided context does not specify the use of a deep learning model from the given categories such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. The mentioned models are Random forest, Multivariate adaptive regression splines, Penalized regression, Support vector machine, Gradient boosting, Artificial neural network, and k-Nearest Neighbors. Among these, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is the only one that can be considered a deep learning model, but the text does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning techniques like CNN, RNN, or Transformers.
