The provided context discusses the use of IFTL (Incremental Feature Transfer Learning) for improving learning by restricting overconfidence during Transfer Learning (TL) using GRNN (General Regression Neural Network) and SVR (Support Vector Regression) as Transfer Update Rules (TUR). However, it does not directly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

However, the context does provide some insights into the measures that could be taken to ensure the generalizability of a machine learning model.

Firstly, the use of well-known benchmark datasets for evaluating the performance of machine learning algorithms is mentioned. These benchmark datasets are typically diverse and large enough to train and test machine learning models.

Secondly, the concept of Transfer Learning (TL) itself can help improve the generalizability of a model. TL involves training a model on one dataset (source domain) and then fine-tuning it on a related but different dataset (target domain). This can help the model learn features that are relevant to the target task and improve its performance on new, unseen data.

Thirdly, the context mentions the importance of having a diverse but related source and target domain for evaluating the performance of IFTL. This suggests that having a diverse dataset can help improve the generalizability of a model.

Lastly, the context does not explicitly mention the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, these techniques are commonly used in machine learning to ensure the generalizability of a model. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on one fold, and testing it on another fold. This process is repeated for all the folds, and the final performance of the model is averaged across all the folds. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into folds while preserving the class distribution in each fold. This can help ensure that each fold has a representative sample of each class, improving the generalizability of the model.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, it does provide some insights into the measures that could be taken, such as using diverse benchmark datasets, Transfer Learning, having a diverse source and target domain, and using cross-validation or stratified splitting.
