Answer:::
 The data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study by R.K. James et al. for ecological informatics can be found at <https://git.wur.nl/deep-learning-tools-for-marine-ecosystem-monitoring>. This repository includes the deep learning and post-processing scripts, the 2012 aerial imagery, and the data output used in the study. By providing open-access scripts that can be adapted to various ecosystems, the authors aim to stimulate the uptake of deep learning techniques in ecology and conservation, including challenging coastal environments.
