Based on the given context, there are no specific preprocessing steps mentioned for training a deep learning model. However, the study by Huang et al., 2019 uses high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning to monitor ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen. It can be inferred that the imagery data used in this study would have undergone some preprocessing steps before being used to train the deep learning model.

Generally, preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model with remote sensing imagery may include:

1. Image acquisition: The first step involves obtaining the image data from a reliable source. The context mentions the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery.

2. Geometric correction: This step involves correcting the geometric distortions present in the image data due to factors like satellite orientation and Earth's curvature.

3. Radiometric correction: This step aims to correct the variations in brightness and contrast caused by the sensor's characteristics and atmospheric conditions.

4. Image enhancement: This step may include techniques like normalization, scaling, and cleaning to improve the image quality and make it suitable for analysis. Normalization is a common preprocessing step that scales the pixel values to a common range, which helps the deep learning model to learn better. Scaling can be used to reduce the effect of large values in the dataset, and cleaning can help remove noise and unwanted features from the image.

5. Feature extraction: This step involves extracting meaningful features from the image data that can be used to train the deep learning model. The context mentions the use of a deep learning model, but it does not specify which features were extracted from the imagery data.

6. Data splitting: This step involves splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

In summary, while the given context does not provide specific preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model, it can be inferred that image acquisition, geometric correction, radiometric correction, image enhancement, feature extraction, data splitting are common preprocessing steps for training deep learning models with remote sensing imagery.
