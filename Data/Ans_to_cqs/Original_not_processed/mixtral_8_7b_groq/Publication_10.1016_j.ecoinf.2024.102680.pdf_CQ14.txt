Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization methods. The context mainly focuses on comparing the performance of various algorithms and detectors on the URPC 2020 dataset, and the evaluation metrics used to measure their effectiveness. It also discusses the improvement in performance achieved by the CSMB and LKSP modules in the UODN detector, but does not provide details about the optimization of hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
