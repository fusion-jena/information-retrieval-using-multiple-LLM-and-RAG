Based on the provided context, the study does not mention the use of deep learning methods in the land use and land cover (LULC) analysis of Kruger National Park (KNP). Instead, it describes a supervised learning workflow using Random Forest, a type of machine learning algorithm, to obtain the woody cover classification. Therefore, the context does not provide information on the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization.

However, it is worth noting that regularization methods are essential in deep learning models to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability. Dropout is a regularization technique used in deep learning models, particularly in neural networks, to prevent overfitting. It randomly drops out a proportion of neurons during training, which helps to break the co-adaptations between neurons and improves the model's ability to generalize.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is another regularization technique used in deep learning models. It adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the model's weights. This penalty term discourages large weights, which helps to reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention the use of deep learning methods or regularization techniques in the LULC analysis of KNP, regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization are crucial in deep learning models to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability.
