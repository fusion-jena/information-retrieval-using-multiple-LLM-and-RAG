The provided context discusses a study by Gavrilov et al. (2012) about song structure analysis in birds, and it includes a table showing the number of tracked vocalizations of each song structure as a proportion of the whole dataset. However, it does not provide information about preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Answer:::

The provided context does not include information on the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. These steps are crucial in preparing the data for deep learning models to ensure better performance and convergence during training.

Normalization is the process of scaling numeric data to a common range, often between 0 and 1. This helps deep learning models avoid features with widely different scales, which could dominate the learning process.

Scaling is similar to normalization but involves resizing the data to specific values. This is useful when different features have different units, and it is essential to maintain the relative differences between them.

Cleaning refers to handling missing or corrupted data points in the dataset. This could involve removing, imputing, or interpolating the missing values to ensure the quality of the data used for training.

In summary, based on the provided context, there is no information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. Normalization, scaling, and cleaning are common preprocessing steps that help prepare data for deep learning models.
