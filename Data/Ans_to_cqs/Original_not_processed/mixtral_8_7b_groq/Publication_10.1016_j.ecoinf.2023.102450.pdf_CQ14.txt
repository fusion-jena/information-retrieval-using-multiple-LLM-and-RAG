Answer:::
I cannot provide a specific answer to how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized in the given context because the sources do not provide information on this topic.

The context includes several research papers and a table of values, but none of them mention the method used for hyperparameter optimization. Hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in machine learning model development, and various methods such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and gradient-based optimization can be used. However, without explicit information, it is not possible to determine which method was used in this case.

For instance, the first source (Yin et al., 2024) presents a study on stereotypic behavior and physiological stress among captive jungle cats in India. Although the paper discusses the use of a model for tracking cat movements, it does not mention the hyperparameter optimization method. Similarly, the second source (McCullough & Goodhill, 2021) focuses on unsupervised quantification of naturalistic animal behaviors, but it does not provide details about the optimization of hyperparameters. The third source (Morita et al., 2021) examines the effects of short-term isolation on social animals' behavior, but it does not involve machine learning model development or hyperparameter optimization.

In summary, I cannot determine how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized based on the provided context since none of the sources mention the optimization method.
