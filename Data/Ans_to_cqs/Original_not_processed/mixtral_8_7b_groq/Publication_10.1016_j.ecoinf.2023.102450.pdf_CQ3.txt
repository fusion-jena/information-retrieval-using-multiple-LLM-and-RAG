Answer:::

The pieces of context provided do not directly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do discuss the use of deep learning in animal identification and tracking, which implies the use of some form of data annotation.

In the context of Clune (2018), the deep learning pipeline likely involves annotating camera-trap images with labels indicating the presence and species of wild animals. The system described in the paper is able to automatically identify, count, and describe wild animals in camera-trap images, which suggests that the images have been annotated with the necessary information for the deep learning model to learn from.

In the context of Okafor et al. (2016), the deep learning pipeline involves recognizing wild animals in images. The authors compare the performance of deep learning to bag of visual words for wild-animal recognition, which implies that the images used in the study have been annotated with labels indicating the presence and species of wild animals.

In the context of Schindler and Steinhage (2021), the deep learning pipeline involves training a Siamese network for animal tracking. The network is trained using a few-shot learning method, where the training set contains N different categories with each category comprising K labeled samples. This suggests that the images used in the study have been annotated with labels indicating the presence and category of animals, as well as their location within the image.

Based on these contexts, it can be inferred that data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation are likely used in the deep learning pipeline for animal identification and tracking. Bounding box annotation involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image, while instance segmentation involves separating the object from the background and other objects in the image. These techniques allow the deep learning model to learn the necessary features to identify and track the animals of interest.
