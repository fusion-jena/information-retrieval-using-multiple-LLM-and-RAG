Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of images in the deep learning pipeline, specifically in the context of training and comparing the performance of different image classification models such as CLIP, ResNet-50, Inception-V3, and ViT. These models are trained on images that have been resized and preprocessed to fit the specific input requirements of each model.

For CLIP, the model is trained on 400 million images from the web along with their captions. The images are used as input to the image encoder, which maps them to a vector that represents a robust semantic feature representation of the image.

ResNet-50, Inception-V3, and ViT also use images as input, with ResNet-50 and ViT requiring images to be resized to (224, 224) pixels and Inception-V3 requiring images to be resized to (299, 299) pixels.

In addition to images, the context also mentions the use of CSV files in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the context mentions that dataset imbalance was dealt with by including class weights in the cross-entropy loss function, which suggests that the class weights were stored in a CSV file.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline uses images and CSV files as data formats. However, the context does not mention the use of audio or video data formats.
