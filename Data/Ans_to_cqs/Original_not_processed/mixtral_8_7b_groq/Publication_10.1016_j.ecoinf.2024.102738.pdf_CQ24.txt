The provided context does not contain information about deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness such as the use of a random seed value. The context focuses on the use of Random Forest classification algorithm for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping in the Amazon forest, and the creation of LULC maps with 30-meter pixels using training points collected in the field and various combinations of spectral bands, vegetation and soil indices, and water indices. The classifier's performance was evaluated in different morphoclimatic conditions.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query regarding strategies employed to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines.
