Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include average precision (AP), AP50, and AP75. The average precision (AP) is calculated over intersection over union (IoU) thresholds from 50% to 95% in 5% increments. AP50 and AP75 denote the average precision at an IoU threshold of 50% and 75%, respectively. These metrics are used to quantify the results of D-Mask R-CNN, which is a modified version of Mask R-CNN, for detecting and segmenting instances of deer in an RGB-D dataset. Additionally, a standard deep learning classifier (ResNet-50 pre-trained on ImageNet) achieved an average accuracy of 89.00% on an held-out test set for classifying moths. However, the context does not mention other metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score for evaluating the performance of the models.
