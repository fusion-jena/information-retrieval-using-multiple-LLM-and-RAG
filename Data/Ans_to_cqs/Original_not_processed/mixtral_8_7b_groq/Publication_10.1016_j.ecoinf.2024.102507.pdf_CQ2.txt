Answer: Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline utilizes image data formats as input. Specifically, the image data is in the form of bands, which are disassembled into single-band images using Python's Rasterio module. This process reduces the dimensionality of the input data, making it more manageable for the deep learning model. The study mentioned in the context focuses on comparing the performance of the deep learning model using different numbers of bands, such as 8, 36, and 72 bands. However, there is no mention of other data formats like audio, video, or CSV being used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline in this study uses image data in the form of bands.
