Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the continuous assessment of the model accuracy using the validation set. This approach is used to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and is able to generalize well to unseen data. The learning curves of the five networks, as shown in Figure 6, are used to monitor the model performance during training. The learning curves indicate a reduction in training losses as the number of epochs increases, with the ResNet architecture, particularly ResNet50 and ResNet101, outperforming the other networks. The ResNet50 network converges by around 150 epochs, while Inceptionv3 converges by approximately 400 epochs.

In addition, the performance of the testing set is used to guide the final decision on model selection. This approach ensures that the selected model is able to perform well not only on the training and validation sets but also on a completely new set of data.

Furthermore, the dataset was randomly divided into three parts, namely the training, validation, and testing sets, in a stratified manner to maintain class proportions across all parts. This division was performed to ensure that the model is trained, validated, and tested on a diverse set of data, further enhancing the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.

Overall, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves continuous assessment of the model accuracy using the validation set, monitoring the learning curves, and using the performance of the testing set to guide the final decision on model selection. These strategies ensure that the selected model is able to perform well on both the training and validation sets, as well as on a completely new set of data.
