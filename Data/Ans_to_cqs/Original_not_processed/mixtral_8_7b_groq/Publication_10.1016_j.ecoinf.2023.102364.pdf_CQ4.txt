Based on the provided context, there is no information about the use of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the deep learning pipeline. The text describes a study that used an ensemble of machine learning models to predict Short-billed Gull (Larus canus) abundance hotspots and coldspots. The models were trained on a combination of a 2014-2015 Short-billed Gull presence/absence data cube and 68 open-access predictor layers, including socio-economic US Census data. However, the context does not mention any data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Answer::: 
(Answer: The provided context does not include information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.)
