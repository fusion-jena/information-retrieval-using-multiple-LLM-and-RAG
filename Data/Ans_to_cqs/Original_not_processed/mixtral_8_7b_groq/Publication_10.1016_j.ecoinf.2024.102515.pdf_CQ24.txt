The provided context does not contain information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. The context focuses on the use of the Twitter API and the 'Full-archive search endpoint' to access the entire dataset published on Twitter, as well as the use of the twarc2 library to handle the data in JSON format returned by the Twitter API. The methodology used in the DIVERSIMAR project to understand how users expressed themselves on this social network and the limitations of this methodology are also discussed. However, there is no mention of deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in such a pipeline.
