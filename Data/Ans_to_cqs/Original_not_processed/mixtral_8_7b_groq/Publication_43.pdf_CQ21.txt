Answer:::

After training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for Ziziphus lotus shrub detection, several postprocessing steps can be involved. These steps typically include the calculation of various metrics, generating saliency maps, and creating a confusion matrix. However, based on the provided context, only the metrics calculation step is explicitly mentioned.

In the context, the training dataset consists of 100 image patches of Ziziphus lotus shrubs and 100 image patches of bare soil with sparse vegetation. These images are divided into 80 images for training and 20 images for validation for both the CNN and Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) classifiers. The performance of the CNN classifier is evaluated using training accuracy in the training-zone, and testing accuracy in test-zone-1 and test-zone-2. Although not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that metrics such as overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated for the CNN classifier's performance assessment.

Saliency maps, which highlight the important regions in the input images that contribute to the model's decision-making process, are not explicitly mentioned in the context. Generating saliency maps can be helpful in understanding the model's behavior and identifying potential biases or weaknesses.

A confusion matrix, which is a table used to describe the performance of a classification model, is also not explicitly mentioned in the context. A confusion matrix would provide more detailed information about the types of errors the CNN classifier is making, such as false positives and false negatives. This information can be used to further refine and improve the model's performance.

In summary, while the provided context mentions the calculation of metrics for the CNN classifier's performance assessment, it does not explicitly mention the generation of saliency maps or a confusion matrix. These additional postprocessing steps can provide valuable insights into the model's behavior and performance, and may be worth considering in future work.
