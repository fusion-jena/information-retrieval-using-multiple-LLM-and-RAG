Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline is used for automating the classification of camera trap images in ecology. Therefore, the data format used in this pipeline is primarily images.

The context mentions that artificial intelligence, specifically deep neural networks, is used to classify camera trap images. Camera traps are devices that capture images or videos of wildlife in their natural habitats. These images or videos can then be analyzed to monitor biodiversity, animal behavior, and other ecological phenomena.

The context also provides a table listing the number of training, validation, and test images for different classes, including "Bad quality," "Bird," "Empty," "Least weasel," "Lemming," "Shrew," "Stoat," "Vole," and "TOTAL." This table indicates that the data used in this deep learning pipeline consists of image files.

There is no mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV in the provided context. Therefore, it can be concluded that the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images.
