Answer:::

The provided context does not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of a deep learning algorithm for early diagnosis of COVID-19 in Castillo, O., 2020. Deep learning algorithms often incorporate randomness in their training process, and setting a fixed random seed value is a common strategy to ensure reproducibility of results.

Additionally, the Duszy´nski, J., Afelt, A., Ochab-Marcinek, A., Owczuk, R., Pyr´c, K., Rosinska, A., Rychard, T., 2020. report mentions the use of the Maximum Entropy-Ecological Niche Model (ME-ENM) for identifying geographical areas with a high infection rate of COVID-19. ME-ENM is a machine learning model that can handle large and complex datasets, such as the Big Data type environmental and air pollution data mentioned in the context. ME-ENM, like other machine learning models, may incorporate randomness in its training process, and setting a fixed random seed value could be a strategy to ensure reproducibility.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is mentioned that a deep learning algorithm and a machine learning model are used in the analysis of COVID-19 data. In deep learning and machine learning, setting a fixed random seed value is a common strategy to ensure reproducibility of results.
