The provided context does not contain specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that Zhong, L., Hu, L., and Zhou, H. (2019) used a deep learning-based multi-temporal crop classification method in their study. Deep learning models typically require substantial computational resources, and training such models is often done on specialized hardware like GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) or TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). These hardware resources can significantly speed up the training process due to their ability to perform parallel computations. However, the specific hardware used by Zhong, L., Hu, L., and Zhou, H. (2019) or any other authors in the provided context is not mentioned. Therefore, it is not possible to give a definitive answer to this query based on the given information.
