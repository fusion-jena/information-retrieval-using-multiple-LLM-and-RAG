Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a specific deep learning model. However, some related concepts can be inferred from the texts.

Firstly, Kumar and Gorai (2023) performed a comparative evaluation of deep convolutional neural network and deep neural network-based land use/land cover classifications using fused multi-sensor satellite data. Although the text does not explicitly mention the techniques used to ensure generalizability, it can be inferred that the use of multi-sensor data might contribute to the model's generalizability, as it provides a more diverse dataset.

Secondly, Li et al. (2023a) discussed the scale effect of land cover classification from remote sensing data. They considered varying pixel sizes of water bodies at different resolutions and adjusted the features with additional data sources, including assessments of water quality and land cover information. This approach can be seen as a way to increase the robustness and generalizability of the classification model, as it takes into account various factors that might affect the classification results.

In addition, the study by Kravitz et al. (2020) on chlorophyll-a retrieval over small inland water targets using Sentinel 3 OLCI data implies that the authors might have used some form of cross-validation or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of their model. These techniques are commonly used in remote sensing and machine learning to assess the model's performance on unseen data and prevent overfitting.

Lastly, Lafon et al. (2018) developed an atmospheric correction and multi-conditional algorithm for multi-sensor remote sensing of suspended particulate matter in coastal waters. Although not directly related to deep learning models, their work on multi-sensor data and atmospheric correction can contribute to the generalizability of remote sensing models, as it helps to reduce the influence of external factors on the data.

In conclusion, while there is no explicit information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model in the provided context, some related concepts can be inferred. These include the use of diverse datasets, such as multi-sensor data, adjusting features with additional data sources, and techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
