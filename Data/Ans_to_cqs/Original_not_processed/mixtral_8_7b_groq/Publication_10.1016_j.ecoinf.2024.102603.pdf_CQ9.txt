I'm sorry for any confusion, but the context provided does not include information about the data repository for a specific deep learning pipeline. The text mainly discusses the differences between deep learning and XGBoost models, as well as the use of satellite data for chlorophyll fluorescence retrieval. Therefore, I cannot accurately answer the query regarding the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
