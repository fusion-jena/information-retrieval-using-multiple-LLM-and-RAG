Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, the context does provide some details about the computational time of the model training process under different covariate selection procedures.

The study compares three main covariate selection procedures: "embedded," "filter," and "random." The computational time for running the overall covariate selection procedure and model fitting steps under each of these procedures is presented in Figure 4(A). Additionally, the computational time for model fitting only under each of the three main covariate selection procedures and by modelling algorithm (GLM, GAM, and RF) is presented in Figure 4(B).

The study also mentions that the overall average computation time for running both the covariate selection procedure and model fitting steps was higher with the embedded procedure compared to the two alternatives, but models from the embedded procedure were faster to fit. This suggests that the embedded procedure may have a longer preprocessing time for covariate selection but a faster model fitting time.

In summary, while the provided context does not give explicit information about postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, it does provide details about the computational time of the model training process under different covariate selection procedures.
