Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of two metrics: Frames Per Second (FPS) and memory usage. The FPS measures the execution speed of the tracking algorithm, while memory usage evaluates the convenience of the model deployment. These metrics are calculated using methodologies provided in the Supplementary Material. The FPS and memory usage are used to assess the performance of the C1 module, which optimizes detection accuracy and inference speed. The C1 module's complexity and accuracy are visualized in a histogram and chart, respectively, as shown in Figure 3.

Furthermore, the training process is carried out on a Windows 10-based mobile laptop equipped with an Intel(R) i7-11800H CPU, a GeForce RTX3080 GPU with 16GB of video memory, and the PyCharm software platform. Python 3.8 and the Pytorch 1.9 deep learning framework are used for training purposes. The specific environmental configurations and model training parameters are listed in Table 1.

During the training, detection thresholds of IoU = 0.3 and score = 0.3 are established to enhance detection accuracy. These thresholds indicate that a bounding box with a likelihood of containing a fish of 30% or higher is considered valid and retained.

Therefore, the strategy to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of FPS and memory usage metrics, visualization of the C1 module's complexity and accuracy, and the establishment of detection thresholds.
