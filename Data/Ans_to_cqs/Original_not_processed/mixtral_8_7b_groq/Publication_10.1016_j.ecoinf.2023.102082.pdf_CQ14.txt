Based on the provided context, there is no information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the use of various heterogeneity indices, such as Rao’s Q, Shannon’s H, and Simpson’s D, to analyze and estimate forest variables using LiDAR data. However, it does not mention any specific methods for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
