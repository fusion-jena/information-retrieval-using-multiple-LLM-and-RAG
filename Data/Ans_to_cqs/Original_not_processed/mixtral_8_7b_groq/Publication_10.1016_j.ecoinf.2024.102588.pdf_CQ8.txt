Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The sources mentioned in the context are research papers and articles that discuss the potential of deep learning techniques for estimating aquatic ecosystem health indices. However, they do not provide any code repository links for the implemented deep learning models.

It is common for researchers to share their code repositories on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket to promote transparency and reproducibility of their research. However, in this case, the authors have not provided a code repository link within the given context.

If you are interested in implementing a similar deep learning pipeline for estimating aquatic ecosystem health indices, you can refer to the methods and techniques discussed in the papers. You may also consider reaching out to the authors directly to inquire about the code repository.
