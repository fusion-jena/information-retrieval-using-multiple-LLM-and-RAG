The context provided does not give information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the methodology and data used in a study, including the use of five network models, ResNet50 and ResNet101 being the top performers. The models were evaluated using validation and test sets, and the learning curves were monitored to ensure convergence. The study also provides information about the datasets used, their sources, and their resolutions, but it does not mention the platform used for deployment.
