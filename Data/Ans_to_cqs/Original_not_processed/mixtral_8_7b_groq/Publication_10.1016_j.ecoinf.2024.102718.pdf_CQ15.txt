Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific details about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning models mentioned, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. However, it does discuss a new deep learning model called BEiT that outperforms other state-of-the-art models in a classification task.

In the context, the authors mention an ablation study (Table 11) evaluating the BEiT model's performance without added noise. The table shows the accuracy, loss, AUC, and other evaluation metrics for the BEiT model. However, it does not specify the optimization techniques employed during the training of the model.

In the description of the research reproducibility for their proposed model (M), the authors mention the model's architecture and compilation parameters. Still, they do not explicitly mention any optimization techniques.

Moreover, the context highlights the advantages of deep learning in agricultural settings, such as managing extensive datasets and improving accuracy and robustness. But it does not delve into the specific optimization techniques used in these deep learning models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer this question without additional information.
