The provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the DeepLabV3+ algorithm, which is a semantic segmentation algorithm used for image analysis. Semantic segmentation is a type of data annotation where each pixel in an image is labeled with a class category.

In the context, it is mentioned that the DeepLabV3+ algorithm is used for land cover classification, where the algorithm predicts the classification results in TIF format and the segmentation results are obtained from MRS in SHP format. The algorithm then integrates these results using Python programming language.

Furthermore, the context mentions that during the training process of the DeepLabV3+ model, large-size images are cut into regular image blocks for input. This is a type of data preprocessing technique that is often used in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, it does discuss semantic segmentation, which is a type of data annotation technique. Additionally, the context mentions data preprocessing techniques that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines.
