Answer:::

The provided context discusses a data analysis of baleen whale vocalizations, but it does not directly mention the methods used for collecting the raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does give some indirect clues about the possible data collection methods.

The data analyzed in the study seems to be related to baleen whale songs, as it includes the number of tracked vocalizations of each song structure. This suggests that acoustic methods were used to collect the raw data. Acoustic monitoring is a common method for studying baleen whales, as it allows researchers to track and analyze their vocalizations over time and across different locations.

The study also mentions the need for a holistic approach to baseline and monitoring surveys, which implies that a combination of data collection methods was used. Surveys could include both visual and acoustic monitoring, as well as other methods such as environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling or satellite tracking.

However, the context does not provide enough information to confirm whether public datasets or sensors were used for data collection. It is possible that the data was collected through a combination of these methods, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided text.

In summary, while the provided context suggests that acoustic monitoring was used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it does not provide enough information to confirm whether surveys, sensors, or public datasets were also used. Further information would be needed to answer this question fully.
