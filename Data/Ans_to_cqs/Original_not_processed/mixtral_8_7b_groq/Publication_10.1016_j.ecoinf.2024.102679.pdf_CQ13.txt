Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of a deep learning model for wildlife population estimation in the African savanna, but it does not give specific details about the hyperparameters used, such as the learning rate or optimizer.

The text does mention that the model underwent fine-tuning for four iterations, and that the training procedure for the first two iterations consisted of two main steps: training the architecture using positive patches for 200 epochs, and then collecting and including hard negative patches to further train the model for 50 epochs. During the last two fine-tuning iterations, only the second step of the training procedure was used. However, the specific hyperparameters used in these training steps are not provided.

In addition, the context mentions that during inference, the patch size was set to 1024 Ã— 1,024 pixels to accelerate the process. This information is related to the model's inference process rather than its hyperparameters.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
