Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study likely used image-level annotation, where each image is labeled with a specific plant trait or multiple traits. This is suggested by the description of using the iNaturalist database, which provides a worldwide record of millions of plant photographs including taxa and geolocations.

Annotation at the image level is a common approach in deep learning for computer vision tasks, especially when dealing with large-scale datasets. It is less resource-intensive than techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation, which require precise delineation of objects within an image. Image-level annotation is sufficient when the goal is to classify or regress the entire image to a specific label or value, as in the case of this study, where the aim is to predict plant traits based on images and bioclimatic data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used, it suggests that the study employed image-level annotation for their deep learning pipeline.
