Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of Bayesian optimization for tuning hyperparameters of species-specific models, but it does not specify the use of deep learning models. Instead, it refers to the use of the R package "ranger," which is a implementation of random forests, a type of machine learning algorithm but not deep learning.

In the context of deep learning, common hyperparameters that are often tuned include the learning rate, the type of optimizer, the number of layers and units in the model, and regularization parameters. The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. The optimizer is the algorithm used to update the weights in the model, such as stochastic gradient descent or Adam. The number of layers and units in the model determine the complexity of the model. Regularization parameters, such as L1 and L2 regularization, are used to prevent overfitting.

However, the provided context does not mention any of these hyperparameters, so it is not possible to answer this question without additional information.

It is important to note that hyperparameter tuning is a crucial step in building a deep learning model, as it can greatly impact the performance of the model. Techniques such as grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization can be used to find the optimal set of hyperparameters.

In summary, the provided context does not mention the use of deep learning models or any of the typical deep learning hyperparameters. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question without additional information.
