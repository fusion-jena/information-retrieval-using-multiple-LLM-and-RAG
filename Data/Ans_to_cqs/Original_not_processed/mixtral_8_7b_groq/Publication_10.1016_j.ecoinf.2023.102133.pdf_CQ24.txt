Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, the text does discuss the use of randomness in the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, which is a type of ensemble learning and not deep learning.

In the RF algorithm, randomness is introduced in two ways: first, by selecting a random subset of features at each candidate split during the learning process, and second, by constructing and training each decision tree within the RF on a random subset of the data in the training set. These strategies aim to increase diversity among the trees and decrease their correlation, improving the overall performance of the RF model.

In contrast, deep learning models typically use a fixed seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. While some randomness can be introduced during the training process, such as through the use of dropout regularization or data augmentation, these techniques are used to prevent overfitting and improve generalization, rather than to increase diversity among models.

Therefore, the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline are different from those used in the RF algorithm. In deep learning, a fixed seed value is typically used to ensure reproducibility, while techniques such as dropout regularization and data augmentation are used to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
