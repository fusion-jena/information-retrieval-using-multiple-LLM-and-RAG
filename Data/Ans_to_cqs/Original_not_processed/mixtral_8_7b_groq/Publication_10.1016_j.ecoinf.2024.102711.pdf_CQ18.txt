The strategy implemented to monitor the model's performance during training involves the use of Out-Of-Fold (OOF) predictions and stacking of models. In this approach, the development dataset is divided into k groups using k-fold cross-validation. During each iteration, one group is used as the tuning dataset, and the remaining k-1 groups are used as the training dataset. The model is trained on the training dataset, and its performance is evaluated on the tuning dataset. The predictions made on the tuning dataset are referred to as OOF predictions. This process is repeated for all k groups, and the OOF predictions for all iterations are averaged to reduce variance.

The averaged OOF predictions are then used as features to train a second layer of models. This process of creating multiple layers of models is called stacking. The idea behind stacking is to combine the predictions of multiple models to improve the overall performance. The OOF predictions from the first layer of models are used as input features to train the second layer of models. This process can be repeated for L stacking layers to create a powerful ensemble model.

Moreover, the strategy also includes evaluating the model performance against an independent dataset to reveal the true model fit and behavior. This step is crucial to identify overfitting issues, where the model captures not only the trend but also the noise in the data. In the study, the model evaluation against an independent dataset revealed a true model fit that was 10% lower than that obtained against the model development dataset in the best performing models and about 30% lower in the worst performing ones.

In summary, the strategy to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of Out-Of-Fold predictions, stacking of models, and evaluating the model performance against an independent dataset. This approach helps to identify overfitting issues, reduce variance, and improve the overall performance of the model.
