Answer:::

The text does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting the raw data. However, it can be inferred that the data consists of plant species observations, which have been accumulated through citizen programs in biodiversity sciences. These programs likely involve surveys or similar data collection methods, where citizens contribute observations of plant species. The text also mentions the use of geolocation data, which suggests that the observations include information about the location where each plant species was found.

Additionally, the text mentions the use of environmental data, which includes variables such as land cover, altitude, and temperature. These environmental data are likely obtained from public datasets, such as those provided by government agencies or scientific organizations.

In summary, while the text does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting the raw data, it can be inferred that the data includes plant species observations contributed by citizens through biodiversity science programs, as well as environmental data obtained from public datasets.
