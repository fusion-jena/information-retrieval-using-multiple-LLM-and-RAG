Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Regularization techniques like dropout, L1/L2 regularization, data augmentation, and early stopping are commonly used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 during training, preventing over-reliance on individual units. L1/L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights and promotes generalization. Data augmentation generates new training examples by applying transformations to the existing data, increasing the model's robustness. Early stopping halts training when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving, preventing the model from learning spurious patterns in the training data. Without explicit information in the context, it is not possible to determine which of these methods were used in this particular deep learning pipeline.
