Answer:::

The data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the CityNet project by Fairbrass et al. (2019) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided article or the supporting information. The article does mention that the dataset used was randomly selected from a larger set of urban audio recordings, but it does not provide information on where this dataset can be accessed.

However, the article does cite several sources that could potentially be useful in locating similar datasets. For example, Salamon et al. (2014) provide a dataset and taxonomy for urban sound research, while Lin et al. (2017) describe a method for improving biodiversity assessment through unsupervised separation of biological sounds from long-duration recordings.

Moreover, there are several data repositories that are commonly used in the field of ecology and environmental sciences, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF. It is possible that the dataset used in the CityNet project is available on one of these platforms, but further investigation would be needed to confirm this.

In summary, while the specific data repository for the CityNet project is not provided in the given article, there are several potential sources of similar datasets and data repositories that could be explored.
