Answer:::

The provided context does not directly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of the Lasso model, which is a type of linear regression that incorporates L1 regularization.

Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is a regression analysis method that performs both variable selection and regularization to improve the prediction accuracy and interpretability of the statistical model. It works by adding an L1 penalty term to the loss function, which results in shrinking some coefficients to zero. This leads to a sparse model with fewer parameters, which can help to reduce overfitting.

In addition to Lasso, there are other regularization methods commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, such as dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out (i.e., sets to zero) a proportion of the neurons in a layer during training. This helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons and promoting the learning of more robust features. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages smaller weight values, which can help to reduce overfitting by preventing the model from fitting too closely to the training data.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention dropout or L2 regularization, it does discuss the use of Lasso, which is another regularization method commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting.
