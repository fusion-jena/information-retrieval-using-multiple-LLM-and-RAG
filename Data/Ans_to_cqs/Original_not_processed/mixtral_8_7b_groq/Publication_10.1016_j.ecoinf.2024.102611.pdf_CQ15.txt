Answer:::

The pieces of context provided do mention some techniques used in the development of deep learning models for plant species identification, although they do not explicitly state the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipelines. However, we can infer some optimization techniques based on the related works cited.

In the study by Azadnia et al. (2022), they developed a deep learning model for medicinal plant identification using a deep convolutional neural network based on global average pooling. Although they do not mention the optimization technique used, it is common to use some form of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or adaptive moment estimation (Adam) for training deep learning models.

The study by Bambil et al. (2020) used machine learning and artificial neural networks for plant species identification, but they do not mention the optimization technique used.

Barhate et al. (2023) used a hyperparameter-tuned batch-updated stochastic gradient descent technique for plant species identification using hybrid deep learning. This indicates that they used a form of SGD as an optimization technique.

Barr√© et al. (2017) used a deep learning model called Leafnet, which achieved an accuracy of 86.3% towards the top five classes on the Leafsnap dataset. However, they do not mention the optimization technique used.

Ganguly et al. (2022) utilized the ResNet-50 architecture to capture leaf feature patterns via fusion learning and trained the model on three benchmark datasets. They do not mention the optimization technique used.

Tiwari et al. (2021) proposed a multi-layered convolutional network for multi-class disease classification in plants and obtained about 99.09% accuracy. However, they do not mention the optimization technique used.

Based on the related works cited, it can be inferred that optimization techniques such as SGD and Adam are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for plant species identification. However, the pieces of context provided do not explicitly state the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipelines for plant species identification.
