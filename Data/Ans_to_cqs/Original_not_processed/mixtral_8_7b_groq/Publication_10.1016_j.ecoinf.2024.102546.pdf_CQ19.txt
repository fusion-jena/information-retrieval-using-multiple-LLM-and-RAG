Answer:::
The specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models in the provided papers are not explicitly mentioned. However, based on the common practice and compatibility with the mentioned augmentation techniques and model architectures, it can be inferred that popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch are likely to have been used.

For instance, the "jitter and mosaic" augmentations were applied to the weed images, and these techniques are commonly implemented using libraries built on top of TensorFlow or PyTorch. Similarly, the "random crop and scale" augmentation is typically carried out using these frameworks.

Moreover, the models were trained with batch sizes of 8 for 40 epochs, which is compatible with both TensorFlow and PyTorch. The resizing of images to 800 Ã— 800 pixels, maintaining the original aspect ratio, is also a standard preprocessing step in both frameworks.

Therefore, while the specific deep learning frameworks are not explicitly stated, it can be reasonably assumed that either TensorFlow or PyTorch was used for building the deep learning models in the provided papers.
