Answer:::
The deep learning model in this study was trained using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Specifically, the Keras implementation of the CNN was run on Nvidia P100 accelerator cards, which have 12 GB of GPU memory each. The computation was performed using CUDA version 9.1 and CuDNN, which are software libraries developed by Nvidia to maximize the performance of GPU computing for deep learning tasks.
