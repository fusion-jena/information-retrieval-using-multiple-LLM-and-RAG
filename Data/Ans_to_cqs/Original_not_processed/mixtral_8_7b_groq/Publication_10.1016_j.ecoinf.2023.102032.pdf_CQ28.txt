The specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model for calculating Wetland Use Intensity (WUI) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the new method for calculating WUI is fully automated in the cloud-based GEE (Google Earth Engine) processing environment. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was likely deployed on the Google Cloud Platform, which is the platform that GEE operates on.
