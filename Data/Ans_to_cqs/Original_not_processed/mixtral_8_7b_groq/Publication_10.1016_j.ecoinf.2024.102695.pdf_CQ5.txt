Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the research focuses on the long-term prediction of multivariate marine chemical data, specifically dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in the Shandong peninsula. Therefore, it can be inferred that the dataset used in this study is related to marine chemical data, and more specifically, to DO concentrations in the Shandong peninsula.

The context also provides details about the data splitting strategy used in the study, where the dataset is divided chronologically into training, validation, and test sets, which suggests that the dataset used in this study is time-series data.

Moreover, the study uses a deep learning model that involves attention mechanisms, specifically multiscale attention, to capture features at different time scales. This indicates that the dataset used in this study likely has a temporal component, and the model is designed to capture patterns and correlations in the data over time.

In summary, while the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that the dataset is related to marine chemical data, specifically DO concentrations in the Shandong peninsula, and is a time-series dataset. The deep learning model used in the study involves attention mechanisms designed to capture patterns and correlations in the data over time.
