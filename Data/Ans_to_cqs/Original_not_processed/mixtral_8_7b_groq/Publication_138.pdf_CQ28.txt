Answer:

The context provided does not give information about the specific platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model. The focus of the given text is on the description and comparison of various deep learning architectures such as LeNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG-19, and ResNet, as well as the introduction of a new network called ICSNet.

The authors do mention that they conducted experiments and reported the accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC, min-batch size, and time for each of the algorithms compared. However, there is no mention of the platform used for deploying these models. It is possible that the models were trained and tested using local resources or a combination of cloud-based and local resources.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the specific platform used for deploying the deep learning model.
