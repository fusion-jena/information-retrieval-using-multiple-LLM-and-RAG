Based on the provided context, there is no specific mention of any standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, the text describes a study that uses a trial-and-error method to determine the appropriate number of neurons and learning rate for an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.

The dataset used in this study appears to be related to predicting the impact of climate change on aquatic insect species richness in running waters. The data was split randomly into two sets, with 80% used for model training and 20% for model testing. The training process involved updating the network parameters, such as weights and biases, based on the computed gradient. The training process was stopped when the network began to overfit the data, i.e., the error on the validation set increased.

Therefore, while the study does use a deep learning approach by employing an ANN model, it does not use any of the standard deep learning datasets commonly referred to in the field.
