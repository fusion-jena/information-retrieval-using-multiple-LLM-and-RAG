Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of Random Forest (RF) for land cover classification and does not mention any deep learning pipeline or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning. However, I can provide some general information about regularization methods used in deep learning.

Regularization methods are used in deep learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. This penalty term discourages the learning of overly complex models that may not generalize well to unseen data.

One common regularization method used in deep learning is L2 regularization, which adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the model weights. This encourages the learning of smaller weights, which can reduce the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting.

Another regularization method used in deep learning is dropout, which randomly sets a fraction of the model's activations to zero during training. This prevents the co-adaptation of neurons and encourages the learning of more robust features that can generalize well to unseen data.

In addition to L2 regularization and dropout, there are other regularization methods used in deep learning, such as L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation. The choice of regularization method depends on the specific deep learning pipeline and the nature of the data being used.

Therefore, while the provided context does not mention any specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline for land cover classification, L2 regularization and dropout are two common regularization methods used in deep learning to prevent overfitting.
