Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the generalizability of the deep learning model, specifically the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, was addressed using k-fold cross-validation. 

Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a machine learning model and tune its hyperparameters. It involves dividing the dataset into 'k' subsets or folds. The model is trained on 'k-1' folds while one fold is held back for testing. This process is repeated 'k' times, each time with a different fold used for testing. The performance of the model is then averaged over the 'k' runs. 

In the context provided, the authors used cross-validation to choose the values of 'cluster' and 'Î±' for their LSTM model. These parameters are related to the Pattern-Based Prediction (PBP) framework, which is built on top of the LSTM model. The PBP framework involves clustering the data into different patterns, identifying a base pattern, and computing an association coefficient 'd*' to predict future events. 

However, the context does not mention other measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as using a diverse dataset, stratified splitting, or other data augmentation techniques. Therefore, while cross-validation was used to tune the model's hyperparameters and assess its performance, other potential strategies to improve generalizability were not explicitly mentioned.
