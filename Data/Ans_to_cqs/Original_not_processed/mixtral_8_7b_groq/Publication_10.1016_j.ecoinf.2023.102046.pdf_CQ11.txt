Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various convolutional neural network models, few-shot learning, and a text and image encoder called CLIP, but it does not mention any data repository or link associated with these models or techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
