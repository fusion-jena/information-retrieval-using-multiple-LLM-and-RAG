Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline for automated fish grading is not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the input data is likely in the form of images, since the process of fish freshness evaluation involves observing the eyes, gills, and other physical attributes of the fish.

In the study by Jayasundara, J.M.V.D.B. et al., they developed a deep learning model for automated fish grading. The study mentions that the fish images were preprocessed and normalized, but it does not provide specific details about the format of the input data. Similarly, the study by Kunjulakshmi, S. et al. developed a portable, non-destructive freshness indicative sensor for Indian Mackerel, but it does not mention the format of the data used in their study.

Furthermore, the study by Lalabadi, H.M. et al. categorized fish freshness based on color features of the eyes and gills, which suggests that the input data is likely in the form of images. Similarly, the study by Mokrani, D. et al. investigated the effect of fish farming conditions on the quality and shelf life of European sea bass, but it does not provide specific details about the format of the data used in their study.

Therefore, while the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline for fish grading is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that the input data is likely in the form of images.
