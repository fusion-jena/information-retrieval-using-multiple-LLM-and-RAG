The text provided does not explicitly mention the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does suggest an alternative method to prevent overfitting: increasing the size of the dataset.

The authors state that one way to improve the current accuracy of their cactus recognition model is to include more examples in the dataset, obtained under different conditions such as different daylight conditions or different year seasons. They explain that this will provide a distinctive context because the rainy season changes all valley's vegetation.

While the text does not mention regularization methods, it does discuss the use of data augmentation as a common practice to improve the accuracy of a deep learning model. Specifically, they compare the accuracy of the network when data augmentation is included during training, where patches are flipped vertically or horizontally with a probability of 0.5, in addition to resizing and normalization.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting, it does suggest an alternative method of increasing the size of the dataset and using data augmentation techniques.
