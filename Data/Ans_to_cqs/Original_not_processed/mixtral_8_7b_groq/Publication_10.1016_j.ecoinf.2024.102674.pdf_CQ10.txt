Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context contains several sources, but none of them mention or provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository for the deep learning pipeline.

However, the query regarding the wind-topo deep learning pipeline can be addressed by referring to the paper "Wind-topo: downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography in highly complex terrain with deep learning" by Dujardin and Lehning (2022). This paper describes the development of a deep learning model for downscaling wind fields in complex terrain. Although the specific code repository is not provided, the authors have published the methodology and results in the paper, which can be used for further study and replication.

To access the paper and its methodology, you can follow this link: <https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/qj.4195>
