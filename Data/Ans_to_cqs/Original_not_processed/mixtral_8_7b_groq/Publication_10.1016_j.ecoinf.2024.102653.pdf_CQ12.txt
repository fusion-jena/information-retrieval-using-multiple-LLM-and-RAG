Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), specifically a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network. This information can be inferred from section 2.3 of the provided context, which describes the deep neural network architecture used for predicting pesticide presence in bees. The model integrates two BiLSTM layers, designed to process three features: the daily number of flights, the duration spent outside each day, and the bee's age. These features are processed in a sequential manner, taking into account historical and future records, which is characteristic of RNNs.
