Answer:::
The provided context discusses a public challenge involving various systems for sound event detection, but it does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention some techniques that could be related to preventing overfitting.

One such technique is the use of k-shots for creating prototypes in the Prototypical system. By using a limited number of shots (examples) for each category, the model is forced to generalize better and not overfit to specific examples.

Another technique mentioned is the use of data augmentation, specifically in the context of the New templates Retrain system. Data augmentation can help prevent overfitting by creating new training examples through transformations of the original data.

The context also mentions the use of cross-entropy loss (x-ent) in some systems. Cross-entropy loss can act as a form of regularization by encouraging the model to make more confident predictions, which can help prevent overfitting.

However, the context does not mention dropout or L2 regularization explicitly. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by reducing co-adaptation between neurons. L2 regularization, on the other hand, adds a penalty term to the loss function that encourages smaller weights, which can help prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.

Therefore, while the context provides some insight into techniques that could be related to preventing overfitting, it does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization.
