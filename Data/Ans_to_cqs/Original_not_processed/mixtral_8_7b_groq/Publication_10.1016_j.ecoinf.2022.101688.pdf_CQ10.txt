Answer:::
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text describes various studies and methods involving the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for analyzing animal vocalizations, but it does not give any information about where the code for these projects can be found. I hope this helps!
