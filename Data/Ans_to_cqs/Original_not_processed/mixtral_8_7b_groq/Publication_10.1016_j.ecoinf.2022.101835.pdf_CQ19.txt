Answer:

The provided context describes the construction of machine learning models for estimating flowering dates, but it does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of TensorFlow 2.3.0 for building the ANN (Artificial Neural Network) models. TensorFlow is a popular open-source library for building and training machine learning and deep learning models. Therefore, it can be inferred that TensorFlow is used to build the ANN models in this study.

The ANN models are compared with RF (Random Forest) and GBDT (Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) models. The ANN models are coded in Python using Scikit-learn 1.0.1 and TensorFlow 2.3.0. The ANN models do not have any intermediate layers, and the model with the input layer followed by the output layer is determined to be the best.

In summary, based on the provided context, TensorFlow is used to build the ANN models, while Scikit-learn is used for the RF and GBDT models.
