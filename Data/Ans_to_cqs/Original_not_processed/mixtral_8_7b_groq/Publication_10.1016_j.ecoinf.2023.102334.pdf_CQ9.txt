Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context focuses on the use of a hybrid Transformer-CNN model for sika deer identification, discussing the Transformer model's origins in natural language processing and its application in computer vision. It references various papers and conferences, but none of them appear to contain information on the data repository.

The context includes a formula for calculating the expressive power of the network, descriptions of DenseNet and ResNet architectures, and a discussion of the use of deep learning methods in wildlife surveillance and face recognition for sheep. However, it does not mention where the data repository for the study is located.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context. It is possible that the data repository is mentioned in one of the papers referenced in the context, but the context itself does not provide enough information to determine this.
