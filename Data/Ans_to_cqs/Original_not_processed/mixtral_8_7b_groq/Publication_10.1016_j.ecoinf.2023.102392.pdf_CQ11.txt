Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The study discusses the use of the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model for classifying forest types and assessing the impact of flooding on endangered fish species in a northern province of Vietnam. However, there is no mention of a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline or the dataset used in the study.

The study does provide references to previous works by the authors, including studies on urban expansion trends in Lao Cai city, assessing the impact of flooding on fish species, and detecting the dispersal of butterfish under global warming. However, these studies do not appear to be related to the deep learning pipeline used in the current study.

Therefore, I am unable to provide a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study based on the provided context.
