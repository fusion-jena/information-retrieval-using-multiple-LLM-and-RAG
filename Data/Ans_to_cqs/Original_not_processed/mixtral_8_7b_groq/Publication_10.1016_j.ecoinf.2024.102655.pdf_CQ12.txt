The provided context does not mention the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. The models mentioned are machine learning models, specifically intelligent models based on the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). These models were used to predict the Water Quality Index (WQI) at the Kinta River basin using seven Water Quality Parameters (WQPs) as inputs. The efficiency of these models can be attributed to the precise data selection for model training using clusters and time series analysis. Therefore, I cannot provide the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline because it is not mentioned in the given context.
