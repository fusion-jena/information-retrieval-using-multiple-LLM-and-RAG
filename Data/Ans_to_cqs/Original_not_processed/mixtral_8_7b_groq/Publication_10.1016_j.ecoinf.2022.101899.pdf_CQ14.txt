Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text mentions the use of prior distributions for the model parameters, which can be either informative or noninformative. The variance of the normal prior expresses the weight of the prior information, with lower prior variance indicating a higher weight of prior information. However, there is no mention of any optimization techniques such as grid search or random search being used for hyperparameter tuning. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query without additional information.
