The provided context does not contain information on data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Instead, it focuses on urban areas, land cover, vegetation, wild rabbit conservation, and digital elevation models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query using the given context.

However, I can still answer the query based on my general knowledge. In deep learning pipelines, data annotation techniques are crucial for training models to understand and interpret visual data. Some common data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in an image. It helps the model learn the spatial location and size of objects.
2. Image segmentation: This technique involves dividing an image into multiple regions or segments, where each segment corresponds to a specific object or class. Image segmentation can be further divided into semantic segmentation and instance segmentation.
	* Semantic segmentation: This method assigns a class label to each pixel in an image, grouping similar pixels together.
	* Instance segmentation: This method not only assigns a class label to each pixel but also distinguishes individual instances of the same class.
3. Landmark annotation: This technique involves identifying and marking key points or landmarks on objects within an image. It is often used for facial recognition, human pose estimation, or object tracking.
4. Polygon annotation: Similar to bounding box annotation, this technique involves drawing polygons around objects of interest. Polygon annotation is more precise than bounding box annotation, as it can better capture the object's shape and contours.
5. Line annotation: This technique is used for annotating linear objects, such as roads, rivers, or boundaries.

These data annotation techniques enable deep learning models to learn and understand visual data, ultimately improving their performance in various applications, such as object detection, image classification, and semantic segmentation.
