Answer:::

The training of the deep learning model is carried out using a specific hardware environment, as described in the provided context. The CPU used for this purpose is an Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-9900K CPU @ 3.60GHz with 7200 BogoMips and a maximum CPU load of 99%. Additionally, a TITAN RTX GPU is utilized, which can reach a maximum GPU load of 99%. The working memory consists of 128 GB of RAM, and the data is stored on a Samsung 970 EVO Plus SSD with 500 GB. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Therefore, based on the given information, it can be concluded that the deep learning model is trained using a CPU, a GPU, and a solid-state drive for data storage, but there is no indication of TPUs being employed in this process.
