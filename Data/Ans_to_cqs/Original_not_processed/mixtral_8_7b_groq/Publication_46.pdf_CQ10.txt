Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. The study focuses on comparing the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with a conventional Species Distribution Model (SDM) called BIOCLIM. However, it does not mention or provide a link to the code repository for the implemented deep learning pipeline.

The study includes details about the methodology, data curation, formal analysis, and contributions of the authors. It also mentions the funding and institutional review board statement, but there is no information about the code repository or where to access the deep learning pipeline used in this research.

If you are interested in implementing a similar deep learning pipeline for SDM, you can refer to the Supplementary Materials provided in the study, which contains a table (Table S1) describing the methodology of the convolution and full connected layer. However, for the complete code implementation, you may need to reach out to the authors or look for similar open-source projects on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
