Answer:::

The postprocessing steps involved after the model training in the supervised learning workflow described in the text include the calculation of various metrics, such as overall accuracy, producer’s accuracy, and user’s accuracy, as well as the creation of a confusion matrix. However, the text does not mention the use of saliency maps in the postprocessing stage.

In the described workflow, after the training and validation datasets are created, the image segmentation step is performed (Section 2.3.3). This involves segmenting the aerial images into homogeneous regions based on their spectral and textural properties. Following image segmentation, the woody cover classification step is carried out (Section 2.3.4). This step involves classifying the segmented regions into either 'non-woody' or 'woody' cover classes based on the training data.

Once the woody cover classification is complete, the accuracy assessment is performed (Section 2.3.5). This involves calculating various metrics, such as overall accuracy, producer’s accuracy, and user’s accuracy, to evaluate the performance of the classification model. The overall accuracy is a measure of the proportion of correctly classified pixels in the entire image, while producer’s accuracy and user’s accuracy are measures of the proportion of correctly classified pixels for each class.

Additionally, a confusion matrix is created to provide a more detailed breakdown of the classification results. A confusion matrix is a table that compares the actual classes of the pixels with the classes assigned by the model. The matrix provides information on the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, which can be used to calculate the aforementioned accuracy metrics.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training in the described supervised learning workflow include the calculation of various metrics, such as overall accuracy, producer’s accuracy, and user’s accuracy, as well as the creation of a confusion matrix. However, the text does not mention the use of saliency maps in the postprocessing stage.
