Answer:::

The provided context discusses two data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline: "central-pixel labeling" and "semantic labeling."

"Central-pixel labeling" is a method where the initial pixels of the image are selected for learning. This technique is used in the U-net architecture [47], and it allows for creating balanced data sets. The balance is achieved by carefully selecting the initial pixels, ensuring that each class has an equal or similar number of pixels. This method is effective for the LU detection task, as mentioned in the study.

"Semantic labeling," on the other hand, is a more challenging technique for creating balanced data sets due to the composition of the images. Despite trying several methods, the study found negligible differences in performance. The median frequency balancing method was used for all reported experiments. This method is used in the Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) [48] and DeepLab [49] architectures.

The context does not mention other data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Bounding box annotation involves drawing a box around the object of interest, providing the network with a general idea of the object's location. Instance segmentation, meanwhile, involves segmenting each instance of an object in an image, providing the network with a precise outline of each object.

In summary, the provided context discusses two data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline: "central-pixel labeling" and "semantic labeling." Other techniques, such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation, are not mentioned in the context.
