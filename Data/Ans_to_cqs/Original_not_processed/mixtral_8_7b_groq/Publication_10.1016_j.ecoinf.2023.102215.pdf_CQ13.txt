Answer:::
The deep learning model used in the study is trained with the Adam optimizer, which uses default hyperparameters: betas=(0.9, 0.999) and eps=1.0 x 10^-8. The initial learning rate is set to lr=1.0 x 10^-3. The model is trained from scratch with a batch size of 12. The weight decay is set to 0. The model is trained for 65,000 iterations, taking approximately 11.5 hours to complete the training process. The training and test images are uniformly resized to 288 x 288 pixels. The model is implemented using PyTorch 1.13.0.1 and trained on a computer with a 14-core Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU, 80 GB RAM, and an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU with 24 GB memory.
