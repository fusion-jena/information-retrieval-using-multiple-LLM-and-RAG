The text provided does not give explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the proposed method demonstrates superior performance across a diverse range of environments. This suggests that a diverse dataset may have been used in the development of the model, which can help improve its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Additionally, the use of a joint training approach for image adaptive enhancement modules and deep learning models may also contribute to the model's generalizability. This approach ensures that the image processing results contribute to improved performance of the deep learning model, which could help the model learn more robust features that are applicable to a wider range of images.

It is also possible that other techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to further improve the model's generalizability, but the text does not provide explicit information on this. Therefore, while there are some indications that measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the specific measures are not specified in the provided context.
