Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information directly related to the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does contain information about research related to bird species, specifically the Band-tailed Nighthawk (Nyctiprogne leucopyga), and the use of data sources and tools for species distribution modeling and creating algorithms.

In the context of machine learning and deep learning, randomness can be introduced in various stages of the pipeline, such as data preprocessing, model initialization, and weight updates during training. Strategies to handle randomness include setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility, using techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting, and applying data augmentation methods to increase the diversity of the training data.

While the context does not explicitly mention these strategies, it does discuss the importance of data and data sources in the context of bird research. In the study by Wood et al. (2022), the BirdNET app is used to reduce barriers to global bird research by enabling citizen science participation, highlighting the value of large-scale data collection and the potential for addressing randomness through data augmentation techniques.

In summary, while the provided context does not contain specific information about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it emphasizes the importance of data and data sources in research, which can be applied to managing randomness through data-related techniques in machine learning and deep learning.
