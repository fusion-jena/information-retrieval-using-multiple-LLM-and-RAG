Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes details about the use of various technologies such as TensorFlow, CUDA, and cuDNN for building and hosting the model, as well as the use of a Samsung S10 for recording garden birds and uploading the acquired audio for classification. However, it does not mention where the code for this pipeline is located. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
