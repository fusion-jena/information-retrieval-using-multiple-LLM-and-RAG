I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not include information about the deep learning pipeline or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context discusses the use of subsetting background points in the training dataset to maintain consistency and reduce variation in model results, as well as the comparison of model performance using a single component model and an ensemble of models. However, it does not mention deep learning or any techniques used to prevent overfitting in that context.
