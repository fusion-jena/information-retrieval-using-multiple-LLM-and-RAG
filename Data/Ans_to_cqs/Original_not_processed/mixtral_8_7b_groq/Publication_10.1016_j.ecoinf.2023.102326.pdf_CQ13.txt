Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the use of deep learning models. Instead, it focuses on the application of Complex Network Analysis to Urban Acoustic Environments (AE) using Python 3.8.5 and specific packages. The analysis involves the calculation of the Average Shortest Path Length (ASPL) for networks constructed from power spectra data.

The text mentions some alternative methods for analyzing large audio datasets, such as classical approaches and sound event classification using machine learning. However, it does not offer details about the hyperparameters used in these methods.

In summary, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model since no deep learning model is mentioned or described in the text.
