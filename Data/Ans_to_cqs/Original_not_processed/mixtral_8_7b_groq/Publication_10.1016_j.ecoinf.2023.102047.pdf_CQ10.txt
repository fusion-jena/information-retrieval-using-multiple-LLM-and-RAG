Answer:::
I'm sorry for any inconvenience, but the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various methods and techniques used for seagrass coverage estimation and mapping using different deep learning models, such as encoder-decoder based models, deep capsule networks, and convolutional neural networks. However, it does not mention where the code for these models can be found. For more information on the code repository, I would recommend contacting the authors of the relevant research papers or checking their affiliated institutions' websites.
