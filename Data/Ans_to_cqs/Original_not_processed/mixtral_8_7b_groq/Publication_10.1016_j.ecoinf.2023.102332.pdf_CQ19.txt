Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The text focuses on word embedding techniques, such as Word2vec and GloVe, and their applications in semantic analysis of Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) from social media data. It discusses the use of pre-trained models, like the baroni word2vec model, and the process of training custom word2vec models using the CBOW algorithm. However, it does not mention any deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
