The context provided does not explicitly mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform for remote sensing big data applications. However, GEE is a platform specifically designed for data processing and analysis, and not typically used for deploying deep learning models.

Therefore, it is likely that the deep learning model was developed and trained using a different platform, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and then the trained model was implemented in GEE for processing and analyzing satellite data.

Without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
