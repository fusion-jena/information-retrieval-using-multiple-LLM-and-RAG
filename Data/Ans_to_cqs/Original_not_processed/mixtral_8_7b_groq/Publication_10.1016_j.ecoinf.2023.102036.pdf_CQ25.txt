Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model in this particular application is image classification in the field of fisheries. The deep learning model is used to identify and sort fish based on a number of classes. However, the dataset size is limited, with only a small number of labeled images available for each category. To overcome this limitation, the researchers are using existing deep learning techniques in combination with statistical fundamentals. This approach is a standard methodology for most research teams that are becoming familiar with deep learning approaches.
