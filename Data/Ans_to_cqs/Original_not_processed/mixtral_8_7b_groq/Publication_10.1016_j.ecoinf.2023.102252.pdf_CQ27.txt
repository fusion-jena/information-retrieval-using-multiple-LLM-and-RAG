Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, we can infer that the model was developed as part of a study about the impact of drought on vegetation, specifically in a region affected by drought from the mid-90s to late 2010.

The model's architecture and parameters were defined, and four parameter sets were used as ecological targets for FERM (Fuel Engineered Reduction Method). The model has several parameters, such as λ, D1, IC, ε, DIC, RIC, S2, γ, δ, ζ, η, d, Cw,1, Cw,0, and additional parameters for distance weighting. These parameters have specific value ranges and data types, such as real, integer, or [0, 1].

The study includes a discussion of the advantages and limitations of the model and future work in Section 6 and a summary of the main findings in Section 7. This suggests that the model was implemented and tested, but the context does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed, like model serialization or platform selection.

Answer:::
 Although the provided context contains information about the model's architecture, parameters, and testing, it does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
