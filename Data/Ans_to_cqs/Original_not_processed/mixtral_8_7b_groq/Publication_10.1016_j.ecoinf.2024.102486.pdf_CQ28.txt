Answer:::
Based on the information provided, the deep learning model was deployed on the Google Cloud Platform. Specifically, a CUDA-capable Virtual-Machine (VM) instance was created on Google Cloud. This was recommended because the necessary drivers and compilers for running GPU-accelerated code were pre-installed in the VM named "Debian 10 based Deep Learning VM with M97". The VM was launched using the 'Launch' button on the Google Cloud Marketplace, and specific hardware configurations such as 16GB of memory, an SSD boot drive of 30GB, and the number and type of GPUs were selected during the setup process. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Google Cloud Platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
