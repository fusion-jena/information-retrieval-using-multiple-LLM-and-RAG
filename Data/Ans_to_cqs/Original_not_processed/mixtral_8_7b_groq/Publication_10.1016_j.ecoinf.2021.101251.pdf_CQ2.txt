Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the data formats in the ESS-DIVE data repository, which includes data from projects like AmeriFlux, WFSFA, and NGEE-Tropics, could potentially be used in a deep learning pipeline associated with this repository.

The context mentions that these projects produce large numbers of high-quality, multi-disciplinary data packages, with each data package containing one or more data files and associated metadata. The data files could be in various formats, such as CSV (Comma-Separated Values) for tabular data, image formats like JPEG or PNG for visual data, audio formats like WAV or MP3 for audio data, and video formats like MP4 for video data.

Moreover, the deep learning algorithms can handle various data formats, and the choice of format depends on the specific problem and the type of data available. For instance, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for image analysis, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data like audio or text, and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) for tabular data like CSV files.

Therefore, while the text does not provide specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be assumed that the pipeline handles various data formats, including but not limited to image, audio, video, and CSV files, depending on the data sources and the specific requirements of the deep learning task.
