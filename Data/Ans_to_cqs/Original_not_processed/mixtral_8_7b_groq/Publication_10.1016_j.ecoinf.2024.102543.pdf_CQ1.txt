Answer:::

In the context provided, the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not detailed. However, it can be inferred that the data collection in this particular study involves images and videos acquired with drones.

The research focuses on detecting and counting a specific pest, named NBSB (Narrow Brown Band), in soybean fields. To this end, they used a public image dataset of NBSB in soybean fields and added a novel one with more images for testing their model. The images and videos were collected using drones, which implies the use of drone sensors to capture the data.

It is important to note that the choice of data collection method depends on the specific problem and context. In this case, using drones allows for large-scale data collection in agricultural settings, providing an aerial view of the fields and enabling the detection and counting of NBSB.

In general, deep learning pipelines can involve various data collection methods, such as:

1. Surveys: Collecting data through questionnaires or interviews to gather information from human respondents.
2. Sensors: Using sensors to collect data from the environment or specific objects. This can include data from cameras, microphones, accelerometers, GPS devices, or other specialized sensors.
3. Public datasets: Utilizing existing datasets that are publicly available for research purposes. These datasets can cover a wide range of domains, such as images, text, audio, or video.

In summary, while the specific methods for data collection are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that this study used drone sensors for data collection. In general, deep learning pipelines can involve surveys, sensors, or public datasets, depending on the specific problem and context.
