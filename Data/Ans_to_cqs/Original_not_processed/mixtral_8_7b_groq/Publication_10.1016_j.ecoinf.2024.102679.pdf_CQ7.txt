Answer:::

The text provided does not give explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it does mention that the pre-trained model underwent fine-tuning for four iterations using the entire SW stratum, and during each training stage, the model was selected based on the epoch that gave the best performance on the validation set. This suggests that the data was split in such a way as to allow for a validation set to be used in evaluating the model's performance during training.

Additionally, the text mentions that hard negative patches were collected and included during the fine-tuning process. This implies that there was a step in the data preparation process where false positives were identified and set aside to be used as hard negative patches. This step could be considered a form of data splitting, as it involves separating a subset of the data to be used for a specific purpose during training.

In summary, while the text does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it does suggest that a validation set was used and that a subset of the data was set aside for use as hard negative patches during fine-tuning.
