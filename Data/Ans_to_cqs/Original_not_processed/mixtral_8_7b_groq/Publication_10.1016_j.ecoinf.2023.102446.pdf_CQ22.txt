Based on the provided context, there is no information about the performance metrics used to evaluate a deep learning model. The text discusses the use of surrogates, a significance level of 1%, and network computation with lagged information for ecological data. It also mentions the calculation of average transfer entropy (TE) bits information and the average number of TE links for net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (RE), and latent heat (LH) at different lags.

However, these metrics are related to the analysis of ecological data and not the evaluation of deep learning models. Common performance metrics for deep learning models include:

1. Accuracy: the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions.
2. Precision: the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
3. Recall (Sensitivity): the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.
4. F1 score: the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
5. Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC): a metric that measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.

Since the provided context does not mention any of these performance metrics, the answer to the query is:

Answer:::
The provided context does not offer information on the performance metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model. Common performance metrics for deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUROC.
