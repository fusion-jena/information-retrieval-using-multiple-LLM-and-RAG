Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning model being trained or deployed. The context focuses on the use of Random Forest (RF), a machine learning algorithm, for classifying grassland attributes using remote sensing data.

The process followed for deploying the RF model involves several steps. First, the RF model was trained using 34 ground data points and the SAGA software. The training subset consisted of RGB images acquired in March, April, and May. The maximum shaft number value was tested from 1 to 100, and the minimum sample number from 1 to 50. The most accurate results for RF were obtained when the maximum tree depth was set to 10 and the minimum number of samples was set to 2.

After training, the RF model generates an impartial internal estimate of the generalization error by the "out-of-bag" (OOB) samples, which are those not included in the training subset. In this study, the total number of samples used for validation is 8.

Finally, the trained RF model was used to estimate the forage quantity and quality of semi-natural grasslands with Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data in QGIS software.

Therefore, the process followed to deploy the RF model involves training the model using SAGA software, validating it using OOB samples, and using the trained model for estimating grassland attributes in QGIS software. However, the context does not provide information on model serialization or platform selection for deploying the RF model.
