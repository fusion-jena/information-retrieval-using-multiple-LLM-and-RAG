Answer:::
The provided context does not include specific information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model for atmospheric correction (AC) in aquatic environments. However, it does mention the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) and two specific models, FLAASH and a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN).

For the FLAASH model, the context explains that it is an atmospheric correction module developed by the United States Air Force Laboratory, which improves the Modtran4 model. It does not rely on atmospheric parameter data obtained synchronously during remote sensing imaging and can perform AC for most satellite sensors in the wavelength range of 0.4–3 μm. The FLAASH model assumes that the target is approximately a Lambert surface, and the correction formula is provided in the context. However, the hyperparameters used in this model are not specified.

Regarding the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model, the context provides information on a comparative evaluation of DCNN and deep neural network-based land use/land cover classifications of mining regions using fused multi-sensor satellite data. However, it does not provide details on the specific hyperparameters used in the DCNN model for AC in aquatic environments.

In general, hyperparameters used in deep learning models for AC in aquatic environments may include learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, activation function, batch size, and number of epochs. The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. The optimizer is a method used to minimize the loss function. The number of layers and neurons determines the complexity of the model. The activation function introduces non-linearity into the model. Batch size is the number of training examples used in one iteration. The number of epochs is the number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model for AC in aquatic environments, it is mentioned that ANN and DCNN models are used, and general hyperparameters used in deep learning models are provided.
