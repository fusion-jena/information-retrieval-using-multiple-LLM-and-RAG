Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. There is no mention of any specific data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF where the data and code for the deep learning pipeline used in the study are stored. The context focuses more on the methodology and application of deep learning to classify 2D LiDAR images for forest classification. Therefore, I am unable to provide the data repository link based on the given information.
