Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it focuses on a study regarding Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and the use of climate datasets for machine learning models.

The climate data used in the study consists of two sets of variables: 27 climate extreme indices defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) and 19 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim. For both sets, observational and simulation data averaged for the years 1950-2000 represent the present-day climate, while simulation data averaged for the years 2061-2080 represent the expected climate in approximately 2070. These datasets are used to derive present-day and future ETCCDI indices from the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4), one of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) global climate models.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
