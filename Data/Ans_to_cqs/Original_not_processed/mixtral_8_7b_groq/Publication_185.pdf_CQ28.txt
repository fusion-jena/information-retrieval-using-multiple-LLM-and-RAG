Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the specific platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the feasibility of using a small amount of data to train deep learning models for image recognition, specifically for butterfly classification in the context of biodiversity. It mentions that experiments were performed on a small-size dataset without data augmentation and that the MG and MO models were able to achieve good training results and perform well on their validation sets. The CNN architecture known as AlexNet was used in the image classification process. However, there is no mention of the platform used for deployment.
