Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated which type of deep learning model, such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer, is used in the pipeline. The text focuses on the data collection, validation, and training processes for classifying Amur tiger trails using footprints.

The study mentions the use of a classification dendrogram generated with the FIT pairwise comparison model, but it does not specify whether this model is based on a deep learning architecture. The model is trained using 44 trails from captive Amur tigers and achieves 100% accuracy. This trained algorithm is then used to classify free-ranging Amur tiger trails.

In summary, while the context provides valuable information about the data and processes used in the study, it does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model applied in the pipeline.
