Answer:::

The deep learning model was built using the TensorFlow framework, specifically TensorFlow2. This information can be inferred from the statement that the deep learning models used a NASnet architecture implemented in Tensorflow2. Additionally, the models' parameters can be found on TensorFlow model zoo1 under the name “faster\_rcnn\_nas”.
