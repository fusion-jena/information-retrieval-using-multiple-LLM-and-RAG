Answer:::

I apologize, but the provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the details of the Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) models used for identifying potential drivers of changes in growth across two herring populations. It includes information about hyperparameter tuning, early stopping, and the top four most influential variables. However, it does not mention or provide a link to any data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
