The provided context does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the proposed AODEGRU model are optimized. However, it is mentioned that the model is trained using a training loop (steps 4-18 in the pseudocode) and that the model parameters are updated using an optimizer (step 26).

There are several methods for hyperparameter optimization, including grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves defining a grid of hyperparameter values and training the model for each combination of values. Random search involves randomly sampling hyperparameter values from a defined range and training the model for each sampled set of values. Bayesian optimization involves using a probabilistic model to determine the most promising hyperparameter values to try next.

Without more information, it is not possible to say for certain which method was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the proposed AODEGRU model. However, it is mentioned that the model was evaluated using 10-fold cross validation (as shown in Table 6), which suggests that some form of hyperparameter optimization was likely performed.

In summary, the provided context does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the proposed AODEGRU model are optimized. It is possible that grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization was used, but this is not explicitly stated.
