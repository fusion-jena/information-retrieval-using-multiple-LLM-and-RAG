Answer:::
The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model (IUC-NN) for the conservation status prediction of orchid species. It only mentions that the IUC-NN algorithm was implemented as an R package based on the Python TensorFlow library. TensorFlow supports both CPUs and GPUs for training, and TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) can also be used with TensorFlow for certain Google Cloud platforms. However, the specific hardware resources used in this study are not specified.
