The provided context does not give information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning models. It mainly focuses on the comparison of three deep convolutional neural networks (Unet, Pspnet, and Deeplabv3+) for generating high-precision Fractional Vegetation Coverage (FVC) in drylands using high-resolution (0.8 m) remote sensing images.

The text describes the architectures of Unet, Deeplabv3+, and the encoding stage of Deeplabv3+ model with MobileNetv2 and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module. However, it does not mention any details about the deployment platform.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide information on which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
