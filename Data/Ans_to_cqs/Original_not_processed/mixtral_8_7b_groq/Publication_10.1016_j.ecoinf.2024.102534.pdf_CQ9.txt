Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) data for the study of orchids. GBIF is a data repository that provides access to biodiversity data, but it is not specifically a repository for deep learning pipelines.

In the context, the following sources have used GBIF data:

* R. Vitri Garvita, Popi Aprilianti, Hary Wawangningrum, Elga Renjana, Elizabeth Handini, Melisnawati H. Angio, and Elok Rifqi Firdiana in their study "Gap between Science and Practice"
* Aninda Retno Utami Wibowo, Richa Kusuma Wati, Prima Wahyu Kusuma Hutabarat, Puguh Dwi Raharjo, and Saniyatun Marâ€™atus Solihah in their study "Phytogeography of New Guinean Orchids: Patterns of Conservation, Species Richness and Turnover"

It is possible that these authors have deposited their data and code in repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, or Dryad, but the context does not provide information on this. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query without additional information.
