Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text does not mention any specific techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization method.

However, it does mention that the feature extraction model is fine-tuned on a subset of 500 training samples, and model performance is re-evaluated on the test set at 10 sample increments using three different sample orderings. This suggests that there may be some kind of iterative process involved in model development, where the model is trained and evaluated multiple times with different subsets of data.

Additionally, the text mentions that the Listening Lab Annotator Tool has been implemented to demonstrate the functionality of the annotator and methodology workflow. It is possible that the tool includes features for hyperparameter optimization, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

In summary, while the provided context does not give a clear answer to the query about hyperparameter optimization, it does suggest that there may be some kind of iterative process involved in model development. However, further information would be needed to provide a definitive answer.
