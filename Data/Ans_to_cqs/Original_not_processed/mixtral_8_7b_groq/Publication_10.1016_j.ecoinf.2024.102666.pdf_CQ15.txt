Answer:::

In the deep learning pipeline, several optimization techniques are employed to effectively train models and improve their performance. These techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and others.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular optimization algorithm used in deep learning. It is an iterative method for minimizing the loss function of a model by updating the model's parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function concerning each parameter. SGD's stochastic nature comes from the fact that it estimates the gradient using a single training example or a small batch of examples at each iteration, rather than the entire training dataset. This makes SGD computationally efficient and suitable for training large neural networks.

Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is another optimization algorithm commonly used in deep learning. Adam combines the ideas of two other optimization methods, AdaGrad and RMSProp, to adaptively adjust the learning rate for each parameter during training. Adam estimates the first and second moments of the gradient, which allows it to maintain a moving average of the gradient and its squared values. These estimates help Adam to scale the learning rate for each parameter, making it more robust to noisy gradients and suitable for a wide range of deep learning problems.

In addition to SGD and Adam, there are other optimization techniques used in deep learning, such as RMSProp, Adadelta, and Adagrad. These methods also adaptively adjust the learning rate for each parameter, but they differ in how they estimate the gradient's moments or use other strategies to improve convergence and robustness.

When applying these optimization techniques to deep learning models, it is essential to consider factors such as the learning rate, batch size, and the number of iterations or epochs. Properly tuning these hyperparameters can significantly impact the model's performance and convergence behavior.

In the context of remote sensing and artificial neural networks (ANN), optimization techniques like SGD and Adam are used to train models for tasks such as atmospheric correction (AC) and land cover classification. For instance, in the study by Li et al. (2023a), the authors used a deep learning model for AC in aquatic environments, and they likely employed an optimization algorithm like Adam or SGD to train their model. Similarly, in the study by Kumar and Gorai (2023), the authors compared deep convolutional neural networks and deep neural networks for land use/land cover classification, and they might have used optimization techniques like Adam or SGD during the training process.
