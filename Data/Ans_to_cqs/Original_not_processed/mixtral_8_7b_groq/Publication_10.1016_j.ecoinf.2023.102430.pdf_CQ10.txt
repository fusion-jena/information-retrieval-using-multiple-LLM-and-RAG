Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context focuses on the application of convolutional neural networks in identifying major triatomine genera to aid in the control of Chagas disease. While it mentions the use of advanced neural information processing systems, it does not give a specific link to the code repository.
