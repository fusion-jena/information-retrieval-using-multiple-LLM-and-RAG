Based on the provided context, there is limited information about the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that deep learning strategies, such as neural networks, were used in a limited number of studies. Therefore, while not explicitly stated in the context, it is common practice in machine learning, including deep learning, to perform certain preprocessing steps to prepare the data for training.

These preprocessing steps typically include:

1. Data cleaning: This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistent data.

2. Data normalization or scaling: This is the process of transforming the data to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1, or within a specific range (e.g., 0 to 1). Normalization helps to ensure that all features have equal importance during training, especially when dealing with features measured on different scales.

3. Feature engineering or selection: This step involves selecting relevant features for the model, or creating new features based on existing ones. Feature engineering can help improve model performance by reducing dimensionality, removing irrelevant features, or creating interaction terms.

In the context of ecological informatics and species distribution modeling, the provided information suggests that anthropogenic variables, such as fishing and boating activities, are increasingly being incorporated into models. This implies that data preprocessing might also include merging and processing data from various sources, such as environmental and human activity data, before training the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, it is common practice in machine learning to perform data cleaning, normalization or scaling, and feature engineering or selection. Additionally, in the context of ecological informatics and species distribution modeling, data preprocessing might also include merging and processing data from various sources related to environmental and human activity data.
