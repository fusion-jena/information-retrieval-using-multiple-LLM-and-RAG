Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, the context does mention the use of a mathematical model (MOP) for land use optimization and the evaluation of the model's performance.

The MOP model involves the objective function f1(x) and f2(x) for ecological benefit and economic benefit, respectively. The model also includes various parameters such as EBi, ESVi, VCij, D, Ir, Pr, Iw, Pw, Ic, Pc, and Eij, among others. The performance of the MOP model is evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE) of the PLUS model's analysis of the drivers of expansion for the six land types in the YRB-SX for the years 2000-2010 and 2010-2020.

Therefore, while there is no explicit mention of postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, the context does suggest that the performance of the MOP model is evaluated using the RMSE of the PLUS model's analysis of the drivers of expansion for the different land types.

Answer:::
The postprocessing steps involved after the training of the MOP model for land use optimization include the evaluation of the model's performance using the root mean square error (RMSE) of the PLUS model's analysis of the drivers of expansion for the different land types. However, there is no explicit information about other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.
