Answer:::

The raw data in the deep learning pipeline for tree detection is collected using Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensors, as described in the study. LIDAR is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances. It is capable of generating high-resolution, three-dimensional information about the physical characteristics of the landscape and the objects within it, making it an ideal tool for tree detection and measurement. The LIDAR data is then used as input for an unsupervised detection algorithm, which generates initial training data for a deep learning model. This model is then retrained based on a small number of hand-annotated trees to create the full model. The study also mentions the potential use of hyperspectral data, which could provide additional insights into the economic value, ecological habitat, and carbon storage capacity for large geographic areas. However, the context does not provide information on whether hyperspectral data is used in the deep learning pipeline or how it is collected.

Additionally, the study uses data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) site at the San Joaquin Experimental Range in California to assess the proposed approach. NEON is a continental-scale research infrastructure that provides open access to data collected from terrestrial, aquatic, and atmospheric sensors. The NEON data is publicly available and can be used for a variety of research purposes, including the development and testing of deep learning models for tree detection.
