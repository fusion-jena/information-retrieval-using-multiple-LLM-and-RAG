Answer:::

The provided context describes the training of a deep learning model for fish detection using a NASnet architecture with a Faster-rcnn backbone implemented in Tensorflow2. While the text does not explicitly list all the preprocessing steps applied to the data, it does mention some steps that can be considered as part of the preprocessing pipeline.

Firstly, the images were resized to 1333 Ã— 800 pixels to match the pre-training data (COCO dataset) used for the first layers of the model. This step can be considered as image resizing or scaling, which is a common preprocessing step in computer vision tasks.

Secondly, the authors used a learning rate of 0.008 with a cosine learning rate decay. Although not a data preprocessing step, it is a hyperparameter tuning technique that can affect the training of the model.

Thirdly, the model was trained on its own version of Trainingclips through 200,000 iterations with a batch size of 16 images per iteration. This step involves data splitting, where the dataset is divided into training and validation sets.

The context does not mention any other preprocessing steps such as data normalization, cleaning, or augmentation. However, it is essential to note that data preprocessing is a crucial step in deep learning pipelines, and the choice of preprocessing techniques depends on the dataset and the problem at hand. Common preprocessing techniques include data normalization (scaling features to a common range), data cleaning (removing outliers or missing values), and data augmentation (artificially increasing the size of the dataset by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, or flipping).
