Answer: Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in the study uses image data format. The dataset mentioned in the text consists of various years, but there is no explicit information about the type of data. However, the pre-processing steps and the description of the image enhancement technique suggest that the dataset is composed of images.

The authors mention a novel image pre-processing technique and testing various state-of-the-art deep learning models for image classification. Additionally, the comparison table (Table 3) presents the accuracy and F1-score of five different deep learning models, which are typically used for image or object detection tasks.

Furthermore, the authors compare their proposed dataset with the PlanVillage dataset, which is an image dataset. They also mention using an augmented version of PlanVillage, implying that the dataset is image-based.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in the study uses image data format. However, there is no explicit information about other data formats, such as audio, video, or CSV.
