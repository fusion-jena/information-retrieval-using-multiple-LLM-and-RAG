The provided context does not give specific information about the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline for identifying bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings. The context only mentions a "convolutional neural network" in the title of a related paper, but it does not specify whether this is the model used in the pipeline in question. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
