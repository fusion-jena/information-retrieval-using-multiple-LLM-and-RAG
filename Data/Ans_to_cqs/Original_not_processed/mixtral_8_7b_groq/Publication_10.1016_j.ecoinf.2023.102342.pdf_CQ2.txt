The provided context does not specifically mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss data mining and the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, which includes data acquisition and processing. In the context of data mining, various data formats can be used, depending on the specific study and objectives.

For instance, in the context of analyzing pesticide mixtures, Junghans et al. (2006) might have used structured data formats, such as CSV or Excel files, to store and process the chemical and toxicological information of the pesticides. Similarly, in the context of nutrient removal effectiveness by riparian buffer zones, Tan et al. (2019) might have used geospatial data formats, such as GeoJSON or Shapefiles, to store and process the location and environmental data of the buffer zones and water bodies.

In the context of data mining and KDD, the data format is often determined by the data source and the research question. Data mining techniques can be applied to various data formats, including structured data (e.g., CSV, Excel, SQL), semi-structured data (e.g., XML, JSON), and unstructured data (e.g., text, image, audio, video). The choice of data format depends on the nature of the data, the research question, and the data mining techniques used.

Therefore, while the provided context does not specifically mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline, it is clear that various data formats can be used in data mining and KDD, depending on the specific study and objectives.
