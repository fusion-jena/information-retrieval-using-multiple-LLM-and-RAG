Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline can utilize various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files, depending on the specific application and problem being addressed.

For instance, in the context of predicting infectious diseases using remote sensing techniques, Keshavamurthy et al. (2022) mentioned the use of remote sensing data, which typically come in the form of multispectral or hyperspectral images. These images can be used as input to deep learning models for land cover classification, land use analysis, or other relevant tasks that can help predict the risk of infectious diseases.

In another study, Gonz´alez Jim´enez et al. (2019) used mid-infrared spectroscopy data to predict mosquito species and population age structure. These data can be considered as a type of image data, where each pixel corresponds to a specific wavelength of light, and the intensity of that wavelength is recorded for each sample. These data can be used as input to deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spectral analysis and classification tasks.

Deep learning models can also be applied to time-series data, such as audio or video recordings. For example, in the context of analyzing and minimizing the effects of vector-borne diseases, Kaur et al. (2021) mentioned the use of machine and deep learning techniques for time-series forecasting. These techniques can be applied to audio or video recordings, where the data are represented as a sequence of observations over time.

Finally, deep learning models can also be applied to tabular data, such as CSV files. For instance, in the context of classification and regression training, Khun (2022) discussed the use of the caret package in R for machine learning, which can be used for training and evaluating deep learning models on tabular data. Similarly, the VSURF package in R (VSURF, n.d.) can be used for variable selection and feature extraction on tabular data, which can be used as input to deep learning models.

In summary, deep learning models can be applied to various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files. The specific data format used depends on the problem being addressed and the available data.
