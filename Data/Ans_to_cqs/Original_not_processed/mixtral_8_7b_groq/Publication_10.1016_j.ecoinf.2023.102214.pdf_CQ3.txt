Answer:::

The data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for snow leopard image classification involve creating machine learning-detected bounding boxes around snow leopards in photos. This is referred to as bounding box annotation. The annotations were created using a computer vision model based on machine learning and were then coupled with human identification of known individuals. These annotations served as the core data from which the machine learning (ML) algorithms learned and against which they were assessed.

The specific data annotation technique used here is bounding box annotation, where rectangular boxes are drawn around the object of interest (in this case, snow leopards) in an image. This technique is commonly used in object detection tasks in computer vision, as it allows the model to learn the spatial location and size of the object within an image.

It is important to note that the data annotation process was rigorous and involved subsetting the annotations into individuals using a graph matching technique. This step was crucial for training the PIE (Probabilistic Individual Embeddings) model, which required a minimum of three annotations of a side for each individual.

The context does not mention any other data annotation techniques such as instance segmentation, which involves labeling each pixel of the object of interest in an image. Therefore, based on the provided context, bounding box annotation is the primary data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline for snow leopard image classification.
