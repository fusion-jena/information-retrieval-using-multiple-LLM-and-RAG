Answer:

The text provided does not give a detailed description of the data collection methods for raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of sensors and the generation of data files.

According to the text, raw data is collected using sensors, as indicated by the "E-Field_Log" and "Data_File(s)" which are associated with "Sensor_FieldName." The data collected by the sensors is then stored in data files, which can be raw or processed. The "Data_Column_Description" file contains information about the data columns in these files.

There is also a mention of "sample-based campaigns" and "Field_Event_Log" which suggests that data may be collected through surveys or other types of data collection campaigns. However, the text does not provide specific details about these methods.

Furthermore, there is no mention of public datasets being used as a source of raw data.

In summary, the text indicates that raw data is collected using sensors, and this data is stored in data files. There is also a suggestion that data may be collected through surveys or other types of data collection campaigns. However, the text does not provide specific details about these methods, and there is no mention of public datasets being used as a source of raw data.
