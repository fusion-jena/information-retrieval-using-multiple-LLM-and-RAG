Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, I can suggest a common approach used in many deep learning applications.

In deep learning, data splitting is crucial for building robust models and evaluating their performance. Typically, the dataset is divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing.

1. Training set: This is the portion of the data used to train the model. The model learns patterns from this set and adjusts its parameters accordingly.
2. Validation set: Also known as the development set, this part of the data is used during the model training process to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. The model is evaluated on the validation set after each training epoch, and the performance is monitored to adjust learning rates, regularization techniques, or other hyperparameters.
3. Testing set: This is the final, unseen portion of the data used to evaluate the model's performance. The model should ideally perform well on this set, as it has not been exposed to it during training or hyperparameter tuning.

The common split ratios for these subsets are:

* Training set: 60-70%
* Validation set: 15-20%
* Testing set: 15-20%

However, the actual split ratios can vary depending on the dataset size, problem complexity, and specific deep learning application.

In summary, although the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria for splitting data in deep learning model training, a common approach is to divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets. These subsets help train robust models, tune hyperparameters, and evaluate model performance.
