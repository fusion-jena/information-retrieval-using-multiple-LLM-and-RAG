Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the use of machine learning ensembles, specifically RandomForest and MARS regression splines, for predicting Short-billed Gull presence/absence using socio-economic and geographic data. While these techniques can help prevent overfitting to some extent, they are not the same as the regularization methods specifically mentioned in the query. Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which encourages the model to have smaller weights and thus be less prone to overfitting the training data. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query based on the provided context.
