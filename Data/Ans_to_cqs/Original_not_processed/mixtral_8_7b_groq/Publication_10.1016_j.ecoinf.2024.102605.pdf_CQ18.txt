Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The sources discuss various models and techniques used for plant disease detection, water status prediction, and monitoring chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, but they do not mention the monitoring of model performance during training. Monitoring model performance during training can involve various strategies such as using validation sets, tracking training and validation loss, and implementing early stopping to prevent overfitting. However, without specific information from the sources, a detailed answer cannot be provided.
