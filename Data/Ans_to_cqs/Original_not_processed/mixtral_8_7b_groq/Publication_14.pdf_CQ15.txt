Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in the context provided utilizes dropout as an optimization technique to reduce overfitting. Dropout is a regularization method that randomly removes a proportion of nodes during training, preventing the network from becoming too reliant on any single node. This helps to improve the generalization ability of the model and reduces the likelihood of overfitting to the training data.

However, the text does not explicitly mention any optimization techniques related to the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) family, such as SGD with momentum, Adagrad, Adadelta, or Adam. These optimization algorithms are commonly used in deep learning to adjust the weights of the network during training, and they can have a significant impact on the training process and the final performance of the model.

It is possible that the authors used one of these optimization algorithms as the default setting in their deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow) and did not find it necessary to mention it explicitly in the text. Nonetheless, based on the provided context, it is not possible to definitively answer this question without additional information.
