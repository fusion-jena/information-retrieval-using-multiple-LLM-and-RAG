Based on the provided context, there is no information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. The context focuses on a method for generating redescriptions, which are defined as local patterns in data. The method involves setting parameters for the size of the support of the output redescriptions and controlling the length and complexity of their queries. The process for generating redescriptions includes running the method twice with different constraints, filtering the collections of redescriptions, and ranking and removing redescriptions with high similarity to more accurate ones. The queries used in the method involve dental and climate variables, and the second run allows for disjunctions and up to three variables in climate queries. However, there is no mention of deploying a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
