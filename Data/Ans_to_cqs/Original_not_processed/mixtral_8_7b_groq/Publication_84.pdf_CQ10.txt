Answer:::

 Unfortunately, based on the provided context, there is no specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the article "Development of spectral-phenological features for deep learning to understand Spartina alterniflora invasion" by Tian et al. (2020). The article discusses the development of a deep learning model for understanding the invasion of Spartina alterniflora in the coastal zone, but it does not provide a link to the code repository. It is possible that the code is not publicly available or was not shared by the authors.
