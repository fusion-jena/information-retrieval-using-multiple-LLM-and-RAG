Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer that the model was likely serialized and then integrated into a system or platform for processing and analyzing satellite data.

The context mentions the use of various satellite datasets, including Sentinel-2, Landsat 7 and 8, and PlanetScope, for studying wetlands and wetland use intensity in East Africa. It is mentioned that the S2cloudless Cloud Probability dataset with a spatial resolution of 10 m was used. This suggests that the deep learning model was likely trained on high-resolution satellite data to detect and classify cloud cover.

Furthermore, the context mentions that the study area was divided into plots, and the overall proportion of the complete dataset was representative of land use classes in the study area. This implies that the trained model was applied to the satellite data to generate land use classifications for the study area.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the trained deep learning model was serialized and then integrated into a platform or system for processing and analyzing satellite data. The serialized model would have been loaded into the system and applied to the satellite data to generate land use classifications. However, the specific details of the platform selection and deployment process are not provided in the context.
