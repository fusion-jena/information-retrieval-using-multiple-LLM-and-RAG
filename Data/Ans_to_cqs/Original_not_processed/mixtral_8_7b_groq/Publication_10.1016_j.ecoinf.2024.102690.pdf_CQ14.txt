Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the optimization of hyperparameters using techniques such as grid search or random search. The text focuses on the application of the ecological network connectivity index in different scenarios and the identification of ecological barriers, disturbance points, and pinch points. It also discusses the classification of ecological corridors and their spatial distribution in the research area.

However, the optimization of the α, β, and γ indices could be considered as a form of hyperparameter optimization. The α index is calculated as the cost ratio of corridors, while β and γ are related to the number of corridors and nodes in the network. These indices are adjusted according to the specific scenarios and land-use types. For instance, a search radius of 320 m was established for Scenario A by computing the total area of cropland and the accompanying cropland pressure index for each sub-district in Guangzhou. Similarly, a search radius of 200 m was set for Scenario B and 500 m for Scenario C based on planning documents. This adaptive adjustment of the indices according to the scenarios could be seen as a form of manual hyperparameter optimization.

Additionally, the selection of the number of Thiessen polygons, standard deviation of area, and mean value of area for the three methods (ES bundles, ESs importance assessment, and morphological spatial pattern analysis) could also be considered as hyperparameter optimization. The authors have chosen these parameters based on the specific requirements of their analysis.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of techniques like grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization, it does discuss the adaptive adjustment of the α, β, and γ indices and the selection of other parameters according to the scenarios and methods, which could be seen as a form of manual hyperparameter optimization.
