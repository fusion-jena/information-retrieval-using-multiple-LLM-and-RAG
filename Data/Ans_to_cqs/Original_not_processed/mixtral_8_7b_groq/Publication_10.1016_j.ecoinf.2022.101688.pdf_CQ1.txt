The provided context does not give specific information about how the raw data was collected for the bioacoustic datasets used in the study. However, it does mention that the datasets are for lemurs, gibbons, whydah, and alethe, which suggests that the data was collected from these species in their natural habitats.

One possible method for collecting raw data in bioacoustic studies is through the use of sensors or microphones placed in the environment to record animal vocalizations. These sensors can be deployed in a variety of settings, such as forests, grasslands, or aquatic environments, and can be used to capture audio data over long periods of time.

Another possible method for collecting raw data is through surveys or direct observations of animals in the wild. Researchers may conduct visual or auditory surveys to locate and identify animals, and then use recording equipment to capture their vocalizations. In some cases, researchers may even be able to record vocalizations directly from individual animals using handheld or wearable microphones.

Additionally, it is also possible that some of the datasets used in the study were obtained from public repositories or databases. Public datasets can be a valuable resource for bioacoustic research, as they provide access to large amounts of data that has already been collected and processed.

Overall, the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for bioacoustic research will depend on the species being studied and the research questions being addressed. A combination of sensor-based recordings, surveys, and public datasets may be used to collect the data needed for a given study.
