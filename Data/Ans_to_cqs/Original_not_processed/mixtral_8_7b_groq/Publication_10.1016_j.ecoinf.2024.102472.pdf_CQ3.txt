Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), specifically the Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLPNNs), and their application in estimating carbon stocks.

However, it can be inferred that some form of data labeling or annotation was conducted before training the MLPNN, as the model was able to compare output values to expected values for error computation during the training phase. This implies that the input data was associated with corresponding output or target values, which is a type of data annotation.

In general, data annotation techniques in deep learning can include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in images, providing the coordinates of the boxes as annotations. These annotations help deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to learn object detection and localization.

2. Instance segmentation: This method involves labeling each pixel in an image to indicate the object it belongs to, providing a more precise annotation than bounding box annotation. Instance segmentation helps deep learning models not only detect objects but also distinguish between individual instances of the same object type.

3. Semantic segmentation: Similar to instance segmentation, semantic segmentation labels pixels in an image according to the object class. However, it does not differentiate between individual instances of the same class.

4. Class labeling: This technique involves assigning a class label to each data point or example in a dataset. This is commonly used in supervised learning tasks, where a model learns to predict the class label given input features.

Given the focus of the provided context on ANNs and carbon stock estimation, it is likely that class labeling was used as the data annotation technique. However, specific details about the annotation techniques are not provided in the context.
