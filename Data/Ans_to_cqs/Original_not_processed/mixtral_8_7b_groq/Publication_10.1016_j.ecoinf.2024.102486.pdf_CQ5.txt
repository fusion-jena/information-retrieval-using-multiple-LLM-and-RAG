Answer:::

The context provided does not specify the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some deep learning tools and applications. Commonly used deep learning toolboxes include the Deep Learning Toolbox by MathWorks, cuDNN, and Darknet. These tools are often used for machine learning applications such as image and audio classification.

For instance, Nanni et al. (2020) used data augmentation approaches for improving analysis on many-core CPUs and GPUs in animal audio classification. Meanwhile, Atila et al. (2021) used machine learning for recognition and classification of visual images.

As for the software tools, popular choices include TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch, which provide accessible extensions to the Python programming language. These tools are used in various deep learning applications, including image recognition and classification.

In terms of hardware, the context recommends using a CUDA-capable Virtual-Machine (VM) instance on Google Cloud for deep learning projects. Specifically, it suggests using a VM named "Debian 10 based Deep Learning VM with M97" as it comes with necessary drivers and compilers pre-installed.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention various deep learning tools, applications, and hardware commonly used in the field.
