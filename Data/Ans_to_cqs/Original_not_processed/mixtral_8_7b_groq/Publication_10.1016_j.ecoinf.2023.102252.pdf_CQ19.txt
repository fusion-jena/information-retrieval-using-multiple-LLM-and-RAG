Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about which deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used to build the model. The abstract mentions that the article discusses the advantages and limitations of an environmental flow model for riparian ecosystems and wetlands, focusing on biodiversity maintenance. It highlights the trade-off between the detailed modeling of physical processes and the significant data requirements and computational costs. However, it does not specify the use of any deep learning frameworks.

The table in the context provides parameters for the FERM (Flow-Ecology-Resistance-Morphology) model, which is a conceptual framework for understanding the interactions between hydrological and ecological processes in river systems. While this framework is crucial for the development of the environmental flow model, it does not directly indicate the use of deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

In summary, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which deep learning frameworks were used to build the model.
