Answer:

Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the amount of training data, improve model performance, and reduce overfitting. These techniques involve creating modified versions of the existing data through various transformations. While the specific techniques used in the provided sources may not be exhaustive, I will outline some common data augmentation methods mentioned or related to the texts.

1. Flipping: Flipping is a horizontal or vertical reflection of the image. Horizontal flipping, also known as left-right flipping, is more common and helps the model generalize better by considering symmetrical patterns in the data. This technique is mentioned in the paper by Zmarz et al. (2023), although not specifically in the context of image data.

2. Rotating: Rotating the image at various angles can help the model learn features invariant to orientation. This technique is not explicitly mentioned in the provided sources, but it is a common data augmentation method for image data.

3. Scaling: Scaling or resizing the image is another common data augmentation technique. It can help the model learn features that are scale-invariant. This technique is related to the works of Zhang et al. (2016, 2003), who blend Landsat and MODIS data with different spatial resolutions for vegetation analysis.

4. Color jittering: Color jittering involves randomly changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue of the image. This technique can help the model learn features that are robust to illumination changes. Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided sources, color jittering is a common data augmentation method for image data.

5. Translation: Translation involves shifting the image in the horizontal or vertical direction. This technique can help the model learn features that are position-invariant. This method is related to the works of Beck et al. (2006, 2011), who analyze vegetation dynamics using MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data.

6. Elastic deformation: Elastic deformation involves applying a random, smooth deformation to the image. This technique can help the model learn features that are shape-invariant. This method is related to the works of Barr√© et al. (2017), who develop LeafNet, a computer vision system for automatic plant species identification.

In summary, data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, color jittering, translation, and elastic deformation are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to improve model performance and reduce overfitting. While not all of these techniques are explicitly mentioned in the provided sources, they are closely related to the works discussed.
