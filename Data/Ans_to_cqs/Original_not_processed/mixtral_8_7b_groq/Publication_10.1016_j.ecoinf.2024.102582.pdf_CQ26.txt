The provided pieces of context do not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, they do describe some preprocessing steps that can help reduce data bias indirectly.

One preprocessing step described in context (2) is the creation of training samples using Google Earth Pro to randomly generate sample points in the image of the study area for each year. These sample points were then imported into the GEE application programming interface (API) for further analysis and divided into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio. This stratified sampling approach can help ensure that the training dataset is representative of the overall population and reduce data bias.

Another preprocessing step described in context (3) is the use of a manual visual interpretation approach to correct the image classification results for mangroves within a 10-km buffer zone extending inland from the coastline. This procedure effectively corrected misclassifications between forest and mangroves resulting from "spectral confusion". By manually correcting misclassifications, this step can help ensure that the training data accurately reflects the true land cover types and reduce data bias.

The paper by Chen et al. (2024) mentioned in the context describes the use of landscape fragmentation indices to evaluate the number of land cover types, distances between patches of the same land cover type, and the degrees of aggregation and segmentation. While not directly related to data bias reduction, these metrics can help ensure that the training data accurately reflects the spatial distribution and configuration of land cover types, which can indirectly reduce data bias.

In summary, while the provided pieces of context do not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, they do describe some preprocessing steps that can help reduce data bias indirectly, such as stratified sampling, manual correction of misclassifications, and evaluation of landscape fragmentation indices.
