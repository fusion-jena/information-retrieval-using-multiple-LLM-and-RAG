Answer:::

The text provided does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline using techniques such as random seed values. However, it does mention the use of various hyperparameters, such as min-batch size and the number of layers in a network, which can be used to control the behavior of a deep learning algorithm.

In the context of min-batch size, the text mentions that the choice of min-batch size can affect the accuracy of the algorithm and the number of epochs required for convergence. Specifically, a min-batch size of 128 is found to result in high accuracy and a relatively small number of epochs. This suggests that carefully choosing the min-batch size can help to reduce the impact of randomness on the training process.

The text also mentions that the number of layers in a network can affect the min-batch size and the computational cost of the algorithm. For example, the VGG-19 network has a large number of layers, which results in a smaller min-batch size compared to other networks. This may indicate that the VGG-19 network is more sensitive to randomness in the training data, and that careful tuning of the network architecture and hyperparameters may be necessary to achieve good performance.

In addition, the use of techniques such as cross-validation, as mentioned in Table 2, can help to reduce the impact of randomness on the performance of a deep learning algorithm. Cross-validation involves dividing the available data into multiple folds, and training and testing the algorithm on each fold. This can help to ensure that the algorithm is not overfitting to any particular subset of the data, and can result in more reliable performance estimates.

Overall, while the text does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline using techniques such as random seed values, it does suggest that careful choice of hyperparameters and the use of techniques such as cross-validation can help to reduce the impact of randomness on the training process.
