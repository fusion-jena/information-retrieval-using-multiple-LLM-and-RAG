Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for Fv/Fm parameter estimation. However, it does discuss the differences between XGBoost and deep learning models, one of which is the performance on small datasets. Deep learning models typically require substantial datasets to achieve optimal results, while XGBoost can demonstrate effectiveness even with limited data.

In general, deep learning models in computer vision are often trained on large and well-known datasets such as MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, CIFAR for object recognition, and ImageNet for large-scale image classification. These datasets provide a diverse range of images and labels that help deep learning models learn to recognize patterns and make predictions.

In the context of Fv/Fm parameter estimation in spring wheat using UAV-based multispectral and RGB imagery, the study by Wu et al. (2023) may have used a specific dataset that is not mentioned in the provided text. To find out more about the dataset used in this study, it would be necessary to refer to the original research article or contact the authors directly.
