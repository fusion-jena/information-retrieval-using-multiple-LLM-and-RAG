Based on the provided context, there is no information about the deployment of a trained deep learning model. The text mainly discusses the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques, specifically Random Forests (RF), to classify maturity in Chilean hake. It mentions the effectiveness of RF in classifying maturity stages, but it does not provide details about the serialization or platform selection process for any deep learning models. Furthermore, the text states that the data used in the study is confidential and does not provide any information about data preprocessing or model training procedures that are typically associated with model deployment. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
