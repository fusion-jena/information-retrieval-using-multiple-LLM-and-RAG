Answer:::
The pieces of context provided do not specify a particular type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, they do mention the use of neural networks for image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Specific architectures like UNet (Ronneberger et al., 2015) and DeepLabV3 (Chen et al., 2017) are mentioned for semantic segmentation. These architectures are typically based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are a popular choice for image-related tasks due to their ability to effectively extract and learn spatial hierarchies of features from image data.

Moreover, the context also mentions supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning methods for training neural networks. Among these, supervised learning is the most relevant for image classification and semantic segmentation tasks, as it involves learning a mapping from input images to output labels using a labeled dataset.

In summary, while the pieces of context do not explicitly name the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline, they suggest the use of CNN-based architectures for semantic segmentation and image classification tasks in a supervised learning setting.
