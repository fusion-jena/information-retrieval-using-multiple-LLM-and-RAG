Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context describes the process and methods used for spectral segmentation and band selection, as well as the impact of different data formats on classification accuracy. It also explains the steps taken to build and train the deep learning model using Keras and TensorFlow. However, there is no mention of where the code for this pipeline is available. It is possible that the code has not been made publicly available, or it may be hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. If you are interested in accessing the code, you may want to contact the authors of the study for more information.
