Answer:::

I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the comparison of different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, such as VGG16, Xception, ResNet-50, DenseNet121, and a proposed model, in terms of their architecture, performance, and execution time. However, it does not mention any code repository or its location, be it on GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other platform.
