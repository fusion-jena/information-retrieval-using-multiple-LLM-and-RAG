Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does mention a linear transformation technique used to mitigate the effect of hardware variance on the learned representation.

The text states, "we demonstrate how a simple linear transformation can be used to mitigate the effect of hardware variance on the learned representation under our approach." This suggests that a linear transformation technique is used to adjust for bias introduced by hardware variance.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query regarding techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, it does mention a linear transformation technique used to adjust for bias introduced by hardware variance.
