Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the specific cloud platform or local system used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the use of the Mask-RCNN algorithm for image analysis of soil bacterial communities, and the successful application of this method in laboratory incubations and in situ field experiments. However, it does not mention any details about the computational platform used for the deep learning model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
