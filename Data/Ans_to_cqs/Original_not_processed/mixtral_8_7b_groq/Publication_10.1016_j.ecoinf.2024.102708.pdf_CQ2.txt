Answer:::

The deep learning models used in the study for mapping the density of wild Pacific oysters utilize drone imagery as their data format. Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in this specific context processes image data.

In the study, two object detection models, YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, were employed. These models were used to identify and categorize Pacific oysters in the drone images. Additionally, three variants of the YOLOv5 model were tested, including YOLOv5 small, YOLOv5 medium, and TPH-YOLOv5, which is a modified version of YOLO with a Transformer Prediction Head.

To provide more context, drone imagery is a popular data format in remote sensing applications of deep learning, particularly for object detection and image segmentation tasks. Drones can capture high-resolution images of the target area, which can then be processed using deep learning algorithms to extract valuable information. In this case, the drone imagery was used to detect and quantify the density of Pacific oysters, contributing to the management of their expansion into protected areas.
