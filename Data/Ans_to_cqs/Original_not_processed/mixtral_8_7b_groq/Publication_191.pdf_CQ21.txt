Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the computation of top-1 classification accuracy in the validation set for the deconvolutional network.

In the context of deep learning models, postprocessing steps often include evaluating the performance of the model using various metrics, generating visualizations such as saliency maps, and creating confusion matrices.

Metrics calculation is an essential step in evaluating the performance of a model. Commonly used metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC). These metrics provide insights into how well the model is performing and can help identify areas for improvement.

Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the regions of the input that have the most significant impact on the model's output. These maps can provide insights into the model's decision-making process and can be useful for identifying biases or weaknesses in the model.

A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model. It compares the predicted labels with the actual labels and provides information on the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This information can be used to calculate various metrics and gain insights into the model's performance.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention these postprocessing steps, it is common practice to evaluate the performance of deep learning models using metrics calculation, generating visualizations such as saliency maps, and creating confusion matrices.
