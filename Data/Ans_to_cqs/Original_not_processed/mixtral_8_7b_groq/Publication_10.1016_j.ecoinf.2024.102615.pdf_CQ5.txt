The provided pieces of context do not specify any particular datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for predicting total phosphorus concentration in rivers or for the other studies mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide the specific datasets used in those studies.

However, the context does mention the application of deep learning techniques in agriculture by Attri et al. (2023) and the use of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model for predicting soil Mn content by Bashir et al. (2024). But neither of these studies mentions any specific datasets used in their deep learning pipelines.

In general, the choice of dataset depends on the specific problem being addressed, and there are many datasets available for use in deep learning, including MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet, and many others. MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits, CIFAR is a dataset of natural images, and ImageNet is a large-scale dataset of images with annotated labels. These datasets are commonly used for training and testing deep learning models for image classification, object detection, and other computer vision tasks.

Therefore, while I cannot provide the specific datasets used in the studies mentioned in the context, I can say that the choice of dataset depends on the specific problem being addressed, and there are many datasets available for use in deep learning, including MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet, and many others.
