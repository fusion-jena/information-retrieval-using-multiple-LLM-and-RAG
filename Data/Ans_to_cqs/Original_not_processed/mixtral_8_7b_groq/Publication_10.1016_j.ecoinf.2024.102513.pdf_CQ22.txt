Answer:::
The two metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model for land use and land cover (LULC) classification on the Kerch Peninsula are Overall Accuracy and the Kappa Coefficient.

The Overall Accuracy is a percentage that measures the proportion of pixels correctly classified out of the total number of pixels in the image. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of correct classifications (Ncorrect) to the total number of pixels (Ntotal) and multiplied by 100.

The Kappa Coefficient, on the other hand, takes into account the chance agreement between classification and observations. It determines how much the classification accuracy exceeds random agreement. The Kappa Coefficient is calculated as the ratio of agreed pixels (Po) to the total number of pixels, and the expected probability of agreement (Pe), which is calculated as the product of the sum of class proportions by rows and columns.

These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of the LULC classification on the Kerch Peninsula by comparing the classified data with ground observations. The use of these metrics allows determining the degree of correspondence between the classification results and the actual characteristics of the area, as well as evaluating the quality of the conducted work.

It is important to note that the deep learning model's performance was evaluated using a neural network trained on spectral indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Green-Red Vegetation Index (GRVI), Built-up Index (BU), and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). These spectral indices were calculated using various bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as Near-Infrared (Nir), Red, Shortwave Infrared (SWIR), and Green. The training process was conducted using a dataset divided into training, testing, and validation sets in a ratio of 70:20:10, respectively.
