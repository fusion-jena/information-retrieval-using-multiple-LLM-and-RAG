Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the IUC-NN model. However, it is mentioned that the IUC-NN model is implemented based on the Python TensorFlow library, which supports various optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), and others. Therefore, it can be inferred that these optimization techniques could potentially be used in the IUC-NN model. It is recommended to refer to the IUCNN package or the supporting information for specific details on the optimization techniques used.
