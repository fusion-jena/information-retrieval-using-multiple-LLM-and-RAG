Answer: The type of deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, the models used are DenseNet201, InceptionResNetv2, ResNet50v2, and EfficientNetB0 and B3. These models are all CNN-based architectures that have been used and compared in the study to find the most accurate model for the task. CNNs are a popular choice for image-related tasks due to their ability to effectively extract features from images. The use of CNNs in this study is appropriate as the task involves analyzing and enhancing images for further examination.
