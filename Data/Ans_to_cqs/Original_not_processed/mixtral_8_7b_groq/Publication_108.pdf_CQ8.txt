Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on describing the architecture of the deep learning model, its encoding and decoding paths, and the advantages of using this specific model for remote sensing applications. However, it does not mention where the code for this pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information about the location of the code repository.
