Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, the text does mention some image processing techniques that were used on remote sensing data. These techniques include de-clouding, mosaicking, and cropping. Additionally, the study used Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands of 30-m resolution, and calculated topographic variables from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) using the System for Automated Geoscientific Analysis (SAGA) GIS.

In the context of deep learning, data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used to increase the size of the training dataset and prevent overfitting. These techniques create new training examples by applying random transformations to the original images. For example, flipping horizontally or vertically creates a mirrored image, rotating creates a rotated image, and scaling changes the size of the image.

Without more specific information from the text, it is not possible to say for certain which data augmentation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general practices in deep learning, it is likely that some combination of flipping, rotating, and scaling was used to augment the remote sensing data.
