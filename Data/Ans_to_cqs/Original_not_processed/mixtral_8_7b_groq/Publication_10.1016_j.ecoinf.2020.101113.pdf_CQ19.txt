The text does not provide specific information about the deep learning framework used to build the model. However, it does mention that the model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and that they used the ResNet50 architecture. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch have support for CNNs and ResNet50, so it's possible that either of these frameworks were used. Without further information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
