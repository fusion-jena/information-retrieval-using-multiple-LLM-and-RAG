The provided context does not contain information about deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The context focuses on forest biomass density, spatial distribution, and total biomass, based on different forest types and inventories.

However, in general, deep learning pipelines may employ various strategies to handle randomness, such as:

1. Fixed random seed value: To ensure reproducibility, a fixed random seed value can be set at the beginning of the deep learning pipeline. This ensures that random operations, such as data shuffling or weight initialization, produce the same results in different runs.

2. Data augmentation: Random transformations, such as rotation, scaling, or flipping, can be applied to the training dataset to increase its size and introduce randomness. This helps the model generalize better and reduces overfitting.

3. Dropout: During training, dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of neuron outputs to zero. This helps prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons.

4. Batch normalization: This technique normalizes the activations of the previous layer for each mini-batch, introducing randomness by using different mini-batches.

5. Early stopping: This strategy involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training. If the performance stops improving or starts degrading, training can be stopped early, preventing overfitting and reducing the impact of randomness in the later stages of training.

6. Ensemble methods: Combining multiple models trained with different random initializations or data splits can help reduce the impact of randomness and improve overall performance.

These strategies are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to handle randomness, but the provided context does not contain specific details about their application in the given forest biomass density analysis.
