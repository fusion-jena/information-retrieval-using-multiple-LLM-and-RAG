Answer:::
The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the pre-trained weights of ResNet50-v2 and MobileNet-v2 are from ImageNet, which suggests that ImageNet may have been used in the pipeline. ImageNet is a large-scale dataset consisting of over 14 million images belonging to 21,841 categories, making it a popular choice for training and testing deep learning models, particularly for image classification tasks.

Additionally, it is mentioned that the data collected for this study includes images of different species, and the training set was balanced by upsampling the images from the underrepresented classes to match the number of images of the most represented class, "No species". Therefore, it can be inferred that the dataset used in this study is specific to this research and is not a standard dataset like MNIST or CIFAR.

In summary, while the specific dataset used in this deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that it is a dataset of images of different species, and the models were pre-trained on ImageNet.
