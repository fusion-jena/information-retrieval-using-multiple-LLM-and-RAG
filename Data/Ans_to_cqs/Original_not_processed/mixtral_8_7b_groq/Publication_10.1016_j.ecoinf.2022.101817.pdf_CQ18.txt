Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it is mentioned that five different CNN models (Model 2 to Model 6) were trained and their performance was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, and average true/false positives/negatives. These metrics were calculated on the validation frames, suggesting that cross-validation was used to assess the models' performance. Cross-validation is a common strategy to monitor model performance during training, as it provides an estimate of how the model generalizes to unseen data. Furthermore, a confusion matrix was generated for each model, which is another technique to evaluate the performance of a classification model. The best CNN model, Model 5, was selected based on accuracy, and its confusion matrix was used in the next phase of the proposed pipeline. Therefore, while the specific monitoring strategy is not mentioned, cross-validation and confusion matrix generation were used to evaluate the models' performance.
