Answer:::
In the context provided, there are several preprocessing steps mentioned before training a deep learning model, specifically for plant cover estimation. However, the preprocessing steps do not include typical steps such as normalization or scaling of the pixel values. Instead, the preprocessing focuses on generating weak segmentation maps from a classification network using class activation mapping. 

First, a classification network is trained using GBIF image data, which applies class activation mapping to generate weak segmentation maps (Korschens et al., 2021b). Class activation mapping is a technique that provides a coarse localization map of the object in the image, highlighting the important regions for the classification task (Zhou et al., 2016). These weak segmentation maps are then used for training a segmentation network on the GBIF image data in the second phase. 

In this phase, the network is trained with the mean scaled absolute error as the regression loss, using a batch size of 1, an input image resolution of 5, and an image size of 1536 Ã— 768 pixels. The learning rate used is 10, and only horizontal flipping is utilized for data augmentation in this phase. 

It is important to note that these preprocessing steps are specific to the problem of plant cover estimation and may not generalize to other tasks or datasets. For other tasks, typical preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, and cleaning of the data might be necessary. Normalization, for example, can help to bring the data into a similar range, making it easier for the network to learn. Scaling can help to reduce the effect of outliers, and cleaning can help to remove noise or irrelevant information from the data.

In summary, the preprocessing steps mentioned in the context provided include training a classification network and generating weak segmentation maps using class activation mapping. These maps are then used for training a segmentation network. However, typical preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, and cleaning are not mentioned in this context.
