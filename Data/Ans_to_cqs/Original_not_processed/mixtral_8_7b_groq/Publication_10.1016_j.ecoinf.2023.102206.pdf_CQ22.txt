The pieces of context provided do not directly mention the specific evaluation metrics used for the deep learning models. However, they do mention the use of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as a metric for evaluating the performance of the IFTL refinement approach when applied to GRNN, SVR, and ELM models.

In the context, RMSE is used to measure the difference between the actual and predicted GDP values using only CO2 emission data. The IFTL refinement approach is reported to have improved the prediction accuracy over traditional ELM and FTL models, as indicated by the percentage reduction in RMSE.

However, for deep learning models in general, there are several evaluation metrics that can be used, depending on the specific problem and the nature of the data. Some of the commonly used metrics for evaluating deep learning models include:

1. Accuracy: It is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions made. It is a commonly used metric for classification problems.
2. Precision: It is the ratio of the number of true positives (correctly predicted positive instances) to the total number of predicted positives. It is a useful metric for imbalanced datasets.
3. Recall: It is the ratio of the number of true positives to the total number of actual positives. It is a useful metric for cases where identifying all positive instances is important.
4. F1-score: It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and provides a balanced measure of both.
5. Mean Squared Error (MSE): It is the average of the squared differences between the actual and predicted values. It is a commonly used metric for regression problems.
6. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): It is the square root of the MSE, and provides a measure of the standard deviation of the prediction errors.
7. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): It is the average of the absolute differences between the actual and predicted values. It is a useful metric for measuring the magnitude of the errors.
8. R-squared: It is the coefficient of determination, and measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

Therefore, depending on the specific problem and the nature of the data, any of these metrics or a combination of them can be used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models.
