Answer:::

The data was split into three sets for training, validation, and testing in the proportions 80 : 10 : 10. This means that 80% of the total 426,876 images were used for training the deep learning model, 10% were used for validation, and the remaining 10% were used for testing. This is a common practice in machine learning to ensure that the model is able to generalize well to unseen data. The training set was further augmented with various image transformations such as horizontal and vertical flipping, adjustments in brightness, saturation, contrast, and hue. This was done to increase the robustness of the classifier and reduce overfitting. The validation set was used to tune the hyperparameters of the model during training, while the test set was used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model.
