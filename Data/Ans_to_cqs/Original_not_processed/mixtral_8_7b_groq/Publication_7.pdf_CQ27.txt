Answer:::

The text provided gives some information about how the deep learning model was trained, but it does not give explicit details about how the trained model was deployed. However, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized and then implemented on a computer vision and deep learning based framework for the automatic annotation of marine images.

First, the model was trained using a pre-trained VGGnet, which is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN). The weights of this deep network were fine-tuned using the Benthoz15 dataset, which consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. The activation vectors of the first fully connected layer of the pre-trained VGGnet were employed as feature representations.

After training, the model was likely serialized, which means that the trained model was saved to a file so that it could be loaded and used later. This is a common practice in deep learning, as it allows trained models to be easily shared and reused.

Next, the serialized model was implemented on a computer vision and deep learning based framework for the automatic annotation of marine images. The text does not provide specific details about the platform selection or the implementation, but it does mention that the goal of the research is to develop advanced deep learning and computer vision based models for automatic annotation of imagery from coral reefs.

In summary, while the text does not provide explicit details about the deployment of the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized and then implemented on a computer vision and deep learning based framework for the automatic annotation of marine images.
