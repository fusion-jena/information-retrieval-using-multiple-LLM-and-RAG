The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for wetland classification in this study are not explicitly named in the provided context, unlike standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, the context does mention that the deep learning model was trained on remote sensing data. Specifically, it was trained on a combination of spectral bands, topographic indices, and vegetation indices (ARI, Band 2, Band 3, Band 4, DEM, NDVI, NDWI, PSRI, REIP, TPI, TRI, TWI, VBF, VH). These inputs were chosen because they help optimize the deep learning model for this specific task. Therefore, the dataset used in this study is a custom dataset of remote sensing data, rather than one of the standard datasets commonly used in deep learning research.
