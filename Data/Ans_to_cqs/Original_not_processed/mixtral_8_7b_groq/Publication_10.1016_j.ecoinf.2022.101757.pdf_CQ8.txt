Answer:::

The code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study by L. Martinez-Sanchez et al. is available on GitHub. The specific implementation of DeeplabV3+ with conditional random fields (CRF) used in this study can be found in the repository at <https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf>. This repository contains the code for the deep learning pipeline used to infer semantic segmentation masks from landscape photos, as well as the pre-trained weights obtained from training the model on the COCO dataset. The COCO dataset is a widely used dataset for training computer vision models and sets a baseline for benchmarking their performance. It consists of 121,408 images and a total of 883,331 object annotations divided into 184 classes. In this study, the deep learning pipeline was used to derive common objects below the skyline without training the model directly on the landscape photos.
