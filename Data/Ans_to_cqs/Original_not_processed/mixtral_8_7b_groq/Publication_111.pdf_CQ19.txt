Answer:::
The text does not explicitly mention which framework was used to build the deep learning model. However, it is stated that the models were implemented in the Python programming language version 3.8.5. Popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch have Python interfaces, so it is possible that one of these was used. Additionally, the GRU-DNN model implementation is performed using a hidden layer of GRU cells, which is a type of recurrent neural network. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch have support for implementing GRU cells. Without more specific information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
