Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include the learning rate and the optimizer. The learning rate determines the size of the steps that the model takes while moving toward a minimum of the loss function. A high learning rate may cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, while a low learning rate may result in slow convergence. The optimizer is a method that the model uses to update the weights and biases in response to the gradient of the loss function. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), adaptive moment estimation (Adam), and root mean square propagation (RMSprop). The choice of optimizer and learning rate can significantly impact the performance of the deep learning model. Other hyperparameters include the mini-batch size, the number of epochs, and the regularization techniques used. The mini-batch size is the number of training examples used in each update of the model weights and biases. The number of epochs is the number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset. Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. The values of these hyperparameters are typically determined through a process of trial and error, based on the performance of the model on a validation dataset. The specific hyperparameters used in the training stages described in the context are not provided, but they likely include the learning rate, optimizer, mini-batch size, number of epochs, and regularization techniques.
