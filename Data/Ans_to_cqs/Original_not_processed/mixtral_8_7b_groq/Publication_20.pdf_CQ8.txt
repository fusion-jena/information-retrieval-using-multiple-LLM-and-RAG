Unfortunately, the context provided does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. There is a mention of a link to a depository with architecture details at the end of the references, but it is not specified whether this link contains the code or not. Additionally, the references provided do not include any links to a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the code repository based on the given context.
