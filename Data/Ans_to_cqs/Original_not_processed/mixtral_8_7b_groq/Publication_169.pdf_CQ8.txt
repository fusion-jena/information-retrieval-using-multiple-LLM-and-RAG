Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used to classify plant species. The text focuses on the methodology, results, and prior research related to the development of a deep CNN-LSTM model for plant species identification. It includes details about the model's architecture, training process, and performance evaluation. However, there is no mention of where the code for this pipeline is available, such as on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

To find the code repository, you may consider contacting the authors of the paper or looking for it on their affiliated institutions' websites or research groups' pages. Additionally, you can search for the paper's title or the authors' names on popular code-sharing platforms to see if they have made the code publicly available.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. You may need to contact the authors or search popular code-sharing platforms to find it.
