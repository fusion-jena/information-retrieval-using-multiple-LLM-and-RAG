Answer:

The pieces of context provided do not explicitly mention the datasets used in the deep learning pipelines for plant species classification. However, they do give some insights into the image sources and the types of images used in the studies.

In the study proposed by Azadnia et al. (2022), the input images are RGB plant images, but the specific dataset is not mentioned. Bambil et al. (2020) used color learning resources for plant species identification, but the dataset is not specified. Similarly, in the study by Gao et al. (2021), the input images are leaf images, but the dataset is not provided.

In the Indian medicinal plant dataset context, there is no mention of a specific dataset used for deep learning approaches. However, it can be inferred that the images of Indian medicinal plants are used for classification tasks in the studies by Barhate et al. (2023), Ganguly et al. (2022), and Chulif et al. (2023).

Therefore, it can be said that the datasets used in the deep learning pipelines for plant species classification in the provided context are not explicitly mentioned. The studies use RGB plant images, leaf images, and images of Indian medicinal plants, but the specific datasets are not disclosed.
