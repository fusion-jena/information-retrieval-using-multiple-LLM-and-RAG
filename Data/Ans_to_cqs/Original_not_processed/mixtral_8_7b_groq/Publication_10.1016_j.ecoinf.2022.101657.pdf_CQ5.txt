Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipelines for camera trap data. However, it does mention some studies that use deep learning techniques for processing camera trap data.

The study by Schindler and Steinhage (2021) uses a combination of Mask R-CNN with Flow-Guided Feature Aggregation to optimize instance segmentation of animal species in video clips obtained from camera traps. The study by Wang et al. (2021) introduces Scaled-YOLOv4, a deep learning-based object detection model that can be used for detecting animals in camera trap images.

In general, deep learning models for image and video analysis are often pre-trained on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet, COCO, or KITTI. These datasets contain a diverse set of images and annotations that help the models learn features and patterns that can be useful for a wide range of tasks. Once pre-trained, these models can be fine-tuned on specific datasets, such as camera trap data, to improve their performance for the task at hand.

In the context of camera trap data, it is important to have diverse and representative datasets that cover the range of species and environments that the models will encounter in the wild. Creating such datasets can be challenging, as it requires careful planning, data collection, and annotation. Recent studies have started to address this challenge by developing tools and methods for filtering, labeling, and processing camera trap data (Wei et al., 2020; Xi et al., 2021).
