Answer: Based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is an image. The study focuses on developing a deep-learning classifier for change detection in remote sensing images. The input images are of size 32 by 32 pixels, which are cropped to different sizes (1 × 1, 4 × 4, 8 × 8, and the original 32 × 32) to account for objects represented as a single pixel up to larger assemblages extending beyond the input image. Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in this study is specifically designed for image data.
