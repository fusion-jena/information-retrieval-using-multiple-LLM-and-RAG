Answer:::

The deep learning model in the study by Gong et al. (2023) is built using the TensorFlow framework. This is evident in the configuration table provided in the study, which lists TensorFlow as one of the components in the data processing section. The table also mentions Python 2.7 and OpenCV as other components of the data processing system, but it is TensorFlow that is specifically identified as a deep learning framework.

It is worth noting that the study uses a hybrid approach to deep learning, combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a Transformer model. The CNN is used as a backbone to extract features from input data, while the Transformer model is used to model global attention using those features. The specific CNN used in the study is ResNet, which is a widely-used CNN architecture in computer vision tasks.

While the study does not explicitly mention other deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, it is possible that the authors used additional tools or libraries to implement the hybrid CNN-Transformer model. However, based on the information provided in the study, it is clear that TensorFlow is the primary deep learning framework used in the study.
