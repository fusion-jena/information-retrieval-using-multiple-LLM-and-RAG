Answer:::
The data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context is images. More specifically, the input to the deep learning algorithm is low-resolution pictures of bugs from the Triatominae family. These pictures are then converted into numerical 'features' using the Inovtaxon software, which extracts 226 features representing color, shape, and texture attributes of the pictures. These feature vectors are then used as input to train the deep learning algorithm. Therefore, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is a feature vector extracted from images.
