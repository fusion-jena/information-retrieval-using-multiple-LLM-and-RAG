The provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning models. However, it does mention that batch normalization (BN) is employed to prevent vanishing or exploding gradients in deep CNNs, which implies that some form of gradient descent optimizer is being used.

The context also mentions that GoogLeNet uses auxiliary classifiers to accelerate network convergence, and ResNet addresses the degradation problem by using shallow layers and identity mapping for network construction. These are architectural hyperparameters that have been chosen to improve the performance of the models.

The deep learning models used in the study are VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet. Each of these models has their own set of default hyperparameters, which can be adjusted during training. For example, in VGG16, the learning rate is set to 0.01 by default, and it uses stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a momentum of 0.9 as the optimizer. In ResNet50, the learning rate is set to 0.1 by default, and it uses SGD with a momentum of 0.9 and a weight decay of 0.0001. In AlexNet, the learning rate is set to 0.01 by default, and it uses SGD with a momentum of 0.9.

It is possible that the authors of the study have adjusted these hyperparameters from their default values in order to optimize the performance of the models for their specific task. However, the context does not provide information on whether or how the hyperparameters were adjusted.
