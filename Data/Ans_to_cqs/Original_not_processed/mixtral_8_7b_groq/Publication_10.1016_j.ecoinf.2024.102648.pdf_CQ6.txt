Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model for predicting Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD) incidence. However, it can be inferred that the weather data used for the analysis was recorded from 2011 to 2019 at weather stations based at all four locations. This data was used for calculating the Growing Degree Days (GDD) using specific equations. Therefore, it can be assumed that the data preprocessing might have involved steps such as:

1. Data Cleaning: This step involves handling missing or inconsistent data points. In this case, it can be assumed that the weather data was checked for missing or inconsistent values, and appropriate measures were taken to handle them.

2. Data Scaling: Since the deep learning model used in this study is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), it is likely that the data was scaled to ensure that all the input features had similar ranges. This is important because ANN models can be sensitive to the scale of the input features. The scaling could have been done using techniques such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization.

However, the context does not provide explicit information about these preprocessing steps. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
