Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, we can infer some information about the dataset used in the study from Table 9.

The study compares the performance of the proposed HPB3C-3PGA-based approach with existing transfer learning approaches using the CVIP100 dataset for plant leaf classification. The CVIP100 dataset contains 100 classes of plant leaf images, with a total of 75,000 images. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets, with 60,000 images for training, 7,500 images for validation, and 7,500 images for testing.

However, the context does not mention whether the dataset was split in a stratified manner, which would ensure that each class is represented proportionally in each subset. Stratified sampling can help prevent bias and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Additionally, the context does not mention whether cross-validation was used to evaluate the model's performance. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on one fold, and testing it on another fold. This process is repeated for each fold, and the results are averaged to provide a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

Therefore, while the study uses a diverse dataset for plant leaf classification, it is unclear whether additional measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
