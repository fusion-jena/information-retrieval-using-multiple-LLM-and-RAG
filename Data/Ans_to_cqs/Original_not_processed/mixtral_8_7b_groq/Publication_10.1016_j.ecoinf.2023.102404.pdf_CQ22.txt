The text provided does not give information about a deep learning model or the metrics used to evaluate its performance. Instead, it discusses a machine learning model, specifically an ensemble of decision trees, and the parameters tuned to optimize its performance. The metrics used to evaluate this model's performance are mean bias error (MBE), root mean square error (RMSE), and R2. These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of the model's predictions in estimating shrub willow biomass from UAS imagery.

Answer:::
The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are not specified in the provided text. Instead, the text focuses on a machine learning model and evaluates its performance using MBE, RMSE, and R2. These metrics are used to assess the accuracy of the model's predictions in estimating shrub willow biomass from UAS imagery.
