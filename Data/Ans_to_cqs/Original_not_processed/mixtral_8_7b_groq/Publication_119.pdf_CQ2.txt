Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline described in the context involves the use of image data format. The specific image data used is from WorldView-3 (WV-3) imagery. The U-Net model, which is implemented within arcgis.learn, is used for the labeling of each pixel in the training data. This model is pretrained on ImageNet, which is a large-scale image recognition dataset, and it has a ResNet-50 backbone. The model takes WV-3 imagery as input and produces an end-to-end classification map by segmenting and classifying each pixel in the input image. The training data derived from ground data collection is in the form of image data. The quantity of training data derived from ground data collection in 2018 was limited, but implementing a U-Net model within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python removed the requirement for a quantitatively massive dataset. Additionally, the U-Net implemented through arcgis.learn is pretrained on ImageNet to further improve classification accuracies. Therefore, the deep learning pipeline described in the context uses image data format.
