Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. However, it is important to note that the research focuses on algal blooms forecasting in the Zhoushan fishery using hybrid deep learning models with satellite data. Therefore, the data repository might be different from the ones typically used for life sciences data (such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF).

Given the nature of the study, the data repository could be an Earth sciences or remote sensing data center. A few possibilities include:

1. NASA's Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PODAAC): This data center provides in situ and satellite oceanographic data, including remote sensing products that could be used for studying algal blooms.

2. NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI): This organization is responsible for preserving and providing access to various types of environmental data, including oceanographic and remote sensing data.

3. The European Space Agency (ESA) data centers: ESA operates several data centers that provide access to Earth observation data, which could be used for studying algal blooms in the Zhoushan fishery.

4. The data could also be hosted on the Zhejiang Ocean University's own servers or data repositories, given that the authors are affiliated with the Marine Science and Technology College at the university.

To find the exact data repository, it would be necessary to contact the authors or look for additional information in the related publications or project websites.
