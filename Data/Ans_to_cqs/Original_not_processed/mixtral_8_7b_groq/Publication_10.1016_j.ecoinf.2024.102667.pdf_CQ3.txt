The provided context does not include information about the data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, it focuses on the data sources and methods used in a specific research study related to land use/cover, climate change, and ecological engineering in China.

In this study, the authors used various data sources, including land use/cover datasets from the Resource and Environmental Science Data Center (RESDC) and the National Ecological Science Data Center, as well as meteorological data from 2472 national-level meteorological stations in mainland China. These data were used to analyze the trends and impacts of land use/cover changes, climate change, and ecological engineering on the environment.

The land use/cover dataset from RESDC has a spatial resolution of 1 km × 1 km and covers the years 1980 to 2018, with six major categories and twenty-six subcategories. The dataset was created through a combination of manual and automated interpretation and on-site data validation, achieving high accuracy for the primary and secondary categories. The authors reclassified the land use/cover types into six categories: cultivated land, forestland, grassland, construction land, water area, and unused land.

The meteorological data from the national-level meteorological stations were processed using the thin plate spline interpolation technique of ANUSPLIN to produce gridded precipitation and air temperature data with a resolution of 1 km × 1 km. The radiation data, with a resolution of 1 km × 1 km, is an 8-day composite dataset of net land surface radiation provided by Junbang (2021). The mean air temperature, overall precipitation, and mean net land surface radiation were computed for the growing season of every year (March to October).

Therefore, while the context provides valuable information about the data sources and methods used in a specific research study, it does not directly answer the query about data annotation techniques in deep learning pipelines.
