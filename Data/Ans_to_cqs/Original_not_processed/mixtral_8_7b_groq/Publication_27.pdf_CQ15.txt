Answer:::

In the context provided, there are several optimization techniques mentioned that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Here are some of them:

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): This is a simple optimization algorithm used in deep learning to minimize the loss function. It works by iteratively adjusting the weights in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function.
2. Adam: This is an optimization algorithm that is an extension of SGD. It stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation. Adam uses the past gradients to adjust the learning rate, making it adaptive to the problem at hand. It has been shown to perform well in many deep learning applications.
3. RMSprop: This is another optimization algorithm that is an extension of SGD. It stands for Root Mean Square Propagation. RMSprop uses a moving average of the squared gradients to adjust the learning rate, making it adaptive to the problem at hand.
4. Adagrad: This is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate to the parameters of the model. It works well for sparse data and has been used in natural language processing applications.
5. Adadelta: This is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate based on the historical gradient. It is an extension of Adagrad and has been shown to perform well in deep learning applications.
6. Adagrad+Adadelta: This is a combination of Adagrad and Adadelta optimization algorithms. It has been shown to perform well in deep learning applications, especially for training recurrent neural networks.

In summary, there are several optimization techniques that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, including SGD, Adam, RMSprop, Adagrad, Adadelta, and Adagrad+Adadelta. These algorithms are used to minimize the loss function and adjust the learning rate to improve the performance of the model.
