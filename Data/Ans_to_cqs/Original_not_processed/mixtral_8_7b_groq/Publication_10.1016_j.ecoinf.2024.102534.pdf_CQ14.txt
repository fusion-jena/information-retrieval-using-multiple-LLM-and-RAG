Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model used in the study are optimized. The text does not mention any specific techniques such as grid search, random search, or others that are commonly used for hyperparameter tuning.

The article focuses on the application of ensemble models for predicting the suitable areas for orchids in New Guinea under current and future climate change scenarios. It provides details about the data used, the evaluation metrics, and the classification threshold, but it does not discuss the hyperparameter optimization process.

Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
