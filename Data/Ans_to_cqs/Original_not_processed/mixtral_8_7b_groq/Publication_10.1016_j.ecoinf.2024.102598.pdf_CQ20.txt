The provided context does not give information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The text focuses on the evaluation of five MLMs (machine learning models) and does not mention any deep learning models or the hardware used for training them.

The MLMs evaluated are Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART). The evaluation is based on their performance in predicting forest fire pixels using training AUC (Area Under the Curve) and TSS (True Skill Statistics) scores.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query about the hardware resources used for training deep learning models.
