Answer: The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), specifically the DeepLabV3+ algorithm. This is mentioned in the second piece of context, which states that "DeepLabV3+ is a CNN algorithm for semantic segmentation." CNNs are a type of neural network that are particularly good at processing grid-like data, such as images, by using convolutional layers to filter and extract features from the input data. The DeepLabV3+ algorithm is the latest version of the DeepLab algorithms family and is used for semantic segmentation, which is the process of dividing an image into multiple segments to classify each pixel based on its features. The algorithm introduces dilated convolutions in the encoding stage to expand the receptive field without losing information and uses an Atrous spatial pyramid pooling module with dilated convolution to incorporate multi-scale information. During decoding, it enhances the accuracy of segmentation boundaries by further integrating low-level features with high-level features.
