The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the model is a spectral-spatial paralleled convolutional neural network (SSPCNN) that integrates 1-D CNN and 2-D CNN to extract features from hyperspectral images (HSI) for forest species classification.

It is common to use powerful hardware such as GPUs or TPUs for training deep learning models due to their computational requirements. GPUs are particularly well-suited for parallel processing tasks, making them ideal for training deep learning models. However, the specific hardware resources used in this case are not mentioned in the provided context.
