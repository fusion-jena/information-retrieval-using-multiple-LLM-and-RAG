Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a few databases and repositories related to the studies discussed.

The study on "Assessing soil organic carbon stock of Wisconsin, USA and its fate under future land use and climate change" retrieved a set of 2207 SOCS (Soil Organic Carbon Stocks) from a database, but the database is not named in the context. Similarly, the study on "A dataset of carbon density in Chinese terrestrial ecosystems (2010s)" created a dataset, but the repository for this dataset is also not specified.

Moreover, the context mentions some data repositories like GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) and Zenodo, but these are not directly linked to the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query. However, it is possible that the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is mentioned in the full studies or papers, which are not provided in the context.
