Answer:

The provided context discusses the use of various machine learning algorithms for water quality prediction, but it does not mention any specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to directly answer the query about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline (e.g., SGD, Adam).

However, it is important to note that deep learning algorithms typically require careful optimization of hyperparameters and learning rates to ensure good performance. Some common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), and others like RMSprop, Adagrad, and Adadelta. These optimization techniques are used to minimize the loss function and update the model's parameters during training.

In the context provided, the researchers considered deep learning algorithms for water quality prediction but decided not to use them due to the limited number of samples. They instead focused on tree-based ensemble learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, GBDT, LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost. These algorithms do not directly involve the optimization techniques mentioned in the query, as they are primarily used for deep learning models.
