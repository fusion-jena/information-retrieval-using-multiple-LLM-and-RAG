Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The text focuses on the use of sampling techniques to address the problem of unbalanced training data in the context of land use classification.

However, we can infer some possible measures that might have been taken based on common practices in machine learning:

1. Diverse dataset: The paper mentions the use of different experimental groups (EXP1 to EXP10) with varying tile sizes, which suggests that the dataset likely includes a variety of land use types and spatial scales. This diversity can help improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
2. Cross-validation: Although not explicitly mentioned, cross-validation is a standard technique for assessing the performance and generalizability of machine learning models. It involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on one subset, and evaluating its performance on the remaining subsets. Repeating this process with different subsets can provide a more reliable estimate of the model's generalizability.
3. Stratified splitting: In the context of imbalanced datasets, stratified splitting can be used to ensure that each subset contains a representative sample of each class. This can help prevent the model from being overfit to the majority class and improve its ability to generalize to new data.

It is important to note that these are inferred measures, and the actual steps taken to ensure the generalizability of the model are not specified in the provided context.
