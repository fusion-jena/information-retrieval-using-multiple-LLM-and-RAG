Answer:::
The specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models in the given context are not mentioned. However, based on the common practice and the compatibility with the mentioned libraries, it can be inferred that TensorFlow or Keras could be the possible frameworks used.

In the first piece of context, the paper "Sensors 2021, 21, 343" discusses several CNN architectures, including customized ones, ResNetV50, and InceptionNetV3. The training and evaluation of these models are performed using the Adam optimizer and the SGD optimizer. Both of these optimizers are compatible with TensorFlow and Keras, which are popular deep learning frameworks.

Furthermore, in the second piece of context, the paper compares customized CNN architectures with selected state-of-the-art CNN optimized architectures, such as EfficientNetB0 and DenseNet121. These architectures are also compatible with TensorFlow and Keras frameworks.

In the absence of explicit information about the deep learning framework, it is reasonable to assume that the authors have used TensorFlow or Keras, given their popularity and compatibility with the mentioned optimizers and architectures.
