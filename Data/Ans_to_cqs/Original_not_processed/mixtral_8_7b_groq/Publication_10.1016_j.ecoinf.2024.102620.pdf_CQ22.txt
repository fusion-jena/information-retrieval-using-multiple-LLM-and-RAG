The provided context discusses the evaluation metrics for a land use change model, namely the Pearson correlation coefficient (R), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). However, it does not directly mention the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall.

The Pearson correlation coefficient (R) measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables, which can be used to evaluate the correlation between predicted and actual values in a regression problem. However, accuracy, precision, and recall are commonly used metrics for evaluating the performance of a deep learning model, especially in classification problems.

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions. Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot directly answer the query regarding the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model. However, it is important to note that the choice of evaluation metric depends on the specific problem and the nature of the data. For a deep learning model, accuracy, precision, and recall are commonly used metrics, but other metrics such as F1 score, area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), and Cohen's kappa coefficient can also be used depending on the problem at hand.
