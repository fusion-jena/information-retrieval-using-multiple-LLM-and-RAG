Answer:::

The context does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, it does offer details about the specific hyperparameters used in the training of the Vision Transformer (ViT) models for birdsong classification.

The authors used the Adam optimizer with a concatenating cosine-annealing linear scheduler. The initial learning rate was 0.0001, which decayed by a factor of 0.001 times the learning rate. The batch size was 32. For validation, a 5-fold cross-validation was utilized. To handle class imbalance, a data set sampler was employed, which involved upsampling and duplicating randomly selected samples and augmenting them. The models were trained for 50 epochs without mixing up augmentations and for 100 epochs with mixing up augmentations. Early stopping was introduced to prevent overfitting when no further improvement was observed.

However, the context does not mention any systematic approach to hyperparameter optimization like grid search or random search. These methods involve training the model with different combinations of hyperparameters and selecting the best combination based on performance. It's possible that the authors used a different method for hyperparameter optimization, or they might have used fixed hyperparameters based on previous research or experimentation. Without further information, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer.
