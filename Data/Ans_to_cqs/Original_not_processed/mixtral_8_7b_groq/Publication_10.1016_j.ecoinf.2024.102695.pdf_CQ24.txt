Answer:::
In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of specific strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, some details are given about the data splitting strategy and the use of early stopping, which can indirectly help manage randomness.

To begin with, the dataset is divided chronologically into training, validation, and test sets, consisting of 70%, 10%, and 20% of the data, respectively. This allocation strategy ensures that the data in the validation and test sets differ from the training set data, thereby enhancing the generalizability of the model. Although this method does not directly address randomness, it helps create more diverse and independent sets, which can contribute to the robustness of the model.

Another technique mentioned is early stopping. During the training process, if the model's performance on the validation set does not improve for a certain number of epochs, the training is stopped early. This strategy helps prevent overfitting, which is related to randomness since overfitting can make the model too sensitive to the specific training data.

While not explicitly stated in the context, deep learning practitioners often use random seed values to ensure the reproducibility of their experiments. By setting a fixed random seed value, the random initialization of weights and biases, data shuffling, and other random processes become deterministic. This allows researchers to reproduce their results and compare different models fairly.

In summary, although the context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does discuss data splitting and early stopping strategies that can contribute to the model's robustness and generalizability. Additionally, it is common practice in deep learning to use a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility.
