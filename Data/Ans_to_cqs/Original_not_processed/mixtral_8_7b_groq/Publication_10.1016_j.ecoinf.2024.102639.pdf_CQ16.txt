Answer:::
The context provided does not explicitly mention the specific criterion used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention the use of cross-validation and grid search in training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. These techniques are often used to prevent overfitting and to tune model hyperparameters for better generalization, but they can also be used to monitor training progress. For instance, in the context of SVM, one could monitor the cross-validation error to check if it has plateaued, indicating that the model has likely converged and further training may not significantly improve it. Additionally, the F-measure, accuracy, precision, and recall percentages provided could also be used to assess model performance and determine when training is complete. However, the specific stopping criterion is not mentioned in the context.
