Based on the provided context, there are specific postprocessing steps mentioned after the model training, which include determining misclassified images, randomly interchanging a portion of those images between the training and validation sets, and retraining the model. However, there is no explicit mention of techniques such as saliency maps or confusion matrix calculation. Here's a detailed breakdown of the described postprocessing steps:

1. Test the validation dataset and determine the misclassified images: After training the Inception-ResNet-v2 architecture on data-augmented images, the model's performance is evaluated on the validation dataset. The images that are incorrectly classified by the model are identified at this stage.

2. Randomly interchange the same amount of misclassified validation images with the training images and retrain the model again: A certain number of misclassified images from the validation set are randomly selected and swapped with an equal number of images from the training set. This process introduces new information to the model, helping it adapt to the specific target task and potentially reducing overfitting.

3. Repeat this process until the classifier adapts to the specific target task: The model is retrained with the modified training and validation sets, and the process is repeated until the model demonstrates satisfactory performance on the validation dataset.

4. Fit the model to evaluate the test set: After the model has been retrained and adapted to the target task, it is then evaluated on the test dataset to assess its generalizability.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques like saliency maps or confusion matrix calculation, these methods can still be used in conjunction with the described postprocessing steps to provide additional insights into the model's performance. Saliency maps can help visualize the regions of the input images that the model focuses on, while a confusion matrix can offer a comprehensive view of the model's classification accuracy across different classes.
