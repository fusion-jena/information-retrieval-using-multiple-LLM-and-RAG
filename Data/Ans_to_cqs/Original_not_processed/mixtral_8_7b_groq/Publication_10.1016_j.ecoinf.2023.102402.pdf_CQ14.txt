Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the Maxent models were optimized. The text mentions that the best model was chosen based on the lowest AICc value, and that all models with a Î”AICc value less than 2 have substantial support. However, it does not specify the method used for hyperparameter optimization.

Hyperparameter optimization is an important step in the process of building a machine learning model, as it can significantly impact the model's performance. There are various methods for hyperparameter optimization, including grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves systematically trying all possible combinations of hyperparameters, while random search involves randomly selecting hyperparameters to try. Bayesian optimization involves using a probabilistic model to guide the search for the best hyperparameters.

It is possible that the authors of the study used one of these methods for hyperparameter optimization, but the text does not provide enough information to determine this. It is also possible that they used a different method or did not perform hyperparameter optimization at all.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized.
