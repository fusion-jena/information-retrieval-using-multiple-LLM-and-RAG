The provided context does not include information about the deployment of a trained deep learning model. It mainly discusses the data acquisition and processing of tweets for biodiversity observations. However, it does mention the use of the twarc2 library to handle the data in JSON format returned by the Twitter API. This library simplifies handling quota limits and pagination, but it does not provide details about model serialization or platform selection for deploying a trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
