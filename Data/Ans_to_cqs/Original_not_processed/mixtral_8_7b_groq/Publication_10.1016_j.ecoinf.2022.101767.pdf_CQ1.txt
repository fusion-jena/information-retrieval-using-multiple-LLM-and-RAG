The provided context does not directly discuss the deep learning pipeline or the methods used for collecting raw data in such a pipeline. However, it does mention some methods used for collecting data related to ecosystem services and wild bird species, which can be somewhat relevant to the query.

In the context of ecosystem services, the paper by Small et al. (2017) mentions that data on ecosystem services can be collected using methods that reflect more of the benefit from ecosystems than those based on questionnaires, surveys, or interviews. While the paper does not specify what these methods are, it suggests that they may involve more objective and quantifiable measures of ecosystem services.

In the context of wild bird species, the study by Tachibana et al. (2021) collected data on TV nature programs across the Japanese archipelago. The study analyzed the geographic distribution and number of TV nature programs that featured wild bird species. While this study did not use deep learning techniques, it did involve collecting and analyzing publicly available data on wild bird species.

The Catalog of Birds of Japan by the Ornithological Society of Japan (2000) is another example of a public dataset that provides information on wild bird species in Japan. This catalog could potentially be used as a raw dataset in a deep learning pipeline related to wild bird species.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss the deep learning pipeline or the methods used for collecting raw data in such a pipeline, it does mention some methods used for collecting data related to ecosystem services and wild bird species. These methods include more objective and quantifiable measures of ecosystem services, as well as the collection and analysis of publicly available data on wild bird species.
