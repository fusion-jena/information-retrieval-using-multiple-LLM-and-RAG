Answer:::

The provided context does not contain specific information about the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does mention the use of deep learning tools such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and cuDNN for machine learning applications, including image and audio classification.

In general, data splitting for deep learning model training involves dividing the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. This process is crucial for evaluating the performance and generalization ability of the model.

1. Training set: This is the primary dataset used to train the model. The model learns patterns from this data, adjusting its parameters to minimize the error or loss function.
2. Validation set: This dataset is used during the training phase to validate the model's performance and tune hyperparameters. The validation set helps to prevent overfitting by providing an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data.
3. Testing set: After training and validating the model, the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance on unseen data. This set should be independent of both the training and validation sets.

The criteria used to split the data can vary depending on the specific application and dataset size. Common methods include:

1. Random splitting: The data is randomly divided into the three subsets with a predefined ratio (e.g., 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% testing).
2. Time-series splitting: For time-series data, the data is split based on time, using the earliest data for training, the middle portion for validation, and the latest data for testing.
3. Stratified splitting: When dealing with imbalanced classes, stratified sampling ensures that each subset contains a representative proportion of samples from each class.
4. K-fold cross-validation: This method involves dividing the data into 'k' folds, where each fold is used as the validation set once, and the remaining 'k-1' folds are used for training. The process is repeated 'k' times, and the average performance is calculated.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training, it is a standard practice in deep learning to divide the data into training, validation, and testing subsets. The criteria used for splitting can vary depending on the specific application and dataset.
