Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about how raw data is collected in the deep learning pipeline for the specific systems or methods mentioned. However, it can be inferred that some of the systems use audio files as input, which suggests that the data was collected using audio recording devices or extracted from existing audio datasets.

For instance, the "Template matching" and "Yang et al. (2021)" systems seem to use annotated audio events, which implies that the audio data was collected through recordings and then manually annotated. Similarly, the "Mel +PCEN" and "CNN" systems likely use audio data as well, although the context does not explicitly mention the data collection process for these methods.

In the context of machine learning systems, raw data can be collected through various means, such as:

1. Surveys: Participants can be asked to provide data through questionnaires or interviews.
2. Sensors: Devices like microphones, cameras, or accelerometers can be used to collect data in real-time.
3. Public datasets: Researchers can use publicly available datasets, which have been collected and processed by other researchers or organizations.

Given that the context focuses on audio-based systems for event detection, it is plausible that the raw data was collected using audio recording devices or extracted from existing audio datasets. However, the specific data collection methods for the mentioned systems are not provided in the context.
