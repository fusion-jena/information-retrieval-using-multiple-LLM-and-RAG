Answer:::
The postprocessing steps involved after the model training, as described in the provided context, include the evaluation of the ResNet50 model on three test datasets: Google Image Search, Portuguese Flora, and iNaturalist. The accuracy results are reported in terms of Top1 and Top5 accuracies. A comparison is made between the ResNet50 model's performance and the PlantNet tool's performance on these same three datasets.

Additionally, the ResNet50 model's accuracy values are put into perspective by highlighting that, when trained with the same image dataset, the ResNet architecture outperforms the most widespread online public plant classification algorithm by around a factor of 2 in top1 and top5 accuracies.

However, the provided context does not explicitly mention other postprocessing steps such as generating saliency maps, calculating other metrics, or creating a confusion matrix. Therefore, based on the given information, it can be concluded that the postprocessing steps primarily involve comparing the ResNet50 model's performance with other classification tools on external test datasets.
