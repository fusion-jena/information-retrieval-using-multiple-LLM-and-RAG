Answer:

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the creation of training samples and the use of the Google Earth Pro application programming interface (API) for further analysis. Specifically, 1800 sample points were randomly generated in the image of the study area for each year, with 300 sample points for each land cover type. These samples were then randomly divided into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio. The random forest algorithm was applied to rapidly classify the land use types in the study area.

Additionally, post-classification processing was applied to the images, and a manual visual interpretation approach was used to correct the image classification results for mangroves within a 10-km buffer zone extending inland from the coastline. This procedure effectively corrected misclassifications between forest and mangroves resulting from "spectral confusion".

It is important to note that the user's accuracy and total accuracy were monitored throughout the training process. For instance, in the year 2000, the user's accuracy for mangrove forest was 87.02%, while the total accuracy was 85.63%. The Kappa coefficient, which measures the agreement between the predicted and actual values, was 0.853. These performance metrics were used to evaluate the accuracy of the model and make improvements as needed.

However, the text does not provide specific details about how the model performance was monitored during the training phase. Therefore, it can be inferred that the monitoring strategy involved a combination of training sample creation, image classification, and performance metric calculation.
