Answer:::
In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some common regularization techniques that are frequently used in deep learning.

Regularization is a crucial approach to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. It helps to reduce the complexity of models and improve their generalization ability. Here are two common regularization techniques:

1. Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero during training. This prevents the model from relying too much on specific input features and encourages the model to learn more robust features. The dropout rate, which is the fraction of input units to be dropped, is a hyperparameter that can be tuned for better performance.

2. L2 Regularization: L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the squared magnitude of the model's weights. This penalty term discourages large weight values, which can lead to overfitting. By adding this term, the model is encouraged to distribute the weights more evenly, reducing the risk of overfitting.

These regularization techniques can be applied to various deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). In the context of object detection models like YOLOv5, regularization methods can help to improve the model's ability to generalize to new data and prevent overfitting to the training data.

Therefore, while the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods, it is important to consider regularization techniques when developing deep learning models to prevent overfitting and improve their performance.
