Answer:::
The specific type of deep learning model used in the study mentioned is not explicitly specified in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the models are likely to be some form of supervised learning model, as they are compared to a Na√Øve Bayes classifier and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), which are both supervised and unsupervised learning methods, respectively.

The study uses GPS track data to predict the diving locations of birds monitored with only GPS devices. The models are constructed in R using the H2O package, which is a general-purpose machine learning platform that supports various deep learning algorithms such as Neural Networks, Deep Water, and Gradient Boosting Machines.

Therefore, while the specific type of deep learning model used is not explicitly stated, it is likely to be a Neural Network or a similar model supported by the H2O package.
