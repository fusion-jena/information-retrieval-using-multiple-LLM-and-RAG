Answer:::

In the context provided, the preprocessing steps mentioned before training a deep learning model include denoising, contrast enhancement, and image resizing. However, only image resizing was specifically applied in the study.

Image resizing is a common preprocessing step to adjust the input image resolution to match the model's input requirements. Denoising and contrast enhancement are other techniques used to improve image quality and remove unwanted noise. Normalization and scaling are also common preprocessing steps to standardize the input data's range and distribution, which can help the model converge faster and improve its performance.

Normalization typically involves scaling the input data's values to a specific range, often between 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. Scaling can be achieved by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the input data.

Cleaning refers to removing outliers, missing values, or irrelevant information from the input data. In the context of image data, cleaning might involve removing irrelevant images or fixing corrupted images.

Therefore, based on the provided context and general deep learning practices, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model can include denoising, contrast enhancement, image resizing, normalization, scaling, and cleaning.
