Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning for image processing of herbarium sheets but does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of transfer learning and data augmentation, which can help reduce data bias to some extent.

Transfer learning involves initializing the model weights with pre-trained weights from a large dataset (such as ImageNet) and fine-tuning them on the smaller herbarium scan dataset. This can help reduce data bias as the pre-trained weights provide a good starting point and can help the model learn more generalizable features.

Data augmentation involves creating new synthetic samples from the existing dataset by applying random transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping. This can help increase the size of the dataset, provide more variability, and reduce overfitting. Data augmentation can also help reduce data bias by creating synthetic samples from underrepresented classes.

Other techniques that can be used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This involves splitting the dataset into training and testing sets while ensuring that the distribution of classes is similar in both sets. This can help ensure that the model is tested on a representative sample of the data.
2. Oversampling: This involves increasing the number of samples in the underrepresented classes to balance the dataset. This can help ensure that the model is trained on a balanced dataset and does not learn to favor the majority class.
3. Undersampling: This involves reducing the number of samples in the majority class to balance the dataset. This can help reduce the computational cost and memory requirements of the model but may result in loss of information.
4. Diverse data collection: This involves collecting data from multiple sources or domains to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help reduce data bias and improve the generalizability of the model.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it does mention transfer learning and data augmentation, which can help reduce data bias to some extent. Other techniques that can be used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
