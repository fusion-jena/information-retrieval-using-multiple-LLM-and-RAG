Answer:::

The criteria used to split data for deep learning model training typically include a train set, a validation set, and a test set. However, the specific proportions can vary depending on the context and the requirements of the project.

In the context of the first article, "Attributes on social followings using social media data and deep learning," no specific details are provided about the data splitting criteria. Therefore, we cannot directly answer this query based on this article alone.

However, in general, the train set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model performance. The splitting criteria can be based on different factors, such as time, randomness, or specific events.

For instance, in the second article, "Improving audit opinion prediction accuracy using metaheuristics-tuned XGBoost algorithm with interpretable results through SHAP value analysis," the authors used a 70-30 split for training and testing, respectively. They did not explicitly mention a validation set, but it can be inferred that they might have used cross-validation techniques during the model tuning phase.

In the context of deep learning models for image processing, such as the HRNet model used in the third article, "Crowdsourcing the perceived urban built environment via social media: the case of underutilized land," the data splitting criteria can be based on the number of images or the spatial distribution of the images. For example, the authors could have split the data based on different cities or regions to ensure that the model is generalizable across various urban settings.

In summary, while the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not provided in the first article, in general, the train, validation, and test sets are used for training, tuning, and testing the model, respectively. The splitting criteria can vary depending on the context and the requirements of the project.
