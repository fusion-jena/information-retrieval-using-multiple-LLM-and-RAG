Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning techniques for image classification, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. However, it does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning techniques, there are several regularization methods commonly used to prevent overfitting, including dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization technique that involves randomly dropping out, or setting to zero, a proportion of the neurons in a layer during training. This helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons and promoting the learning of more robust features.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, involves adding a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which can help to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.

These regularization techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines and can be applied to a variety of image classification tasks, including the ones discussed in the provided context. However, the specific regularization methods used in the studies mentioned in the context are not specified.

Another technique mentioned in the context is data augmentation, which involves artificially increasing the size of the training set by applying various transformations to the existing images. While data augmentation is not a regularization technique per se, it can help to prevent overfitting by providing the model with a more diverse set of training examples.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that techniques such as dropout and L2 regularization were used. These techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines and can help to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model and promoting the learning of more robust features.
