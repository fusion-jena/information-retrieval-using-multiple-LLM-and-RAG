Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is available. However, it is mentioned that STARdbi's raw and processed data will be made available to the entomological community and the general public, which suggests that there will be a data repository for this information.

The pipeline includes high-resolution scanning of sticky traps with insects, uploading the scanned images and metadata to the STARdbi database using its web interface, and automatic detection of insects in the images with storage of their position in the database. Once stored and processed, the images as well as bounding boxes around the detected insects are available for users.

It is also mentioned that STARdbi will urge its users to make their data as open as possible, starting by raising this issue here. This indicates that STARdbi values data sharing and availability.

Therefore, while the specific repository for the data is not mentioned, it can be inferred that STARdbi has plans to make the data available in a repository, potentially one of the commonly used ones such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, further information would be needed to provide a definitive answer.
