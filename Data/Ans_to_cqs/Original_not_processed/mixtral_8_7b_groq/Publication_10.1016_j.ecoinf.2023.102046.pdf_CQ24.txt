Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, there are some details about the training process that can give us some insight into how randomness might be handled.

First, the authors mention that they used a batch size of 16 examples for training the models. While the specific batch sampling strategy is not specified, it is common to use random sampling to select the examples for each batch. This introduces some randomness into the training process, as different examples are selected for each batch.

Second, the authors mention that they used the AdamW optimizer for Hugging Face models and the Adam optimizer for Inception-V3. Both of these optimizers use a form of adaptive learning rate, which can help to reduce the impact of randomness on training by adjusting the learning rate based on the gradients of the loss function.

Third, the authors mention that they used a learning rate of 1e-5 for ViT and a learning rate of 4e-4 for Deep Otolith ResNet. The choice of learning rate can also affect the impact of randomness on training, as a higher learning rate can make the training process more unstable, while a lower learning rate can make it more stable.

Finally, the authors mention that they used data augmentation techniques such as random horizontal flipping and random rotation for the Inception-V3 model. Data augmentation can introduce some randomness into the training process by creating new examples based on random transformations of the original examples.

Overall, while the context does not provide explicit details about strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest that the authors used techniques such as random batch sampling, adaptive learning rate optimization, and data augmentation that can help to reduce the impact of randomness on training. However, the specific use of a random seed value to control randomness is not mentioned.
