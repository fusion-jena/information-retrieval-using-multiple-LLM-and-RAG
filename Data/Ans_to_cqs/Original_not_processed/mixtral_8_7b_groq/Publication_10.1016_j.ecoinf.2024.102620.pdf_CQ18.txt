Answer:

The text provided does not give a specific strategy for monitoring the model performance during training. However, it does offer some insights into how the model's performance could be evaluated.

The PLUS model, which is a significant part of the context, seems to use the random forest algorithm for obtaining the development probabilities of each land use type. This is compared to the FLUS model, which uses an artificial neural network (ANN). The text suggests that the PLUS model's approach is superior, but it does not provide any specifics about how the models' performances are compared or monitored during training.

In the context of the CASA model, the focus is on calculating the Net Primary Productivity (NPP) using light energy utilization efficiency. The model's performance could potentially be evaluated by comparing the calculated NPP values with actual measurements. However, the text does not explicitly mention any strategy for monitoring the model's performance during training.

The text does provide some general criteria for evaluating model performance. For instance, it mentions that values between 0.2 and 0.5 for certain parameters indicate acceptable accuracy, while values above 0.5 indicate incorrect predictions. These criteria could be used to assess the model's performance after training.

In conclusion, while the text provides some information about the models and their performance evaluation, it does not explicitly mention a strategy for monitoring the model performance during training.
