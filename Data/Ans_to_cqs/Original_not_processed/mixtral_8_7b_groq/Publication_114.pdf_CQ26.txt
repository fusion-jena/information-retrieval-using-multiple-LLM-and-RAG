Answer:::

In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation to increase the amount of tree species samples for training of the deep learning network. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of the training dataset by applying transformations such as rotation, mirroring, and flipping to the existing data. This can help to improve the model's ability to generalize and reduce overfitting.

In addition, the context also mentions the use of benchmark datasets for training and testing of deep learning approaches in remote sensing fields. These benchmark datasets are likely to be diverse and well-balanced, which can help to reduce data bias.

As for the techniques you mentioned, Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are all techniques used to address data imbalance, which is a type of data bias. Stratified splitting is a method of splitting a dataset into training and testing sets, in which the distribution of labels is maintained in both sets. Oversampling and undersampling are methods of balancing a dataset by either duplicating samples from the minority class (oversampling) or removing samples from the majority class (undersampling).

Diverse data collection is a method of collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population. This can help to reduce data bias by ensuring that the training data is representative of the data the model will encounter in the real world.

In summary, while the context provided does not explicitly mention the techniques you asked about, it does mention the use of data augmentation and benchmark datasets to improve the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are all techniques that can be used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
