Answer:::

The study titled "From meteorological to agricultural drought: Propagation time and influencing factors over diverse underlying surfaces based on CNN-LSTM model" appears to have taken several measures to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, even though the specific techniques used are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

Firstly, the compilation of a comprehensive dataset, which encompassed various influencing factors and an extensive drought propagation time series spanning from January 1950 to December 2
