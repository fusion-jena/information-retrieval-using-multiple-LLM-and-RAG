The provided context discusses the methodology for training and validating machine learning models, specifically CART, RF, GTB, and SVM, within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. However, it does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.

Deep learning models are a subset of machine learning models that typically require larger datasets and more complex training procedures compared to the traditional machine learning models mentioned in the context. Deep learning models often use a combination of techniques to split and prepare data for training, such as:

1. Random sampling: This method involves randomly splitting the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. This approach helps ensure that the data used for training, validating, and testing the model are representative of the entire dataset.

2. Stratified sampling: In this method, the dataset is split based on predefined categories or classes. This ensures that each subset (training, validation, or test) contains a representative sample of each class in the dataset. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

3. K-fold cross-validation: This technique involves dividing the dataset into 'k' subsets or folds. The model is then trained on 'k-1' folds while one fold is reserved for validation. This process is repeated 'k' times, with each fold serving as the validation set once. The average performance across all 'k' iterations is then calculated to evaluate the model's performance.

4. Time-series split: When dealing with time-series data, it is essential to ensure that the training, validation, and test sets are chronologically separated. This prevents the model from having access to future data during training.

Based on the provided context, the dataset has been split into training and testing sets using a stratified sampling approach, with 70% of the samples used for training and the remaining 30% for testing. However, the context does not mention any validation set or criteria used for splitting the data for deep learning model training.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. Deep learning models typically use random sampling, stratified sampling, k-fold cross-validation, or time-series split for data preparation.
