Answer:::

 I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the performance comparison of different ResNet architectures for underwater video analysis and the methodology of a study designed to identify coralligenous species using deep CNN architectures. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested link.
