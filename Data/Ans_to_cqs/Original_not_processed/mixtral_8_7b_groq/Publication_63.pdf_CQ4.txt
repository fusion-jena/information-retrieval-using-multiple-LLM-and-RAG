Answer:::

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as described in the given context, include horizontal and vertical flipping, adjusting contrast, saturation, and brightness, and clipping pixel values. Specifically, the images of the training data were subjected to horizontal and vertical flipping. Additionally, the contrast, saturation, and brightness of the images were adjusted by factors ranging from 0.9 to 1.1. After these adjustments, the pixel values were clipped to a range between 0 and 1 to prevent the value range from being enlarged.

It is important to note that the context does not mention other common data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, or translation. Therefore, it can be concluded that these techniques were not applied in the described deep learning pipeline.

Data augmentation is a powerful technique used to increase the robustness and transferability of model predictions by inflating the amount of training data and helping the CNN learn spatial features independent of the data acquisition. In this case, the image augmentation procedure served to assist the CNN in learning spatial features independent of camera settings.

In summary, the data augmentation techniques applied in the described deep learning pipeline include horizontal and vertical flipping, adjusting contrast, saturation, and brightness, and clipping pixel values. Other common data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, or translation were not mentioned in the given context.
