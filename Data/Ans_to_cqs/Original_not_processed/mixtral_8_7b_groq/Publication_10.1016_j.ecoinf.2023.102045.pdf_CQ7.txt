Based on the provided context, there is no information about the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context focuses on color gamut, color palettes, and scientific communication, particularly in the context of ecological informatics, computational ecology, and mapping. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query using the given pieces of context.
