Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training of the Wav2Vec model. The text focuses on the pre-processing, pre-training, and fine-tuning phases of the Wav2Vec model. However, it is common practice to calculate various metrics, create confusion matrices, and generate saliency maps as part of the postprocessing steps in machine learning models.

Metrics calculation usually involves measuring the performance of the model using various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and perplexity. These metrics provide insights into how well the model is performing and help identify any potential issues or biases.

A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It compares the actual labels of the data with the predicted labels and provides a visual representation of the model's performance. The confusion matrix can be used to calculate various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Saliency maps are a way to visualize the importance of each input feature in the model's prediction. They highlight the parts of the input that the model considers most important for its prediction. Saliency maps can be useful for understanding how the model is making its predictions and for identifying any potential issues or biases.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training of the Wav2Vec model, it is common practice to calculate various metrics, create confusion matrices, and generate saliency maps as part of the postprocessing steps in machine learning models.
