Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions an article related to the use of Sentinel-2 data for wetland analysis, but it does not provide specific details about the data augmentation methods used in the deep learning pipeline.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to use data augmentation techniques to increase the size of the training dataset and improve model generalization. Some of the most commonly used data augmentation techniques for image data include:

1. Flipping: This involves flipping the image horizontally or vertically to create new training examples.
2. Rotation: This involves rotating the image by a certain angle to create new training examples.
3. Scaling: This involves scaling the image up or down to create new training examples.
4. Translation: This involves shifting the image horizontally or vertically to create new training examples.
5. Color jittering: This involves changing the brightness, contrast, or saturation of the image to create new training examples.

Therefore, while there is no specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the provided context, it is likely that some of these common techniques were used to augment the Sentinel-2 data.
