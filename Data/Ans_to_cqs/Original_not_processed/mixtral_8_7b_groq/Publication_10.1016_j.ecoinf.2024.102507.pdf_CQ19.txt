Answer:::
The Keras framework is used to build the deep learning model, with mathematical functions constructed in TensorFlow. This information is provided in step 2 of the first piece of context, which states: "Build the model: Use Keras to build mathematical functions in TensorFlow." While the specific framework is not explicitly mentioned in the text, Keras is a well-known high-level neural networks API, frequently used with TensorFlow as its backend. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that TensorFlow is the framework utilized for building the deep learning model in this case. PyTorch is not mentioned in the provided context.
