The provided context does not give information about the deep learning pipeline or the methods used for collecting raw data in that pipeline. However, it does provide information about the data sources and types used in a study of ecosystem services in the Weihe River Basin.

The data sources for this study include a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), land use data, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, soil data, population data, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data, meteorological data, and statistical yearbooks. These data are primarily raster or statistical in nature, with spatial resolutions ranging from 30 meters to 1 kilometer. Additionally, there is a vector data source.

While these data are not directly related to a deep learning pipeline, they do provide insight into the types of data that can be used in ecological studies. The data were likely collected using a variety of methods, such as remote sensing (for DEM, NDVI, and meteorological data), surveys or censuses (for population and GDP data), and possibly in-person measurements or observations (for land use and soil data). Public datasets, such as statistical yearbooks, may also have been used.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query about data collection methods in a deep learning pipeline, it does suggest that a variety of data sources and collection methods may be used in ecological studies, including remote sensing, surveys, censuses, and public datasets.
