Based on the provided context, the performance of the deep learning model was evaluated using the Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) approach. However, the context does not specify the exact metrics used to evaluate the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, or recall.

The LOOCV approach involves training the model on all but one observation from the dataset and then testing the model on the excluded observation. This process is repeated for each observation in the dataset, and the results are used to estimate the model's performance.

In the context provided, the model's performance was evaluated by comparing the GEDI L4A AGBD footprint values with AGBD estimated from Sentinel-2 models and by examining the relationship between tree height and AGBD for field data and GEDI data. These comparisons can provide insights into the model's ability to estimate AGBD accurately, but they do not explicitly quantify the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall.

Therefore, while we can infer that the model's performance was evaluated using the LOOCV approach and by comparing GEDI and Sentinel-2 data, the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.
