Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of a modified EfficientNetV2 network for object detection in benthic organism datasets and its improvements in training speed and accuracy, but it does not mention where the code can be found. Therefore, I am unable to provide the code repository link based on the given context.
