Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context mainly discusses a research article titled "Machine-learning aiding sustainable Indian Ocean tuna purse seine fishery" published in the Ecological Informatics journal. The article discusses the use of machine learning models such as Random Forest, SMO, Multilayer Perceptron, and Na√Øve Bayes for predicting the presence of four tuna species (SKJ, YFT, BET, and FAL) using environmental and oceanographic variables.

However, the context does not provide information on the data preprocessing steps, including data augmentation techniques, applied in the deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize. These techniques involve creating new synthetic samples by applying transformations to the existing data, such as horizontal flipping, rotating the images, or scaling the pixel values.

Therefore, without additional information, it is not possible to answer this query accurately.
