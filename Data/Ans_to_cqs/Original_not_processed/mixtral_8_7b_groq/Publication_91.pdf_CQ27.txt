The provided context discusses the training of a deep learning model for pollen species identification using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and multispectral imaging flow cytometry. However, it does not give information on the process followed to deploy the trained model.

The context does mention that the dataset consisted of 426,876 images, which were split into three sets for training, validation, and testing. It also mentions that data augmentation techniques were applied to the training set to improve the model's robustness and generalization. The model was trained with a batch size of 32, and the initial learning rate of 0.001 was exponentially decayed every 3 epochs with a factor of 0.94.

However, there is no information on how the trained model was serialized, the platform it was deployed on, or any other details about the deployment process. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer to the query based on the provided context.
