The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the use of a Random Forest (RF) model for predicting a certain variable. However, I can still provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the RF model.

To ensure the generalizability of the RF model, the researchers used 10-fold cross-validation, which is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model by dividing the dataset into k subsets or "folds" and training and testing the model k times, each time using a different fold as the test set and the remaining k-1 folds as the training set. This technique helps to reduce overfitting and provides a more reliable estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.

In addition, the researchers used independent test data to further verify the model's stability. This involved using a separate dataset that was not used in the training or cross-validation process to evaluate the model's performance. The results showed that the average R2 was 0.931 and the average RMSE was 141.124 ion/cm3, indicating that the RF model has high simulation accuracy and good stability.

Furthermore, the researchers used parameter optimization to select the most important variables for the RF model. This involved analyzing five training samples and obtaining their importance scores (VI) by simulation. The selected variables were then sorted according to their scores, and those with a score of more than 30% VI were considered to be of higher importance. This helped to ensure that the model was not overfitting to irrelevant or less important variables.

Overall, while the provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model, the researchers took several measures to ensure the generalizability of the RF model, including cross-validation, independent test data, and parameter optimization. These techniques are also commonly used in deep learning to ensure the generalizability of models.
