The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions various aspects of the model training process, such as the input image size, batch size, optimization algorithm, and learning rate, but it does not specify the type of hardware used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.
