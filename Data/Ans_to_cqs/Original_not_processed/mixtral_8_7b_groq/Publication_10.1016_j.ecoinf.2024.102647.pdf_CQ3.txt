The provided context does not contain specific information about data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. However, it does contain information about the application of deep learning models for soil salinity distribution mapping and groundwater salinity hazard mapping.

In the context of the study on soil salinity distribution mapping in Lake Urmia, Iran, an automated deep learning convolutional neural network algorithm was used. However, the specific data annotation techniques used in this study are not mentioned.

In the context of the study on groundwater salinity hazard mapping, four models were used, including two statistical models (frequency ratio (FR) and statistical index (SI)) and two machine learning models (Random Forest (RF) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART)). These models were trained and tested on groundwater salinity data, but the data annotation techniques used to prepare the data for these models are not specified.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines can include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and others. These techniques are used to label and categorize data, allowing deep learning models to learn patterns and relationships within the data.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing a box around an object of interest in an image, allowing the model to learn the spatial location and size of the object. Instance segmentation involves labeling each individual instance of an object in an image, allowing the model to learn the shape and appearance of the object. Semantic segmentation involves labeling entire regions of an image based on their semantic meaning, allowing the model to learn the context and relationships between objects.

In summary, while the provided context does not contain specific information about data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, it is mentioned that deep learning models have been applied for soil salinity distribution mapping and groundwater salinity hazard mapping. In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines can include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation, among others.
