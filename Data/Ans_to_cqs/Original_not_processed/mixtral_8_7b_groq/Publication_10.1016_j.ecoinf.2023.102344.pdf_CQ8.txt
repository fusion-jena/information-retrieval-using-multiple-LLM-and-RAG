Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the BivalveNet deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the description of the BivalveNet model, its architecture, and its performance in bivalve shell image analysis for geographical traceability. It mentions that the model is a hybrid deep neural network, consisting of a combination of LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM layers followed by a fully connected layer and a classification layer. However, it does not provide information about where the code for this model can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
