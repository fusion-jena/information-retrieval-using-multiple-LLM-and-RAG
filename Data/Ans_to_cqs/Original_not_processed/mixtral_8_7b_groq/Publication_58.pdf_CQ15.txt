Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in the study mentioned utilizes Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a momentum of 0.9 for training the neural networks. The learning rate starts at 10−2 and is divided by 10 every 20 epochs until it reaches 10−6. However, the specific optimization techniques such as Adam, RMSprop, or Adagrad are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

The study mainly focuses on comparing the performance of various deep learning architectures like ResNet, DenseNet, and DeepLab for land use (LU) detection tasks. It also discusses the impact of using central-pixel labeling and semantic labeling techniques on the performance of these models. The optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are kept relatively simple, relying on the classic SGD with a gradually decreasing learning rate.

Another architecture discussed in the context, AlexNet, does not provide specific details about the optimization techniques used during its training. It focuses on the architecture's design, including the number of kernels, layers, and activation functions.

In summary, the provided context discusses the deep learning pipeline primarily in terms of architectural choices and training strategies like learning rate scheduling. Specific optimization techniques such as Adam or RMSprop are not explicitly mentioned. The primary optimization technique used is Stochastic Gradient Descent with a decreasing learning rate.
