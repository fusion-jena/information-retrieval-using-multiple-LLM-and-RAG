Answer:

The provided context does not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that ecoacoustic surveying is used, and that passive acoustic recording equipment is used to collect audio data. However, it does not specify if any standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet are used. The pipeline is written in Python and uses Theano, Lasagne, and librosa for ML and audio processing, but it does not indicate any association with specific datasets. Therefore, I cannot provide the names of the datasets used in this deep learning pipeline.
