Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct information given about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the mentioned studies. The articles mainly focus on the methodology, implementation, and results of the deep learning models for fish biomass estimation and fish posture classification.

However, it is a common practice in research to share the code and data used in the study to ensure reproducibility and facilitate further research. Therefore, I would recommend checking the following places for the code repository link:

1. In the main text of the articles: Sometimes, authors provide a link to the code repository in the main text, usually in the Methods or Acknowledgments section.
2. In the supplementary materials: Some journals allow authors to provide supplementary materials, including code and data. You can check the supplementary materials of the articles to see if the code repository link is provided.
3. On the authors' personal websites or institutional repositories: Authors may share their code on their personal websites or institutional repositories. You can check the websites of the authors mentioned in the articles to see if the code is available.
4. On popular code-sharing platforms: Researchers often share their code on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. You can search for the authors' usernames or the project names on these platforms.

If you still cannot find the code repository link, you can consider contacting the authors directly to request the code. You can find their contact information in the articles.
