The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for the project in question. However, it can be inferred that synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data was used for the purpose of ocean object detection, specifically icebergs.

Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a type of radar system that is mounted on an aircraft or spacecraft and is used for remote sensing of the Earth's surface. SAR systems emit radar signals that are scattered back to the sensor by the Earth's surface, allowing for the creation of high-resolution images of the surface, even in adverse weather conditions.

Additionally, it can be inferred that the data used in this project was not obtained from public datasets, but rather created specifically for the project due to the lack of existing quality data. The data creation process involved the use of SAR imagery to create a dataset for training a deep learning model for ocean object detection.

In summary, while the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this project are not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data was used and that the data was created specifically for the project due to the lack of existing quality data.
