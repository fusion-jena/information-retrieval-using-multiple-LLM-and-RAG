Answer:

The text provided does not give explicit information about measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention some techniques that could indirectly contribute to the model's generalizability.

Firstly, the data resolution is kept consistent at 224x224 with RGB format, and inputs are batch normalized before training. This standardization of input data can help the model to generalize better.

Secondly, a batch size of 30 is used during training, which allows the model to learn from a variety of samples before updating the weights, potentially improving its ability to generalize.

Thirdly, an optimized rectified linear activation function, Leaky ReLU, is used in the models after the convolution or concatenate layer. This activation function can help to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, allowing the model to learn more effectively and potentially improving its ability to generalize.

Fourthly, the learning rate and dropout rate are set to the same value of 0.001, and bias value is 0. A lower learning rate can help the model to converge to a more generalizable solution, while the dropout technique can help to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out neurons during training.

Lastly, the number of training epochs is adjusted based on the depth of the neural network. This can help to prevent overfitting in shallower networks.

While these techniques can contribute to the model's generalizability, they do not explicitly address issues such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, it is unclear whether these measures were taken.
