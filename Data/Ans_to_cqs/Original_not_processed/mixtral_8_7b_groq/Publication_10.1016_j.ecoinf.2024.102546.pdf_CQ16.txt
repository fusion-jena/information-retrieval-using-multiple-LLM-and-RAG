Answer:::

The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context provided is not explicitly stated. However, there are several common methods used to determine training completion in machine learning models, such as validation loss plateau or reaching a predefined number of epochs. In this study, the authors used a learning rate schedule that combines warm-up and cosine decay for both YOLOX and YOLOv8 models. This learning rate schedule may implicitly control the training process by adjusting the learning rate during training, but it does not directly indicate when training is complete. Additionally, the authors did not mention any early stopping techniques based on validation loss or other metrics. Therefore, it can be inferred that the training of these models was likely completed after a predefined number of epochs or iterations, rather than based on a validation loss plateau.
