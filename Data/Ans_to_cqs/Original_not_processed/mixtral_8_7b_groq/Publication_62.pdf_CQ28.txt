The provided context does not include information about which platform, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, was used to deploy the deep learning model. The context focuses on the structure of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for identifying and differentiating plant specimens, as well as the detection of mercury-treated specimens. It includes descriptions of the Mathematica notebooks (Suppl. materials 1, 3, 2, 4) that contain the code used to define and train these CNNs. However, there is no information about the deployment platform for the deep learning model.
