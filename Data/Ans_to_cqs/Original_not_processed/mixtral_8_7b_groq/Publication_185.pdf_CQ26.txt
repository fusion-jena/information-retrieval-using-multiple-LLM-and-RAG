Answer:::

The text discusses the use of data resampling as a technique to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, it mentions the use of oversampling and undersampling to compare balanced data performance with imbalanced data.

Oversampling is a technique used to increase the number of instances of the minority class in the dataset, so that the classifier gets an equal number of instances from each class. Undersampling, on the other hand, is a technique used to decrease the number of instances of the majority class in the dataset, so that the classifier gets an equal number of instances from each class.

In the text, the authors used data resampling in training a new model, where the classes were evenly distributed. This was done to compare balanced data performance with imbalanced data. The results showed that the recognition rate for the family Hesperiidae increased, and the other rates have changed at the same time.

Additionally, the text also suggests that diverse data collection can be a technique to address data bias. The authors used images of six butterfly families to make their dataset because the image size and number are similar. The biological classification of these butterflies is recognized by taxonomists, so they can only use these known categories to make labels.

It is important to note that the experiments were performed on a small-size dataset without data augmentation. The authors suggest that it is feasible to use small dataset to train deep learning models as long as the parameters are chosen properly.
