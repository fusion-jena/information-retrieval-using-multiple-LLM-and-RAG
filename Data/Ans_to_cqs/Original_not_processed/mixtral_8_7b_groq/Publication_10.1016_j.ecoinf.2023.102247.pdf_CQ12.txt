Answer:::

The provided context does not mention the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the described pipeline. The models used in the study are regression-based (Generalized Linear Model) and machine-learning models, specifically Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The study also uses an ensemble modeling approach to combine the predictions of these models. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to identify a specific deep learning model used in the pipeline.
