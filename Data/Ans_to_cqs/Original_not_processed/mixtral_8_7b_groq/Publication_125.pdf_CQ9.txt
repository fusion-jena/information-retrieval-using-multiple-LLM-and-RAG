Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the description of a deep learning (DL) architecture for satellite image analysis and the proposal of a privacy-preserving approach based on PPDL (Private Personalized Deep Learning) for satellite images' data. However, it does not mention where the data repository is available. It is important to note that data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF are platforms to share and preserve data, but the specific repository for this DL pipeline is not provided in the context.
