Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are no specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning, particularly for image analysis, which might be relevant to the context of landscape photographs and 3D models.

Data augmentation is a strategy used to increase the diversity of training data by applying various transformations to the existing data. Some common data augmentation techniques include:

1. Flipping: This involves horizontally or vertically flipping the images, which can help the model generalize better and reduce overfitting.

2. Rotation: Rotating images at various angles can help the model learn invariance to rotation and better handle images taken at different angles.

3. Scaling: Changing the scale of images can help the model learn to recognize objects at different sizes.

4. Translation: Shifting images horizontally or vertically can help the model learn to recognize objects in different positions within the image.

5. Color jittering: Modifying the brightness, contrast, hue, or saturation of images can help the model learn to handle images with different lighting conditions.

While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is possible that they were used in the deep learning pipelines discussed in the papers. Nonetheless, the context does not provide sufficient information to determine the specific data augmentation techniques applied.
