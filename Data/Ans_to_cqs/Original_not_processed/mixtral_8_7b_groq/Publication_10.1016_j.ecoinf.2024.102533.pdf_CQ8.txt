I don't have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. The context provided consists of several ecological informatics papers and some numerical data, but there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository in GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other platform. If the authors of the papers have developed a deep learning pipeline, they may have provided a link to the code repository in the paper or associated materials, but I cannot access those materials to confirm. I would recommend reaching out to the authors or looking for additional information related to the deep learning pipeline specifically.
