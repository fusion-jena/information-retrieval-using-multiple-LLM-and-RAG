Answer:::

The provided context does not give a direct answer to the query as it does not mention any specific deep learning pipeline with a linked data repository. However, it does provide information on some pre-trained models and datasets used in natural language processing and text mining.

For instance, the Baroni word2vec model was trained on a 2.8-billion-word corpus, a concatenation of the ukWaC corpus, Wikipedia, and the British National Corpus. The model is available at <http://www.lingexp.uni-tuebingen.de/word2vec/word2vec.zip>. Although not a deep learning pipeline, it is a pre-trained model that can be used in deep learning applications.

Moreover, the context mentions the tm package for R, which is a text mining package for processing and analyzing text data. The package is available on CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, at <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=tm>.

Lastly, some studies mentioned in the context use Twitter data for their research. While not data repositories, Twitter provides APIs for accessing and collecting tweets for research purposes.

Therefore, while there is no direct answer to the query, the context provides some related resources that may be useful in deep learning pipelines.
