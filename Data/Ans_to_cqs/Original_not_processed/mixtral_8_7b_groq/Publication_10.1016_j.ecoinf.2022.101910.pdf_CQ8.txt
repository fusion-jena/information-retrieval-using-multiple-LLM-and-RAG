Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the code repository location for the deep learning pipeline used in BirdNET. BirdNET is a research project between The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Chemnitz University of Technology, which facilitates the automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations from sound recordings using a developed deep neural network.

However, it is mentioned that BirdNET is a user-friendly and ready-to-use machine learning approach, which suggests that the code might be accessible to the public. Considering that the project is a collaboration between two institutions, the code repository could be hosted on any of their respective websites or a collaborative platform.

To find the code repository, you could try the following steps:

1. Visit the websites of The Cornell Lab of Ornithology (<https://www.birds.cornell.edu/>) and the Chemnitz University of Technology (<https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/index.en.html>). Look for a section on research projects or collaborations and search for BirdNET.
2. Check the publications related to BirdNET. The context references several papers, such as Kahl et al., 2021; Wood et al., 2021; Arif et al., 2020; and Tolkova et al., 2021. You can look up these papers and contact the authors for information about the code repository.
3. Search for BirdNET on popular code repositories like GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket. It is possible that the code repository has been moved or is hosted on one of these platforms.

In summary, while the provided context does not give a direct answer to the query, you can try searching the websites of the collaborating institutions, contacting the authors of related publications, or looking on popular code repositories to find the BirdNET deep learning pipeline code repository.
