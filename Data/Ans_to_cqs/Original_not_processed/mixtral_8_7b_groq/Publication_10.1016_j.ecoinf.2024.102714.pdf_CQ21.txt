Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix after the model training. However, it does mention some post-classification refinement processes.

After the model training, the following post-classification refinement steps were taken:

1. Improvement of the classification for certain classes and areas: This required additional training data in areas known to be misclassified. This data was obtained through aerial photograph interpretation and targeted field visits.

2. Reclassification of the Vegetation Types (VTs): Following the acquisition of new training data, the VTs were reclassified.

3. Generation of the final nine-class VT map: After the reclassification of the VTs, the final map was generated.

Moreover, the context mentions the use of GMEP data for accuracy assessment, but it does not provide details about the methods used for this assessment. Common methods for accuracy assessment include the calculation of metrics such as overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, and the creation of a confusion matrix. However, these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, while the text does mention some post-classification refinement steps, it does not explicitly mention the specific postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix.
