Answer:::

The provided context does not give detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the deep learning models were constructed in R using H2O, and alternative prediction methods such as Na√Øve Bayes classifier and speed and tortuosity predictions were implemented for comparison. The models were used to predict the diving locations of birds monitored with only GPS devices.

Moreover, the context highlights the importance of coverage as an input in the models, particularly for razorbills. Coverage was calculated over a window of 10 possible points (1,000 s), and the window the model predicted dives in was 50 points (5,000 s). This indicates that there is some interaction between the coverage over a 10-point window within a larger time frame and seabird responses to environmental change.

However, the context does not explicitly mention any steps taken for model serialization or platform selection for deployment. Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model into a file, which can be used later for making predictions. Platform selection refers to choosing the appropriate hardware or software environment for deploying the model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot provide a complete answer to the query.
