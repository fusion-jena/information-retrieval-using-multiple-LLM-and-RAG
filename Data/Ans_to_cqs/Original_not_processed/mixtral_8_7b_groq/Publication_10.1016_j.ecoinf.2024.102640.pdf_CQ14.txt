Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the SegFormer model used in GreenCam are optimized. Hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in training machine learning models, and various methods such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and more can be used.

However, the context does provide information about the SegFormer model's performance on different categories in the UGE-D dataset. It mentions that the average IOU and pixel accuracy (PA) for tree, lawn, and shrub are 72.82% and 82.89%, respectively. But the performance on the facility category is relatively poor, which could be attributed to the limited annotations available for this category in the UGE-D. This information suggests that the model's performance has been evaluated, and it is possible that hyperparameter tuning has been performed to achieve these results.

Furthermore, the context also provides information about the architecture of the SegFormer model. It is a Transformer-based model that combines a Transformer-based encoder (MiT) with a lightweight decoder (ALL-MLP) composed entirely of multilayer perceptron (MLP) blocks. Knowing the architecture of the model can help in choosing appropriate hyperparameter tuning methods.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the SegFormer model are optimized, it is possible that hyperparameter tuning has been performed to achieve the model's performance on the UGE-D dataset. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
