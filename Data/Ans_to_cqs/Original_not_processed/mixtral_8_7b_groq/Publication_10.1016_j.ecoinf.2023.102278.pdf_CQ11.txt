Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. There are references to various papers and methods used in deep learning, such as the use of ResNet50 and EfficientNetB3 models in Gupta, D.A., Kalhagen, E.S., Olsen, Ã˜.L., Goodwin, M., 2022 and Gao, D., 2020, but there is no mention of a data repository link for the pipeline.

The context also mentions the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) in GBIF, 2022, but it is in relation to a different study on insect circadian activity. Therefore, it is not the data repository for the deep learning pipeline in question.

In conclusion, the provided context does not include the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
