Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The closest related reference is the paper by Kovalev et al. (2016) which compares different deep learning frameworks such as Theano, Torch, Caffe, Tensorflow, and deeplearning4j. However, the paper does not provide a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline.

It is possible that the authors have made their code available on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but they have not provided a link in the given paper. Therefore, it would be necessary to look up the authors' profiles or contact them directly to inquire about the code repository link.

Additionally, there are other resources available for deep learning pipelines. For instance, AWS kinesis and Apache Kibana provide access to state-of-the-art machine learning methods for event-stream processing. GStreamer is a pipeline-based multimedia framework that can be used for deep learning applications. Furthermore, there are various open-source deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras that provide code repositories for deep learning pipelines.

In summary, while there is no specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline provided in the given context, there are other resources available for deep learning pipelines. It would be necessary to look up the authors' profiles or contact them directly to inquire about the code repository link.
