Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of TensorFlow as the primary software framework for building deep learning models in the given study. TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google and is commonly used for implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The study utilizes TensorFlow to train and test CNN-based detectors, specifically GoogLeNet and ResNet-based models, for image processing tasks.

The authors mention that TensorFlow requires programming skills since it does not have a graphical user interface. They also explain how they used fine-tuning and data augmentation techniques during the training process to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. These techniques involve initializing the evaluated models with pre-trained weights from ImageNet and increasing the dataset size from 100 to 6000 images, respectively.

In summary, based on the given context, TensorFlow is the primary framework used for building deep learning models in this specific study. Other popular deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch, are not mentioned in the provided context.
