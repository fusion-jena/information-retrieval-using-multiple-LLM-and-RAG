Answer: The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given pieces of context are Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) and RGB images.

The pipeline begins with an unsupervised detection of trees using LIDAR data to generate initial training data for a self-supervised deep learning model (RGB). After this, the model is then retrained based on a small number of hand-annotated trees to create the full model.

Therefore, the data formats used in this pipeline are LIDAR and RGB images. LIDAR data is used for the unsupervised detection of trees, while RGB images are used for the self-supervised deep learning model.
