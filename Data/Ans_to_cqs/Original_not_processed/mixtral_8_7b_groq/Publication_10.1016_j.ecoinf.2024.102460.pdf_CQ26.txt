Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does discuss the use of deep learning models such as the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and Random Forest Classification (RFC) for predicting land-use changes and analyzing the drivers of land type conversion.

In the context of land-use change analysis, data bias can arise due to the uneven distribution of different land-use types in the study area. To address this issue, researchers can employ techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling during the data preprocessing stage.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into homogeneous subsets or strata based on the land-use types. This ensures that each subset contains a representative sample of each land-use type, thereby reducing data bias.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance the class distribution in the dataset. Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class, while undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class. These techniques can help improve the performance of deep learning models by reducing data bias and improving the model's ability to generalize.

Diverse data collection is another technique that can help reduce data bias in the deep learning pipeline. By collecting data from multiple sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the study area, researchers can reduce the risk of data bias and improve the model's ability to generalize.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, researchers can employ techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection to reduce data bias and improve the performance of deep learning models in land-use change analysis.
