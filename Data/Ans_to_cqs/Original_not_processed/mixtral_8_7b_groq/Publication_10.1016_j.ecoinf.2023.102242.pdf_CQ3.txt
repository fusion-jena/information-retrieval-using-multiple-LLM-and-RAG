The provided context does not contain specific information about data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. However, it does mention the use of object-oriented classification in remote sensing and forestry studies. In these studies, image objects are classified based on their features, but the specific methods of data annotation are not discussed.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a box around an object of interest in an image. The box defines the object's location and size, and the pixels within the box can be used as input data for training a deep learning model.

2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image according to the object it belongs to. This method provides more detailed information about the shape and location of objects than bounding box annotation.

3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling pixels in an image according to the category of object they belong to, without distinguishing between individual instances of the same category.

4. Classification: This technique involves assigning a label to an entire image or a region of interest within an image.

The choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the desired output of the deep learning model. For example, bounding box annotation may be sufficient for object detection tasks, while instance segmentation may be required for tasks that require detailed information about object shape and location.

In summary, while the provided context does not contain specific information about data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, techniques such as bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and classification are commonly used in deep learning applications.
