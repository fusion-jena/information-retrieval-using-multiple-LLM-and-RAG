Answer:::

The provided context includes a paper that mentions the use of data augmentation in the training of deep convolutional neural networks for environmental sound classification. Specifically, paper number 35 by Salamon and Bello (2016) mentions the use of data augmentation. However, the context does not provide specific details about the types of data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning include flipping, rotating, scaling, and adding noise. Flipping involves creating new training examples by horizontally flipping existing images or audio signals. Rotating involves rotating existing images or audio signals to create new training examples. Scaling involves changing the size of existing images or audio signals to create new training examples. Adding noise involves adding random noise to existing images or audio signals to create new training examples.

In the context of environmental sound classification, data augmentation techniques such as time stretching, pitch shifting, and adding background noise can be used to create new training examples. Time stretching involves changing the duration of audio signals to create new training examples. Pitch shifting involves changing the pitch of audio signals to create new training examples. Adding background noise involves adding environmental noise to audio signals to create new training examples.

Salamon and Bello (2016) mention that they used time stretching and pitch shifting as data augmentation techniques for environmental sound classification. They also mention that they used a data augmentation technique called "specaugment," which involves masking certain frequency bands and time frames in the audio signals.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give specific details about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, time stretching, pitch shifting, and adding background noise were used. Additionally, the use of specaugment as a data augmentation technique for environmental sound classification is also possible.
