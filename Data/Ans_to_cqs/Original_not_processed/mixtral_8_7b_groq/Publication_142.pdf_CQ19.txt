The text does not provide specific information about the deep learning framework used to build the model. It only mentions that the network is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data, but it does not specify the framework used for this process. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
