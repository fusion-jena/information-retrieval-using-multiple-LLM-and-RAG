The provided context does not include specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. The text focuses on the use of dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution to reduce computational load, as well as the introduction of a new LKSP module to improve object recognition in underwater images.

However, it is important to note that the choice of optimization technique can significantly impact the performance of a deep learning model. Common optimization techniques include:

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): A simple optimization algorithm that updates the model weights based on the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight.
2. Momentum: An optimization technique that incorporates the past gradients to smooth the updates and accelerate learning.
3. Adagrad: An optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradient information.
4. Adadelta: An extension of Adagrad that uses a running average of squared gradients to normalize the learning rate.
5. Adam: A popular optimization algorithm that combines the ideas from Adagrad and momentum, using running averages of both the gradients and the squared gradients to adapt the learning rate for each parameter.

These optimization techniques can be used in conjunction with the architectural optimizations mentioned in the provided context to further improve the performance of the deep learning pipeline.
