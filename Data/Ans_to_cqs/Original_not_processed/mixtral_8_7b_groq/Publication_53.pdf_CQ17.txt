Based on the provided context, there are no explicit mentions of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization that were used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, data augmentation was employed to help generalize the model. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by creating modified versions of the images in the dataset. In this case, vertical flipping, limiting overexposure, and disabling zooming were used as data augmentation methods. While data augmentation is not a regularization method per se, it can help reduce overfitting by providing the model with a more diverse set of training examples.

Additionally, transfer learning was utilized by initializing an ImageNet pre-trained ResNet34 model. Transfer learning is another strategy to prevent overfitting, as it leverages the knowledge gained from a pre-trained model, which was trained on a large-scale dataset, and applies it to a new related task. By doing so, the model can learn more robust features and be less prone to overfitting on the new, smaller dataset.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention dropout or L2 regularization, data augmentation and transfer learning were employed to help prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
