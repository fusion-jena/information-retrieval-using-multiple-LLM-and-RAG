Answer:::

In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during data preprocessing in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss various data preprocessing techniques and data analytics methods.

Data preprocessing techniques mentioned include data deduplication, data cleansing, data transformation, and data compression. Data cleansing, which involves removing incorrect, corrupted, or incomplete data, is a mandatory feature in data preprocessing. Other techniques are optional and depend on the needs or purposes of data analytics.

In the context of deep learning, data bias can be a significant issue. Data bias can occur when the data used to train the model is not representative of the population the model will be used on, leading to inaccurate predictions.

To address data bias, techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be used during the data preprocessing phase.

Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures each stratum (or subset) of the population is proportionally represented in the sample. This can help ensure that the sample is representative of the population and reduce data bias.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to address imbalanced classes in the data. Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances in the minority class, while undersampling involves decreasing the number of instances in the majority class. These techniques can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from a variety of sources to ensure that the data is representative of the population. This can help reduce data bias by ensuring that the data used to train the model is representative of the population the model will be used on.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during data preprocessing in a deep learning pipeline, techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be used to address data bias during the data preprocessing phase.
