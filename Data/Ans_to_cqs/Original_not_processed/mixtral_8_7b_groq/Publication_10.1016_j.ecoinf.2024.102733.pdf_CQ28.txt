Answer:::
The provided context does not offer information about which platform, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform, was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on describing the methodology and parameters used for training the MLP model, including the use of the Adam optimizer, different learning rates, batch sizes, and regularization techniques. It also mentions that a similar study was conducted by Canovi et al. in 2023, but there is no reference to the deployment platform. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the platform used for deploying the deep learning model.
