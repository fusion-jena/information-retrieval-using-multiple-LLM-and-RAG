Answer:::

The generalizability of the deep learning model was addressed through several measures, including the diversification of the training data and the implementation of a specific window length. The 3-s window length enabled the use of data augmentation methods, contributing to a more varied training set.

The model design followed the Wide ResNet approach, which consists of 157 layers, 36 of which are weighted. This design choice is consistent with current best practices in deep learning, as summarized in (Chollet, 2017). The original Wide ResNet design was followed, but with modifications to the downsampling blocks as suggested in (Xie et al., 2018). These modifications could potentially enhance the model's ability to generalize.

The classification block, derived from (Schlüter, 2018), resulted in probability predictions for all 987 classes per second, or three predictions for each 3-s input spectrogram. This approach allows the model to consider a broader range of patterns within the data, potentially improving its ability to generalize.

The model was trained using a monochrome input image, a single channel mel spectrogram of size 64 × 384. This size visualizes three seconds of audio at a sampling rate of 48 kHz. The use of mel spectrograms allows the model to consider a wide range of frequencies, which can contribute to the model's generalizability.

However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. While these methods are commonly used to ensure the generalizability of models, their use is not confirmed in this case. Therefore, while several measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, the specific use of cross-validation or stratified splitting is not confirmed.
