Answer:::
The provided context does not include specific information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does mention the use of a validation set in the context of reporting the performance of models on the IP102 dataset. The validation set is used to evaluate the models' performance after training on the training set.

In general, when training deep learning models, the data is typically split into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and evaluate the model during training, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model.

The specific criteria used to split the data can vary depending on the problem and the dataset. A common approach is to randomly split the data into training, validation, and testing sets, ensuring that each set has a representative sample of the data. Another approach is to use time series data and split it based on time, using earlier data for training and later data for testing.

In some cases, the data may be split based on specific criteria, such as class balance or domain distribution. For example, in a classification problem with imbalanced classes, it may be beneficial to oversample the minority class in the training set and use a balanced validation and testing set to evaluate the model's performance.

Overall, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training depend on the specific problem and dataset, and there is no one-size-fits-all approach. It is important to carefully consider the data split strategy and ensure that it is appropriate for the problem at hand.
