The text provided does not give information about any deep learning pipeline or the datasets used in it. The text is about a study that tests a novel approach to biodiversity data collection in marine environments, using a mobile app and post-dive interviews with recreational SCUBA divers. The study focuses on the trade-off between data quality and participation in citizen science initiatives, and the taxa that were frequently requested include various fish and ray species. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query about the deep learning pipeline datasets.
