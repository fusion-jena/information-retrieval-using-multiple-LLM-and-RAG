Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some implicit indications that suggest certain methods may have been used.

Firstly, the context mentions the use of a "non-publicly available dataset" for evaluation. While this doesn't directly contribute to the model's generalizability, it implies that the data used for training the model is likely to be different, which could indirectly help in creating a more generalized model.

Secondly, the context discusses the use of counting metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Relative Error (MARE) for evaluation. While these metrics primarily assess the accuracy of the model, they also provide insights into the model's performance across various error ranges. The mention of MARE, which considers how the error relates to the total object count in the image, suggests that the dataset might have been diverse enough to include images with significantly varying insect counts. This could potentially contribute to the model's generalizability.

Lastly, the context mentions a "Localization Analysis" which might indicate the use of techniques like data augmentation or transfer learning. Data augmentation can help increase the diversity of the training data by creating modified versions of the existing images, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize. Transfer learning, on the other hand, involves using a pre-trained model as a starting point, which can help the model learn more general features before being fine-tuned on the specific task.

However, these are only assumptions based on the given context. To provide a definitive answer, explicit information about the methods used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model would be required.
