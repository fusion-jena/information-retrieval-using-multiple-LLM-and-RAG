Based on the information provided, a deep learning model was used in the study titled "Wind-topo: downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography in highly complex terrain with deep learning" by Dujardin and Lehning (2022). However, the specific deep learning framework or software, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, used to build the model was not mentioned in the given text.

It is important to note that the term "deep learning" is used in the title of the study, but the methods described in the text focus on machine learning techniques such as Random Forests (RFs), Generalized Boosted Models (GBMs), Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). While these techniques can be considered part of the broader field of machine learning, they do not fall under the specific subfield of deep learning.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine which deep learning framework was used in this study.
