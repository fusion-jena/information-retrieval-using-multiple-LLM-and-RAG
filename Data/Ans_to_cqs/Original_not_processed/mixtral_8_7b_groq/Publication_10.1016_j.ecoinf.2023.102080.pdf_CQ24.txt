Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the strategies employed to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on a two-step embedded covariate selection procedure for species distribution models, which involves a collinearity-filtering algorithm and three model-specific embedded regularization techniques. There is no mention of deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in such a context. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query without additional information.
