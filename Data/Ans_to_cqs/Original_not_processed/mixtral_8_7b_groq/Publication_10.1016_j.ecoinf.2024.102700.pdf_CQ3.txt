The provided context discusses the literature search and review of methodologies used in species distribution modeling, including the use of machine learning techniques. However, it does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for tasks such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

In general, data annotation techniques in deep learning pipelines are crucial for training models in computer vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Some common data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in an image. The coordinates of the box are then used as labels for the object during training.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image to indicate the object it belongs to. This allows for more precise localization of objects, especially when they overlap or are occluded.
3. Semantic segmentation: Similar to instance segmentation, this technique involves labeling each pixel in an image, but with the difference that pixels belonging to the same object class are given the same label, without distinguishing individual instances.

These techniques require manual annotation by human annotators or automated tools. The choice of annotation technique depends on the specific task and the desired level of precision.

Therefore, while the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for species distribution modeling, it is important to note that such techniques are crucial for training deep learning models in computer vision tasks.
