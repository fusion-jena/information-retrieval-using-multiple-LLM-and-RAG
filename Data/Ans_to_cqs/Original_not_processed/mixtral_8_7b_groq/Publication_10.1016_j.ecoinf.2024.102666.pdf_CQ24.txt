The provided context does not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) for atmospheric correction (AC) in satellite images. While this is not a direct answer to the query, it does suggest that the field of AC for satellite images utilizes randomness in the form of ANN.

ANN are a type of machine learning model that are composed of interconnected layers of nodes, or "neurons," and are trained using a dataset to learn patterns and relationships within the data. During training, ANN use random initialization of weights and biases, and techniques such as dropout and data augmentation may also introduce randomness to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

In the context of AC for satellite images, ANN models like the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) have been shown to be effective in diverse aquatic environments. The FLAASH model uses an internal pixel averaging technique to mitigate the spatial proximity effect, which is essential for achieving high-quality AC. This suggests that the use of randomness in the form of ANN can contribute to the stability and efficiency of AC for satellite images.

However, the provided context does not explicitly discuss the use of a random seed value as a strategy for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, a direct answer to the query cannot be provided based on the given information.
