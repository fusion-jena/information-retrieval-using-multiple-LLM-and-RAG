The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used for sound classification, and it's common to use optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or others during the training of neural networks. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that some optimization technique was used, but the specific one is not mentioned in the provided context.
