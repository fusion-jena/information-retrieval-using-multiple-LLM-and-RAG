Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) for plant species identification, comparing the efficiency of leaf features learned using CNN with other methods. It discusses the need for large amounts of training data for deep CNN networks and the relative size and variety of various existing datasets. The text also explores the question of how many convolutional layers are required for optimal modeling of plant data. However, it does not mention any cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model.
