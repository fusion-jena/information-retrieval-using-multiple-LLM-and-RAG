Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the postprocessing steps taken after model training. However, it does mention the use of various statistical models, including the M5 model, for analyzing dependencies. It also discusses the preprocessing step of standardization, which involves changing the scope of individual variables so that they are presented in a similar numerical range while preserving the distance relations between individual data.

In general, after training a model, there are several common postprocessing steps that can be taken to further analyze and understand the model's performance. Here are a few examples:

1. **Calculation of Metrics:** Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score can be calculated to evaluate the model's performance. These metrics can provide insights into how well the model is classifying data points.

2. **Confusion Matrix:** A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It can show the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, which can be used to calculate various metrics.

3. **Saliency Maps:** Saliency maps are a way to visualize the importance of different features in the model's decision-making process. They can highlight which features the model is paying the most attention to when making predictions.

4. **Model Interpretation:** This can involve explaining the model's decisions in human-understandable terms. For example, feature importance can be calculated to understand which features are driving the model's predictions.

5. **Model Validation:** This involves testing the model on a separate validation set to ensure that it generalizes well to new data.

Based on the provided context, it is likely that some of these postprocessing steps were taken, but the specific steps are not mentioned.
