The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. This is evident from the context provided, specifically Table 3 which shows the results of the model's steps and indicates that the model is a 13-step process used for classification. Additionally, Table 4 is a classification table that further supports the model's purpose of classification. The model is used to classify observed data into two categories, with the correct percentage of classifications increasing as the steps of the model progress. However, the specific details of what the model is classifying are not provided in the context.
