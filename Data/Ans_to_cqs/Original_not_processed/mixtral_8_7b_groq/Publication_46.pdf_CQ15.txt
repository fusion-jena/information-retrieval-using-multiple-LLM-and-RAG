Answer:::

In the deep learning pipeline, several optimization techniques can be applied to adjust the weights of neurons and improve the network's performance. Two popular optimization techniques are Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple yet efficient optimization algorithm used in deep learning. SGD updates the weights of neurons in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function concerning a single training example (or a mini-batch of examples) at each iteration. This approach allows SGD to converge faster than traditional gradient descent, which uses the entire training dataset to compute the gradient at each iteration. However, SGD may not always converge to the optimal solution due to its stochastic nature, and it may require careful tuning of the learning rate to achieve good performance.

Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is another optimization algorithm used in deep learning. Adam combines the advantages of two other optimization algorithms, AdaGrad and RMSProp, to adaptively adjust the learning rate for each parameter. Specifically, Adam estimates the first and second moments of the gradient to compute the adaptive learning rate for each parameter. This approach allows Adam to handle sparse gradients better than AdaGrad and to converge faster than RMSProp. Adam has become a popular optimization algorithm in deep learning due to its simplicity, efficiency, and robustness.

In summary, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam are two popular optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. SGD is a simple yet efficient algorithm that updates the weights of neurons in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function concerning a single training example or a mini-batch of examples. Adam is an adaptive optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of AdaGrad and RMSProp to estimate the first and second moments of the gradient and compute the adaptive learning rate for each parameter. These optimization techniques help adjust the weights of neurons and improve the network's performance in the deep learning pipeline.
