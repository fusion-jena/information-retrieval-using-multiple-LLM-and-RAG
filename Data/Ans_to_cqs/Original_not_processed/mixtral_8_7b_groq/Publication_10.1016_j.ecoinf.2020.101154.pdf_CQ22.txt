The provided context does not specify the exact metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models. However, it does mention that hyperparameters were optimized based on the performance of the models on the test dataset, and a three-way split was performed to confirm the model's performance.

In the context, the models' performance is evaluated by using a three-way split of the data, where the data is split into train (50%), test (25%), and validation (25%) sets. The model is built, tested, and optimized using the train and validation sets, and the model's performance is confirmed using the test set. This approach is a common method to evaluate the performance of machine learning models.

The metrics used to evaluate the models' performance could be any of the following: accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), R-squared, etc. The choice of metric depends on the problem at hand and the business objective. For example, for a classification problem, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are commonly used, while for a regression problem, MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R-squared are commonly used.

Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query. However, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the models' performance is evaluated using a three-way split of the data and optimized using the train and validation sets, and the model's performance is confirmed using the test set.
