Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in a machine learning or data analysis context. However, there are some related details about data analysis and modeling that can be discussed.

In the context of analyzing bivalve gaping data, Bertolini et al. (2021a) describe the process of averaging gaping data over 5-minute intervals in the Venice Lagoon and over 1-minute intervals in the Wadden Sea. They then use these daily curves of gaping as input in their analysis, yielding 1286 daily curves for the Venice Lagoon and 203 daily curves for the Wadden Sea. However, the criteria used to determine the adequacy of this data processing and analysis are not specified.

In a more general machine learning context, there are several common criteria used to determine when training is complete. One common criterion is when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing, indicating that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data and is not overfitting. Another criterion is when the model reaches a predetermined level of accuracy or performance on a validation set. Additionally, early stopping techniques can be used to halt training when performance on a validation set stops improving, even if the training loss is still decreasing.

Overall, while the provided context does not directly answer the query about criteria used to determine when training is complete, there are some related details about data analysis and modeling that can be discussed. In general, criteria such as validation loss plateaus, predetermined levels of accuracy, and early stopping techniques can be used to determine when training is complete in a machine learning context.
