After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps involved, such as calculating metrics, generating saliency maps (although not explicitly mentioned in the provided context), and creating confusion matrices.

Firstly, the performance of the trained model is evaluated using various metrics. In the given context, two primary metrics are mentioned: accuracy and loss. Accuracy refers to the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions. Loss, on the other hand, measures the difference between the model's predictions and the actual classes. Lower loss values indicate better model performance. These metrics are calculated for both the training and validation sets.

Additionally, the model's performance is tested on two separate datasets: individual tiles and whole repeat photographs. For individual tiles, the accuracy is calculated using a test set consisting of 5796 tiles, which is 10% of the total number of samples. For whole repeat photographs, the accuracy is evaluated by comparing the classification results of the model with the corresponding manual classifications (reference data) for each image. A confusion matrix is prepared for each photograph individually, which contains pixel numbers for true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

A confusion matrix is a specific type of table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model (or "classifier") on a set of test data for which the true values are known. It allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm.

Saliency maps, which are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, can be used as a postprocessing step to visualize the regions of the input data that the model considers most important for its predictions. Saliency maps can help in interpreting the model's decision-making process and understanding which features the model relies on for making predictions.

In summary, after training a model, the performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy and loss. The model's performance is further assessed on separate datasets, and confusion matrices are prepared for each dataset to evaluate the classification results. Although not mentioned in the provided context, saliency maps can be used as a postprocessing step to visualize and interpret the model's predictions.
