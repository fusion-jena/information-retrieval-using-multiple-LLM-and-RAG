Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for land use and land cover changes. However, it is mentioned that Kim et al. (2021) used deep learning models with satellite imageries over multiple periods for classification, and the classification accuracy and performance improved as data increased during the training of the deep learning model.

In general, data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the amount of training data, reduce overfitting, and improve model performance. Flipping involves horizontally or vertically flipping the images, while rotating involves rotating the images by a certain angle. Scaling involves changing the size of the images. Other data augmentation techniques include cropping, brightness adjustment, and adding noise.

In the context of land use and land cover changes, data augmentation techniques can be useful for addressing issues such as class imbalance, where certain classes have fewer samples than others. For example, if there are fewer samples of a particular land cover class, data augmentation techniques can be used to generate more synthetic samples of that class.

Therefore, while the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for land use and land cover changes are not mentioned in the provided context, it is likely that techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling were used to increase the amount of training data and improve model performance.
