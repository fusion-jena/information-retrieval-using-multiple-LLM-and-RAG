Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it is well-known that these steps are crucial in the preprocessing phase of machine learning pipelines, including deep learning.

Normalization and scaling are typically used to adjust the range of input features so that the model can learn effectively. This is because different features might have different scales, and using unnormalized data can lead to slower convergence or even poor model performance. Common normalization techniques include z-score normalization (subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation) and min-max scaling (rescaling the data between a given range, such as 0 and 1).

Cleaning refers to the process of handling missing or corrupted data, outlier detection, and noise reduction. These steps are essential to ensure the quality of the data and improve the model's ability to generalize.

In addition to these preprocessing techniques, other steps might be required depending on the specific problem and data. For instance, data augmentation techniques (as mentioned in Nanni et al., 2020) can be used to artificially increase the size of the dataset and improve the model's performance, especially in computer vision tasks.

In the context of deep learning, libraries like Keras (Chollet et al., 2015) provide utilities for data preprocessing, such as the `keras.layers.experimental.preprocessing` module, which includes layers for normalization, scaling, and other preprocessing tasks.

To summarize, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps for deep learning models, it is well-established that normalization, scaling, and cleaning are essential steps in the preprocessing phase. These steps help ensure the quality of the data, improve model convergence, and enhance the model's ability to generalize.
