Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the mentioned models and techniques, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for regression analysis in the context of ecological informatics.

The models mentioned in the context, such as XGB, SVR, and MLP, are primarily used for regression or prediction tasks. For instance, XGB (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is used for optimizing predictive modeling through gradient boosting and regularization. SVR (Support Vector Regression) uses kernel functions to handle non-linear data by fitting the best hyperplane within a pre-defined error margin. MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) is a feed-forward neural network that learns complex patterns using adjustable weights and activation functions. These models are typically used for predicting continuous outcomes, such as numerical variables, rather than classification or segmentation tasks.

Furthermore, the negative mean square error is set as the target measure for hyperparameter tuning, which is a common evaluation metric for regression tasks. The use of this metric also suggests that the deep learning model is used for predicting a continuous outcome.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for regression analysis in the context of ecological informatics.
