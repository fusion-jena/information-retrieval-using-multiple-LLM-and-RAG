Based on the provided context, the generalizability of the deep learning model seems to have been addressed through several measures.

Firstly, the model was trained on a diverse dataset. The dataset consisted of presence-only observations, which means that the model was exposed to a wide range of environmental conditions where the species were known to be present. This could help the model learn the true distribution of the species and improve its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Secondly, the model was optimized using a cross-entropy loss function. This type of loss function is commonly used in deep learning, especially for classification problems. It measures the difference between the predicted probabilities and the true probabilities, and the model is trained to minimize this difference. By using a cross-entropy loss function, the model is encouraged to make accurate predictions for all classes, not just the majority class. This can help improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Thirdly, the model was trained using a deep species distribution model (SDM). The SDM is a type of model that is specifically designed to predict the presence or absence of a species based on environmental predictors. By using an SDM, the model is able to learn the complex, scale-dependent relationships between species and their environment. This can help improve the model's ability to generalize to new data, especially when the environmental conditions are different from those in the training data.

Finally, the model was trained on presence-only data, all species combined (multi-species SDM), and was then used to predict a set of labels by thresholding the SDM output categorical probabilities associated to species. This approach is derived from what is called set-valued prediction (or set-valued classification) in the machine learning community. By predicting a set of labels instead of a single label, the model is able to account for uncertainty in the predictions and provide a more robust estimate of the species assemblages. This can help improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

In summary, the generalizability of the deep learning model was addressed through the use of a diverse dataset, a cross-entropy loss function, a deep species distribution model, and set-valued prediction. These measures were taken to ensure that the model is able to make accurate predictions for new, unseen data.
