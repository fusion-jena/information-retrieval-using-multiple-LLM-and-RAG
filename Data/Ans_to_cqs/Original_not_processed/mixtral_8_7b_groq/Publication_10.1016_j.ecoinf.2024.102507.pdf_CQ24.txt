Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, there are some techniques mentioned that could indirectly help manage randomness.

Firstly, the study uses a specific network architecture, ResNet, which includes a residual unit with a short-circuit mechanism. This mechanism can potentially help stabilize the learning process by providing a direct path for the gradient to flow, thereby reducing the impact of randomness in gradient computation.

Secondly, the authors use a method called spectral segmentation and band selection (SSDM) to choose the most relevant bands for deep learning. This method could reduce the influence of randomness by selecting more robust and representative features.

Moreover, in the sample extraction process, the study increases the number of samples of small forest types by moving a distance of 128 pixels in the x and y directions and rotating every 45 degrees when creating the next image unit. These procedures could also help reduce the effect of randomness by providing a more diverse and comprehensive set of training samples.

However, these measures do not directly address the randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the random initialization of weights or the randomness in dropout regularization. To handle these aspects of randomness, setting a random seed value is a common practice. Unfortunately, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine if such a strategy was employed in this study.
