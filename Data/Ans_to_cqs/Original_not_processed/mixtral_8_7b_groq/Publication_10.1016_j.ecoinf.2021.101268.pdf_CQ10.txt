Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the introduction of a new dataset, the Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset, and a comparison of deep learning models for feature extraction on this dataset. However, it does not mention or provide any information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. I hope this information is helpful, and I apologize for any inconvenience.
