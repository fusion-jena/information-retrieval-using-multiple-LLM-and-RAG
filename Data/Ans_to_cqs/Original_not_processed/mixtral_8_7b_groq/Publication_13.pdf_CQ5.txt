Answer: The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it does mention the use of three datasets referred to as GH, LL, and LH. These datasets are used for within-dataset classification and between-datasets classification. The GH dataset is used as a source dataset to predict images from the LH and LL target datasets. Similarly, the LL dataset is used as a source dataset to predict images from the LH target dataset. These datasets likely consist of images, as the study focuses on image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The LL dataset is referred to as a Local Low Quality dataset, implying that it may contain lower resolution or quality images compared to the other datasets. However, the specific details about these datasets, such as their size, number of classes, and type of images, are not provided in the context.
