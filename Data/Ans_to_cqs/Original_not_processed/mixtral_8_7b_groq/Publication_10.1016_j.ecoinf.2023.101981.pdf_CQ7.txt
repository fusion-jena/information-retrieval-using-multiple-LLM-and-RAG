Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does mention that Kaleidoscope Pro 5.3.9 (Wildlife Acoustics) was used to scan the acoustic dataset, and the output includes all the regions of interest (ROIs) that meet the desired signal parameters. These parameters include maximum intersyllable gap (ms), minimum and maximum detection lengths (s), and minimum and maximum frequencies (Hz).

In the context of training a deep learning model, it's common to split the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model performance.

One possible approach for splitting the data in this case could be based on time. For instance, you could split the dataset into three time periods: an initial period for training, a middle period for validation, and a final period for testing. This approach would ensure that the data used for training, validation, and testing are temporally independent, which is important for building a robust model.

Another possible approach could be based on spatial location. If you have data from multiple locations, you could use data from some locations for training, data from other locations for validation, and data from yet other locations for testing. This approach would help ensure that the model can generalize well to new, unseen locations.

Ultimately, the choice of criteria for splitting the data will depend on the specific research question and the characteristics of the dataset. It's important to carefully consider the potential biases and limitations of any splitting approach and to validate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
