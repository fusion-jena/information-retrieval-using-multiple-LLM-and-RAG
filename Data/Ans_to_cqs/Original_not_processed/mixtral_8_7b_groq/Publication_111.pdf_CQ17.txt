Answer: The provided context discusses the use of dropout as a regularization strategy to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. Dropout is a method that involves randomly dropping out a certain proportion of layer neurons during training, allowing the neural network to train with alternative topologies in parallel. This helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons and promoting the learning of more robust features.

The context also describes the use of the Mean Square Error (MSE) loss function in the deep learning model. While MSE loss function is not a regularization method itself, it can be used in conjunction with other regularization techniques such as dropout to prevent overfitting.

However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of L2 regularization or any other regularization methods besides dropout. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a method that involves adding a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This helps to prevent overfitting by discouraging large weight values and promoting the learning of more generalizable features.

In summary, the provided context discusses the use of dropout as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of L2 regularization or any other regularization methods.
