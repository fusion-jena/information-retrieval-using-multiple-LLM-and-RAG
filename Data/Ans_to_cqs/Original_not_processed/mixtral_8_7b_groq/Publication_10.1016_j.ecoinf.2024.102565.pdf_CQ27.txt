Answer:::
The context provided does not give detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that a Neural Network (NN) model was used as part of the Wind2TSM model to estimate the average concentration of Total Suspended Matter (TSM) in a lake based on wind speed. 

The NN model, like other machine learning methodologies used in the study, was trained using wind speed as input. After training, these models enable predictions for new data points, offering both point estimates and insights into prediction uncertainty. 

As for the deployment of the trained NN model, the context is silent. However, in general terms, deploying a deep learning model like an NN typically involves several steps. 

First, the trained model is usually saved or serialized to disk, allowing it to be loaded and used in different environments or platforms. This process often involves converting the model into a format that can be easily loaded and used, such as a JSON file or a specific format for a particular deep learning framework.

Second, the platform for deployment is selected. This could be a local machine, a cloud-based platform, or an edge device, depending on the requirements of the application. 

Third, the model is loaded into the chosen platform and integrated with any necessary data input and output pipelines. This might involve creating a web API for the model, or integrating it into a larger software system.

Finally, the model is tested and validated in the deployment environment to ensure it performs as expected.

Without more specific information from the context, it's not possible to say for sure whether these steps were followed in the deployment of the NN model in the Wind2TSM study.
