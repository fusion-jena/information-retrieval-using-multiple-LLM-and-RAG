Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context includes information about an online chronic disease prediction system based on an incremental deep neural network [22] and a study on coral classification using hyper-spectral bottom index imagery and deep convolutional neural network VGG-19 [8, 9]. However, there is no mention of the data repository for these studies.

It is important to note that making the data and code publicly available is a good practice in research, as it promotes transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration. Therefore, it is recommended that the authors share their data and code in a public repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.

Another way to find the data repository is to look for the paper's citation or the author's website. Sometimes, the authors provide a link to the data repository in the paper or on their website.

Therefore, I would recommend searching for the paper's citation or the author's website to find the data repository. If the data repository is not available, it is recommended to contact the authors and request access to the data.
