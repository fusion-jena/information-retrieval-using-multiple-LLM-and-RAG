Answer:::

The regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, is dropout. 

Dropout is a technique used during training deep learning models to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out, or "turning off", a proportion of neurons in a layer during each training iteration. This helps to make the model more robust and less dependent on the training data, as it forces the model to learn more generalized features. 

In the given table 3, it can be observed that for each configuration, there is a column for "Without Dropout" and a column for "With Dropout", indicating that dropout was used as a regularization method in some of the models. 

Additionally, the findings indicate that Model 9 exhibits the highest average performance, with an 89.30% accuracy rate, and it is the most optimal deep learning model. Model 9 incorporates dropout, Adamâ€™s optimizer, and a 0.001 learning rate. This further highlights the effectiveness of dropout as a regularization method in preventing overfitting and improving the performance of deep learning models.
