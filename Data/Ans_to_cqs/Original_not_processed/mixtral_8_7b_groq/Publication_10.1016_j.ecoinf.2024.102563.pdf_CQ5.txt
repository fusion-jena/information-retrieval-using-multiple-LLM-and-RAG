Answer:::

The provided pieces of context do not contain information about the specific datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet) used in deep learning pipelines. These datasets are commonly used for training and testing deep learning models in various applications, such as image recognition and classification. However, the context focuses on different topics, including digital soil mapping, remote sensing, and land use classification, using various methods and techniques, such as artificial neural networks, random forests, and co-occurrence texture statistics.

For instance, Mohammadi and Toomanian (2016) used a digital soil mapping dataset to predict soil properties using artificial neural networks. Zhang et al. (2023) used a remote sensing dataset to identify land types and tree species in the Engebei ecological demonstration area based on GF-1 imagery. Zhong et al. (2019) used a time-series remote sensing dataset to classify multi-temporal crops using deep learning. Zhu et al. (2008) used a digital soil mapping dataset with limited data to develop a purposive sampling method. Zhu et al. (2022) used a Sentinel-1/2 SAR and MSI imagery dataset to identify soybean under a complex planting structure.

Therefore, while the context provides valuable information on various aspects of digital soil mapping, remote sensing, and land use classification, it does not mention the specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines.
