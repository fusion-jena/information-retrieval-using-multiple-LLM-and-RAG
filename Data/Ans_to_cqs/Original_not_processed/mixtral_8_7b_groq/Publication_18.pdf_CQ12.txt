Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNNs are a specialized type of neural networks that are particularly effective at extracting spatial patterns from images. They are built by stacking three main types of layers: convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Convolutional layers are used to extract features at different levels of the hierarchy, pooling layers are used to increase the abstraction level of the extracted features, and fully connected layers are used as a classifier at the end of the pipeline. CNNs have been shown to be highly effective in a wide range of computer vision tasks, including image classification and object detection. In fact, CNNs constitute the state-of-the-art in these tasks, outperforming other types of deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers. This is likely because CNNs are specifically designed to handle the spatial structure of images, whereas RNNs and Transformers are more suited to handling sequential data.
