The text does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it does mention that various hyper-parameters such as network capacity (number of layers and neurons per layer), regularization techniques, loss function, and optimizer were evaluated iteratively. This suggests that some form of hyperparameter optimization was used, but the specific method (e.g., grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization) is not specified. It is also possible that a manual or heuristic search was used to find the optimal hyperparameters. Therefore, while it is clear that hyperparameter optimization was performed, the specific method used cannot be determined based on the provided context.
