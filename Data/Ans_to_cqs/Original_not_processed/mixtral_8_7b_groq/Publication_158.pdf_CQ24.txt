Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of an ensemble of three deep learning models to handle variability in the results, which can be attributed to factors such as weight initialization and random selection for batch training. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of a fixed random seed value to manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, deep learning frameworks utilize randomness in various stages of the training process, including weight initialization, data shuffling, and dropout regularization. A fixed random seed value ensures consistent and reproducible results by controlling the randomness in these stages.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a fixed random seed value, it does mention the use of an ensemble of three models. Ensembling can be seen as an alternative approach to managing variability in deep learning models, as it combines the predictions of multiple models to produce a more robust and accurate output.

In summary, although the provided context does not explicitly discuss the use of a fixed random seed value, it does mention the use of an ensemble of models to manage variability in the deep learning pipeline. In practice, using a fixed random seed value in conjunction with ensembling can provide a more comprehensive solution for handling randomness and ensuring reproducibility in deep learning models.
