The provided context discusses the differences between deep learning and XGBoost models, as well as the use of XGBoost for Fv/Fm parameter estimation. However, it does not directly mention data augmentation techniques in the context of deep learning. 

Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning to increase the diversity of the training data without actually collecting new data. These techniques include flipping, rotating, and scaling, which are used to generate variations of the original images. 

Flipping involves creating a mirrored image by reversing the image horizontally or vertically. This helps the model to learn symmetrical patterns in the data. 

Rotating involves rotating the image by a certain angle. This helps the model to learn rotation invariant features.

Scaling involves changing the size of the image. This helps the model to learn features that are scale invariant.

Other data augmentation techniques include brightness adjustment, contrast adjustment, and adding noise to the images.

These techniques are widely used in deep learning pipelines, especially for image classification tasks. However, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the study on Fv/Fm parameter estimation.
