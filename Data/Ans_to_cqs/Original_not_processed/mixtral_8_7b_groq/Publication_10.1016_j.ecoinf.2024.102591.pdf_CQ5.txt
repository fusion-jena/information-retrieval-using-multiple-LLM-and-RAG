The provided context does not include information about the deep learning pipeline or specific datasets commonly used in deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context focuses on wildfire data sources, geospatial data acquisition and storage, and the use of Google Earth Engine for processing remote sensing data.

To answer the query, I would need access to information about the deep learning pipeline and the datasets used in that context. However, based on the query, I can provide a brief overview of the mentioned datasets:

1. MNIST: Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) dataset is a large database of handwritten digits (0-9) widely used for training various image processing models, including deep learning models. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each of size 28x28 pixels.
2. CIFAR: Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) datasets are collections of labeled images used for object recognition tasks. There are two popular versions: CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. CIFAR-10 consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. CIFAR-100 has 100 classes, each containing 600 images of size 32x32 pixels.
3. ImageNet: ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) dataset is a large-scale dataset of images used for object detection, image classification, and other computer vision tasks. It contains more than 1.2 million high-resolution images distributed across 1,000 classes.

Answer:::
 The provided context does not include information on the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the query, MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet are popular datasets used for training deep learning models in image processing and computer vision tasks.
