Answer:::
The code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study discussed in the provided context is available on GitHub. You can access it using the following link: github.com/IgnacioHeredia/plant-classification. This repository contains the code for the plant classification project using deep learning techniques, specifically the ResNet50 architecture. The code is provided along with the paper to help researchers and developers replicate the study and build upon the work. With this code, you can evaluate the model's performance on the Google Image Search, Portuguese Flora, and iNaturalist datasets, and even extend the project to other large-scale biodiversity monitoring initiatives.
