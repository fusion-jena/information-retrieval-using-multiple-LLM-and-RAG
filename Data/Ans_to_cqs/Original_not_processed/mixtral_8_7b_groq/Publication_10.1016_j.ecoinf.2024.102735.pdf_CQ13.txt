Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not mentioned. The text focuses on the use of ensemble models, specifically Random Forest (RF), and Hyperparameter Tuning using the Optuna package. It mentions that the Optuna package was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the models, but it does not specify the hyperparameters that were optimized. In the context of deep learning, hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, optimizer, etc., are commonly optimized. However, these are not specified in the context. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
