Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention or give information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that the authors have not made the code publicly available, or it may be available on a different platform or through direct contact with the authors. If you are interested in the code, I would recommend reaching out to the authors or looking for other publicly available code that uses similar methods for bird species recognition.
