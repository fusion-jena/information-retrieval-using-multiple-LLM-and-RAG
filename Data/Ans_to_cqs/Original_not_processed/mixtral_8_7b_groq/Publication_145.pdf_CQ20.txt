Answer:::

The deep learning model was trained using the GPU of an Nvidia RTX2080 graphics card. This is stated in the first piece of context, which mentions that "The model was coded in the programming language R with Rstudio interface to Keras using a GPU of an Nvidia RTX2080 graphics card with Tensorflow backend."

Additionally, the second piece of context provides some details about the training process, stating that "The training of the models took 2-20 hours using GPU of an Nvidia RTX2080 graphics card with Tensorflow backend."

Therefore, it is clear that the deep learning model was trained using the GPU of an Nvidia RTX2080 graphics card and Tensorflow backend.
