Answer:::
In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of specific strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does describe the use of a K-fold cross-validation technique, specifically a four-fold cross-validation, during the validation phase of machine learning algorithms. This technique helps to account for variability and randomness in the dataset by dividing it into mutually exclusive folds and iteratively training and testing the model on different subsets of the data.

In the context of this study, the dataset was initially extracted and the feature set was randomly divided into four folds through stratified sampling. Each fold served as the validation set, while the remaining three folds constituted the training set for model training. This approach allows for a more robust evaluation of the model's performance, as it is trained and tested on different subsets of the data, reducing the likelihood of overfitting and increasing the generalizability of the model.

Furthermore, to address imbalances in the training set, random under-sampling (RUS) was applied. Although this technique does not directly address randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it can help to improve the model's performance by balancing the class distribution and reducing the impact of potential noise or outliers in the data.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value or other strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does describe the implementation of a K-fold cross-validation technique and random under-sampling, which can help to account for variability and randomness in the dataset.
