During the training of the machine learning models for predicting Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD) incidence, early stopping was implemented as a strategy to monitor model performance and prevent overfitting.

Early stopping is a process that stops growing additional trees, layers, or splits when further addition does not improve the validation statistic in the case of bootstrap forest and boosted tree methods. In this study, the validation statistic included the R2 value for a continuous response. Early stopping was enabled for the entire machine learning model to ensure that the model would not overfit the predicted percent CLCuD.

Moreover, to address the inclination of neural networks to overfit data, the penalty method was employed within the framework of ANN models. This method helps in regularizing the model and preventing it from learning the noise in the training data.

Additionally, variable importance analysis was conducted for the best-fit models under Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Bootstrap Forest, and Boosted Tree. The variable importance analysis helps in understanding the relative contribution of each input variable towards the prediction of CLCuD. This analysis can provide insights into the most important ecological variables that influence the disease incidence, which can be useful for monitoring and managing the disease in cotton fields.

Overall, the early stopping strategy, along with the penalty method and variable importance analysis, helps in monitoring the model performance during training and ensuring that the model is not overfitting the data. This approach can lead to more accurate and reliable predictions of CLCuD incidence, which can ultimately support timely management interventions and boost cotton productivity in the region.
