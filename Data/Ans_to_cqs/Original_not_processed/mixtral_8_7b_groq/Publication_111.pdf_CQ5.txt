The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for predicting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH) are not specified as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the paper mentions that the models were applied to a real dataset obtained from the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency. The dataset is used to train and test the performance of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. The deep learning model used in this study is a GRU-DNN (Gated Recurrent Units with a regular Deep Neural Network) architecture, which is implemented in Python. However, the specific details of the dataset, such as its size, format, and preprocessing steps, are not provided in the given context.
