Based on the provided context, there is not enough information to determine the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the publication of data ranges for tons per hectare, fire severity and combustion efficiency, and the processes carried out within GEE to produce a time series dataset for mainland China.

Answer:::
The context does not provide information on the training process, including the model used, the optimization algorithm, or the evaluation metric. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the criteria for when training is considered complete.

Answer:::
In general, training of machine learning models is considered complete when the validation loss reaches a plateau or stops decreasing significantly. However, the specific criteria can vary depending on the problem, the dataset, and the model. The context provided does not contain enough information to determine the criteria used for this particular dataset.
