Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a loss function that measures the dissimilarity between the clean bird sound signal (β) and the processed bird sound signal (g(x; θ)) generated by the noise reduction network. This loss function is based on the L1 norm, which is less sensitive to outliers and provides a more interpretable measure of error compared to the L2 norm.

The loss function is defined as the absolute difference between the feature activations of the m-th feature layer in the 1st to M-th shallowest network layers of the audio classification loss network for the clean bird sound signal and the processed bird sound signal. The feature activations capture the relevant characteristics of the input signals, and by comparing them, the loss function measures how well the noise reduction network is preserving these characteristics in the processed signals.

During training, the weight (λm) associated with this loss function is updated based on the relative value of the loss function. Specifically, after 10 training iterations, the weight is set to the reciprocal of the loss function value. This adjustment ensures that the noise reduction network prioritizes reducing the noise in the segments of the bird sound signal that are most similar to the clean bird sound signal.

The loss function value is backpropagated through the noise reduction network to update the network parameters. This process is iterated over the training dataset to obtain a trained bird sound denoising model.

Additionally, the performance of the model is evaluated on a test set comprising 68 clean bird sound segments randomly selected from the dataset. The test set provides an independent measure of the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a loss function based on the L1 norm to measure the dissimilarity between the clean bird sound signal and the processed bird sound signal, adjusting the weight associated with this loss function based on the relative value of the loss function, and evaluating the model's performance on a test set.
