Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of specific hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs for training the deep learning model. However, it does give details about the computational resources and environment used for the study. The operation system is CentOS Linux release 7.7.1908 (Core) with 32 CPUs, and each CPU has 64 processors. The development environment is Python (version 3.6.2) packaged by Conda-forge which is compiled with GCC (version 4.8.2,20140120). The tool packages used in the virtual environment are TensorFlow (version 1.12.0) and Numpy (version 1.19.2). Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning models were trained using the CPU resources along with the TensorFlow library, which can also utilize GPU resources if they are available. However, the context does not provide information on whether GPUs were used in this particular case.
