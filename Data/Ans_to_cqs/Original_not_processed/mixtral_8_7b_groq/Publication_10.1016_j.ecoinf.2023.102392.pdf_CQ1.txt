The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of high spatial and ultra-high resolution remote sensing data for forest type categorization. This suggests that some form of remote sensing technology, such as satellite or aerial imaging, may have been used to collect the raw data.

Additionally, the context also mentions the use of surveys and public datasets in other studies, but it does not specify if these methods were used in the deep learning pipeline in question.

In general, the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline can vary widely depending on the specific application and the type of data being collected. Some common methods include:

* Surveys: Surveys can be used to collect data through direct questioning of individuals or organizations. This can be done through online or paper-based questionnaires, interviews, or focus groups.
* Sensors: Sensors can be used to collect data automatically, such as through the use of cameras, microphones, or other devices that measure physical phenomena.
* Public datasets: Public datasets, such as those made available by government agencies or research organizations, can be used as a source of raw data for deep learning models.

It is important to note that the choice of data collection method will depend on the specific requirements of the deep learning pipeline and the type of data that is needed.
