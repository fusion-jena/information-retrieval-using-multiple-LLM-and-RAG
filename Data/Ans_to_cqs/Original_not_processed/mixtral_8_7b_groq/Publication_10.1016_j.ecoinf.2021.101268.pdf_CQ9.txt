Answer:::
The data repository for the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset was introduced in the paper, which includes 59,441 samples from ten of the most profitable and endangered species. The data was collected using six different commercial cameras to ensure variability and enable the development of flexible solutions for real-world conditions.

The paper also mentions that the data distribution is 70.12% for training, 1.69% for validation, and 28.19% for testing. The models were trained using the ADAM optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-3 and 16 elements per mini-batch. The experiments were run on a PC with a 4.0 GHz Intel Core i9 processor, 32 GB 3000 MHz DDR4 memory, and an NVIDIA Titan RTX.

Therefore, while the data repository is not explicitly mentioned, the paper provides a detailed description of the dataset, including its metadata and acquisition protocol. It is likely that the dataset is available upon request from the authors or through a data sharing platform, but further information is needed to determine the exact location of the repository.
