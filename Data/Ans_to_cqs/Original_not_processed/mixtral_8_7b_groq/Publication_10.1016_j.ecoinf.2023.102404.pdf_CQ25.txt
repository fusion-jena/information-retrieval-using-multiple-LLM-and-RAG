Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the purpose of a deep learning model in the mentioned studies. However, I can provide some insights into the general applications of deep learning models in remote sensing, based on the context and the references.

Deep learning models have been widely used in remote sensing for various purposes, such as classification, segmentation, and object detection. In the context of the studies, deep learning models have been applied to analyze and interpret remote sensing data for tasks like canopy height mapping, crop growth monitoring, and forest biomass estimation.

For instance, in the study by Tang et al. (2022), a neural network-guided interpolation approach was used to map canopy height of China's forests by integrating GEDI and ICESat-2 data. Although the study does not explicitly mention the purpose of the deep learning model, it can be inferred that the model was used for regression or prediction tasks.

Similarly, in the study by Ma et al. (2019), a meta-analysis and review of deep learning in remote sensing applications were conducted. The authors discussed various deep learning architectures and their applications in remote sensing, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

In the study by Mandal et al. (2020), a dual polarimetric radar vegetation index was developed for crop growth monitoring using Sentinel-1 SAR data. While the study primarily focused on the development of a radar vegetation index, deep learning models could be employed for classification or segmentation tasks in similar applications.

In summary, although the provided context does not explicitly mention the purpose of a deep learning model, deep learning models have been widely used in remote sensing for various purposes, such as classification, segmentation, and object detection. These models can be applied to analyze and interpret remote sensing data for tasks like canopy height mapping, crop growth monitoring, and forest biomass estimation.
