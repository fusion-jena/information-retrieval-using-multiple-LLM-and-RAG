Based on the provided context, there are no specific details about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the roles and responsibilities of various individuals in a research project, including tasks such as writing, reviewing, editing, validation, supervision, resources, project administration, investigation, and data curation.

However, I can provide a general explanation of regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning:

Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning where a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are L2 regularization and dropout:

1. L2 regularization: Also known as weight decay, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the sum of the squares of the model's weights. This penalty term discourages the model from assigning too much importance to any single feature, leading to a simpler and more generalizable model.
2. Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the model's activations to zero during training. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron or connection, leading to a more robust and generalizable model.

These regularization techniques can be applied to various layers of a deep learning model, such as fully connected layers, convolutional layers, and recurrent layers, to prevent overfitting and improve the model's performance on unseen data.
