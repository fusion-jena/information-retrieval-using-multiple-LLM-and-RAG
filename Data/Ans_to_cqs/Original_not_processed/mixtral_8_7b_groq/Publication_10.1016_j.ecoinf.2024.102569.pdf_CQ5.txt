Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about deep learning pipelines or datasets commonly used in deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses ecological informatics, specifically the use of presence-only (PO) and presence-absence (PA) data in ecological studies. The text also mentions some ecological variables and data sources, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and platforms like eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org. However, these are not typically used as datasets in deep learning for computer vision tasks.

In summary, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline.
