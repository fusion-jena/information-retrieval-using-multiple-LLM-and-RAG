Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, there are some indications of techniques that could contribute to the model's generalizability.

Firstly, the authors explored and evaluated various parameter values, including learning rate, batch size, and latent dimension. This process of hyperparameter tuning can help to find a set of parameters that work well for the specific task and dataset, thereby improving the model's performance and generalizability.

Secondly, the authors used different regularization techniques, such as weight decay and dropout, during the training of the MLP. Regularization techniques can help to prevent overfitting, which is a common problem in machine learning that can reduce a model's ability to generalize to new data.

Thirdly, the authors used the Adam optimizer, which is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm. Adaptive learning rate algorithms can help to improve the convergence of the model during training and prevent overshooting, which can also contribute to the model's generalizability.

Finally, the authors used either Cross-Entropy or Focal Loss as the loss function during the training of the MLP. The choice of loss function can affect the model's performance and generalizability, as different loss functions can emphasize different aspects of the data and the task.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, there are indications of hyperparameter tuning, regularization techniques, adaptive learning rate optimization, and the choice of loss function. These techniques can all contribute to the model's ability to generalize to new data. However, without more information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer to the query.
