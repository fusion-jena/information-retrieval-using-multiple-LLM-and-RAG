Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the architecture proposed for the solution is based on modern IT infrastructure. Furthermore, it is noted that AWS Kinesis and Apache Kibana, which are available on platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), provide access to state-of-the-art machine learning methods for event-stream processing. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model could potentially be deployed on a platform like AWS, but the specific platform is not explicitly stated in the context.
