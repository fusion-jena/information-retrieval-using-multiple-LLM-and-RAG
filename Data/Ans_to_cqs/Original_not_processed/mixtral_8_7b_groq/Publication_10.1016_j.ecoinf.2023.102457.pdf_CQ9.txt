Answer:::

Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text discusses the use of pre-trained models like BirdNET, VGGish, and Wav2Vec 2.0, as well as the potential benefits of training a model on gibbon vocalizations. However, it does not specify where the data or code for this pipeline is stored or made available. It's possible that the data repository is not publicly accessible or was not included in the text provided. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
