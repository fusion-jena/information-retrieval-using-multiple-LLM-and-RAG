Answer:::

The provided context does not include a direct link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that "Data will be made available on request." This suggests that the data may be obtained by contacting the authors or the publication directly.

The CRediT authorship contribution statement lists several authors who were involved in data curation and validation, as well as software development. The corresponding authors for the paper are Xianghui Xu and Weijiang Kong, and their affiliations are provided in the context.

It is also worth noting that the paper includes references to several datasets used in the study, such as land use and land cover data for Lanzhou, China. These references may provide additional context and resources for researchers interested in the study.

Therefore, while a direct link to a data repository is not provided, there are several avenues for obtaining the data and related information for the deep learning pipeline used in the study.
