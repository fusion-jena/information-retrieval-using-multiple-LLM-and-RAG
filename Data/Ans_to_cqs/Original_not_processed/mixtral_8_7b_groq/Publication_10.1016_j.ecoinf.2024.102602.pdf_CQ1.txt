Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning in monitoring invasive alien plants, particularly in relation to data collection from citizen science and social media platforms. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

Based on the context, it can be inferred that data for deep learning models is collected through citizen science or social media platforms, which may involve public datasets. These platforms can provide big digital data, such as images and location information, that can be used for training deep learning models to detect and monitor invasive alien plants. Data acquisition can be facilitated through APIs or other scraping methods, although not all platforms allow data scraping due to terms and conditions of use.

Therefore, while the context does not provide a comprehensive list of methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it suggests that public datasets from citizen science and social media platforms are used for this purpose. Other methods, such as surveys and sensors, are not mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, based on the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include data acquisition from public datasets on citizen science and social media platforms. However, the context does not explicitly mention other methods such as surveys and sensors.
