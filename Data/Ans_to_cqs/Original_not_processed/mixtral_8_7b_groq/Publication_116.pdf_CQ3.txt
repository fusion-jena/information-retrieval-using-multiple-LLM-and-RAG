Answer:::
The provided context does not include specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for classifying leaf-scan images into species. However, it is mentioned that a deep learning approach is used in one of the two pipelines for image classification.

In general, for deep learning-based image classification tasks, data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation can be used.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image. This technique is commonly used for object detection tasks, where the goal is to locate and identify objects within an image.

Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with the class label of the object it belongs to. This technique is useful for image segmentation tasks, where the goal is to partition an image into multiple regions based on the objects present in the image.

Instance segmentation is a more advanced technique that involves not only labeling each pixel in an image with the class label of the object it belongs to but also distinguishing between individual instances of the same object class. This technique is useful for tasks where it is important to identify and distinguish between individual objects within an image.

Without specific information from the provided context, it is difficult to determine which of these data annotation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline for classifying leaf-scan images into species. However, it is possible that one or more of these techniques were used, depending on the specific requirements of the task.
