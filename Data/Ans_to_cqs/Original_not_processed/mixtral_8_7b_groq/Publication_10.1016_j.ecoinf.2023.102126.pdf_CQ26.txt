The provided context does not contain information about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Instead, it discusses the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles for research data and the use of evaluation tools like F-UJI to assess FAIRness.

FAIR principles aim to improve the management and sharing of digital research data. However, they do not directly address data bias during preprocessing of deep learning pipelines.

To answer the query, here are some common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing:

1. **Stratified sampling**: This technique involves dividing the data into subgroups based on specific criteria (like class labels) and then ensuring that each subgroup is proportionally represented in the training, validation, and test sets.

2. **Oversampling**: In cases where one class is underrepresented, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from that class, either by duplicating existing instances or by generating synthetic instances using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

3. **Undersampling**: When one class has a significantly larger number of instances than the other class, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of instances from the majority class, either by randomly removing instances or by using more sophisticated methods like Tomek links.

4. **Diverse data collection**: Collecting data from various sources, domains, and demographics can help reduce bias by ensuring that the dataset is representative of the target population.

These techniques can help improve the fairness and accuracy of deep learning models by reducing bias in the training data.
