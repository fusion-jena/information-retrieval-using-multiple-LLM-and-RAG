Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context is for feature extraction and classification. This model is used to contribute to larger data input for the future training of deep learning models, with the aim of overcoming current challenges in individual acoustic discrimination and achieving non-invasive monitoring of animal populations.

The deep learning model in question is a task-specific model architecture derived from the family of residual networks (ResNets) and has been used to extract embeddings from gibbon vocalizations. This model was pre-trained on a large dataset consisting of audio data from bird vocalizations, specifically from North American and European bird species. The model creates a mel-scale spectrogram and returns 1024 embeddings per 3-second audio sample.

The embeddings extracted using this deep learning model are then used for classification purposes. The mean and standard deviation of the embeddings are taken over the entire duration of the call, resulting in a feature vector that can be used to identify and distinguish between individual gibbons.

It is worth noting that while the deep learning model used in this study is a pre-trained model, the context suggests that training a model with data input of gibbon vocalizations could result in even better performance for individual gibbon discrimination. However, this would require a large dataset and is computationally costly.

In summary, the deep learning model in question is used for feature extraction and classification purposes, specifically for individual acoustic discrimination and monitoring of animal populations. The model is a pre-trained ResNet model that has been used to extract embeddings from gibbon vocalizations, which are then used to distinguish between individual gibbons.
