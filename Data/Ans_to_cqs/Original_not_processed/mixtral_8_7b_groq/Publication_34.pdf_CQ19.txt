Answer:::
The deep learning models in the study were built using the mxnet package, which is a C++ library for learning deep neural network (NN) models. The mxnet package is deployed as an R package, and it integrates a high level symbolic language for quickly building customized models and loss functions. It also automatically distributes calculations under CPUs or GPUs. However, the specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch were not mentioned in the provided context.
