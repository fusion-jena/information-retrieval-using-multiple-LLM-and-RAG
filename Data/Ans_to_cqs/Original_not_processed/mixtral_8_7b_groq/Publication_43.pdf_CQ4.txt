Answer:::

Data augmentation techniques are used in the deep learning pipeline to artificially increase the number of samples in the training set by applying specific deformations on the input images. These techniques help improve the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and make them robust to changes in scales, brightness, and geometrical distortions.

Some common data augmentation techniques include:

1. Flipping: This involves horizontally or vertically flipping the input images. Flipping an image horizontally can help the CNN model learn features that are invariant to direction, such as the shape of an object.

2. Rotation: Rotating the input images by a certain angle can help the CNN model learn features that are invariant to orientation. This can be particularly useful for object detection tasks where the orientation of the object in the image may vary.

3. Scaling: Scaling the input images up or down can help the CNN model learn features that are invariant to size. This can be useful for tasks where the size of the object in the image may vary.

4. Translation: Translating the input images, or shifting them horizontally or vertically, can help the CNN model learn features that are invariant to position. This can be useful for tasks where the position of the object in the image may vary.

5. Brightness changes: Changing the brightness of the input images can help the CNN model learn features that are invariant to lighting conditions. This can be useful for tasks where the lighting conditions in the image may vary.

These data augmentation techniques can be applied to the training set to create a much larger dataset of transformed images that are still meaningful for the case study. The set of valid transformations that improves the performance of the CNN-model depends on the particularities of the problem.

In summary, data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, scaling, translation, and brightness changes are commonly used in the deep learning pipeline to improve the performance of CNN models and make them robust to changes in scales, brightness, and geometrical distortions.
