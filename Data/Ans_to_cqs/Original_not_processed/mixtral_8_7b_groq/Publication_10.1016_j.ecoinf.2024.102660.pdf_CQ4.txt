Answer:::
In the described deep learning pipeline, the data augmentation techniques applied include random rotations, flips, and other image augmentation operations. However, the context does not provide specific details about the "other" image augmentation operations or the degree of rotation and flipping.

The primary goal of applying these techniques is to enhance the network's robustness, allowing it to generalize better and make more accurate predictions on unseen data. By applying random transformations to the input images, the model is forced to learn more invariant features, which ultimately improves its performance and reduces overfitting.

The Res_AUNet network is trained for 120 epochs with a batch size of 8. During the training process, a portion of the input images undergoes random rotations, flips, and other augmentation operations. These techniques help the model to better handle variations in water sun glint patterns and improve its ability to detect sun glint in UAV water images.

In summary, the data augmentation techniques applied in this deep learning pipeline include random rotations, flips, and other unspecified image augmentation operations. These techniques contribute to the network's robustness and ability to generalize, leading to improved performance in detecting water sun glint in UAV water images.
