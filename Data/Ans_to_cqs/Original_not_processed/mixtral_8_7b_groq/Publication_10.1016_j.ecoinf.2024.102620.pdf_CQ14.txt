The text provided does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the PLUS model, CASA model, or other mentioned models are optimized. There is no explicit mention of methods such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization techniques.

The text does provide details about the models' workings and the values of certain parameters, but the process of hyperparameter optimization is not discussed. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to the query.

It's important to note that hyperparameter optimization is a crucial step in machine learning model development to ensure the best performance. Techniques like grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, or even manual tuning can be used for this purpose. However, the specific method used for the models in question is not mentioned in the text.
