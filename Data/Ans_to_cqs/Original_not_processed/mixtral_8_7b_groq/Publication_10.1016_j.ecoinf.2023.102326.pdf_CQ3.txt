The provided context discusses research on the urban acoustic environment (AE) and the use of machine learning for sound event classification, but it does not directly mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

However, it is possible to infer some related concepts based on the context. For instance, the authors use a method called "feature clustering" to group similar sound events together. This process involves converting raw audio data into a set of features, such as pitch, loudness, or spectral entropy, and then using clustering algorithms to group similar feature vectors together. This can be seen as a form of data annotation, where each cluster represents a distinct sound event.

In addition, the authors use a technique called "thresholding" to identify individual sound events within each cluster. This involves setting a threshold value for each feature, and any data point that falls above that threshold is considered to be part of a sound event. This can be seen as a form of bounding box annotation, where the threshold values define the boundaries of each sound event.

The authors also use a method called "adjacency matrix" to represent the relationships between different sound events. This involves creating a matrix where each row and column represents a different sound event, and the value in each cell represents the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between the corresponding sound events. This can be seen as a form of instance segmentation, where each sound event is represented as a distinct instance in the matrix.

Overall, while the provided context does not directly mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, it does describe related methods such as feature clustering, thresholding, and adjacency matrix that can be used to annotate and segment sound data.
