The provided text discusses the use of deep learning models for image classification, specifically for marine images and coral reefs. However, it does not explicitly mention any strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value.

In general, deep learning models often involve randomness during various stages of the training process, such as the initialization of weights and biases, the selection of mini-batches for stochastic gradient descent, and the use of dropout regularization. A fixed random seed value can be set to ensure reproducibility of results and control the sources of randomness in the model.

In the context of the provided text, the authors mention using pre-trained VGGnet models and fine-tuning them on a specific dataset. During the fine-tuning process, the authors could have used a fixed random seed value to ensure consistent initialization of weights and biases, as well as consistent mini-batch selection. However, the text does not explicitly mention this.

In summary, while the provided text does not discuss specific strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is common practice to use a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility and control randomness during various stages of deep learning model training.
