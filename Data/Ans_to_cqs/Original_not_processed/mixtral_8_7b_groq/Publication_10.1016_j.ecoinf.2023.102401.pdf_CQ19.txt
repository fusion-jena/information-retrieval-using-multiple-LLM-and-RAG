Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework was used to build the YWnet network. Deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch are commonly used for building and training neural networks. However, based on the information available, it is not possible to definitively determine which of these two or any other framework was used in the development of the YWnet model.
