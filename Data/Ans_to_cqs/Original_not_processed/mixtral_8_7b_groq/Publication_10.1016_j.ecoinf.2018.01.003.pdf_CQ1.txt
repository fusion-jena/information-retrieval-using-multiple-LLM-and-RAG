Answer:

The provided context does not contain specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the application of deep learning and other machine learning models in various fields such as ecological economics, time series forecasting, and urban total ecological footprint forecasting.

In the study by Leng et al. (2017), they used public datasets of airborne particle-bound metals to predict the size-fractionated airborne particle-bound metals using mlr, bp-ann, and svm analyses. This suggests that public datasets can be used as raw data in deep learning applications.

In the studies by Li et al. (2010, 2014), they used data related to land use, population, and economic activities to calculate the ecological footprint of Wuhan City, China and a typical steppe region in China. This data could have been collected through surveys, sensors, or public databases.

In the context, there is no mention of using sensors or surveys specifically for collecting raw data in deep learning. However, it is mentioned that the deep learning algorithm breaks the limitation of the traditional neural network on the number of layers, allowing for the extraction of deeply hidden characteristic information and features from large-scale data. This implies that deep learning can handle various types of data, which can be collected through different methods.

Therefore, it can be inferred that raw data for deep learning can be collected through various methods such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets, depending on the specific application and availability of data.
