After the model training process, there are several postprocessing steps that can be involved, such as generating saliency maps, calculating various metrics, and creating a confusion matrix. However, the specific steps are not mentioned in the provided context.

In the context, it is mentioned that the ensemble prediction was generated using a weighted-averaging approach based on the predictive accuracy of individual models. The performance of both individual models and the ensemble model was evaluated using two widely recognized metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS). AUC values were categorized as excellent, good, moderate, or poor, while TSS values were categorized as excellent, good, or poor. This evaluation process provides insights into the model performance, but it is not a postprocessing step after the model training.

Moreover, the context discusses the modelling landscape resistance, but it does not mention any postprocessing steps after the model training. The authors mention the use of active remote sensing and data fusion for characterizing forest in wildlife habitat models, as well as the use of multi-scale resource selection functions from two geographic areas to improve habitat and connectivity model predictions. However, these are related to the model training process rather than postprocessing steps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are not explicitly mentioned. The context focuses on the model training process, the evaluation of model performance, and the modelling landscape resistance.
