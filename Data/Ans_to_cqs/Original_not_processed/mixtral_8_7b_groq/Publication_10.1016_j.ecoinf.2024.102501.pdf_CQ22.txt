Answer:::

The performance of the deep learning model, in the context provided, is evaluated using the coefficients of determination (R2), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The R2 score, which is a percentage, indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. A higher R2 score implies a better fit of the model to the data. On the other hand, MSE and MAE are measures of the average magnitude of the errors in the model's predictions. MSE squares the errors before they are averaged, which gives more weight to large errors, while MAE takes the absolute value of the errors before they are averaged, treating all errors equally. Therefore, a lower MSE or MAE indicates better performance of the model. These metrics are used to compare the performance of the WTD-GWO-SVR model with other models such as WTD-SVR, LSTM, and BPNN in predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration.
