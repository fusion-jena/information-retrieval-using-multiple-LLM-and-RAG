Answer:::

The types of deep learning models used in the provided context are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), which are both variants of neural networks.

CNNs are commonly used in computer vision tasks and are known for their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from images. In the context, CNNs are used in conjunction with class activation maps to identify the most discriminative regions used to identify a class. This is demonstrated in the work by Zhou et al. (2016) and Marcos et al. (2019).

On the other hand, LSTMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that are well-suited for processing sequential data. They are particularly useful in natural language processing and time series prediction tasks. In the context, LSTMs are used in the work by Arras et al. (2019) to provide better results than gradient-based sensitivity analysis in a five-class prediction task.

Therefore, both CNNs and LSTMs are used in the deep learning pipelines discussed in the provided context. CNNs are mainly used for image-based tasks, while LSTMs are used for sequential data tasks.
