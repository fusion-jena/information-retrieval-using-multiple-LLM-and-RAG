Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context mainly focuses on the training process, evaluation metrics, and some considerations regarding the training data.

However, it is common practice to calculate various metrics and create visualizations like confusion matrices and saliency maps as part of the postprocessing steps to evaluate the model's performance better.

Metrics calculation usually includes precision, recall, F1 score, Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (mAP), and others, depending on the specific task. These metrics have been mentioned in the context as part of the training evaluation.

A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model (or "classifier") on a set of test data for which the true values are known. It allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm.

Saliency maps are a way to visualize the parts of the input that are most important for the output of a deep learning model. They can be used to debug models, understand how they make decisions, and improve their performance.

Given that these are common practices in model evaluation, it is reasonable to assume that they might have been applied after training the model in this case as well. However, the context does not provide specific information to confirm this.
