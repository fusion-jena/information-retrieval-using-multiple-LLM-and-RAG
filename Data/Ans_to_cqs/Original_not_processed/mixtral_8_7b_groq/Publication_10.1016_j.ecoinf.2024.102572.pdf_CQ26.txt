The provided context discusses the use of machine learning techniques for land use and land cover data analysis, specifically in the context of fire-damaged monuments and quantifying carbon emissions from forest fires. However, it does not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.

That being said, some common techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified sampling: This technique involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain criteria, and then ensuring that each subgroup is proportionally represented in both the training and testing datasets. This can help to ensure that the model is trained on a diverse and representative sample of the data.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of examples from underrepresented classes in the training dataset. This can help to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of examples from overrepresented classes in the training dataset. This can also help to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population or problem being studied. This can help to ensure that the model is trained on a diverse and unbiased sample of the data.

It is important to note that, while these techniques can help to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, they are not a substitute for careful and thoughtful data collection and analysis. It is essential to consider the potential sources of bias in the data and to take steps to mitigate them throughout the entire data analysis process.
