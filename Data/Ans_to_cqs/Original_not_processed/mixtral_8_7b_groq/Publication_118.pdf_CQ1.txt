Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the research focuses on eco-acoustic data analysis, which involves soundscape recordings.

Eco-acoustic data is typically collected using various types of sensors, such as microphones, hydrophones, or accelerometers, placed in the environment to capture sound signals. These sensors can be deployed for different durations, ranging from short-term recordings to long-term monitoring. Researchers may also use existing public datasets of eco-acoustic recordings, which can be found in various repositories or platforms.

In this specific study, the authors used a dataset of audio spectrograms, which were likely obtained through soundscape recordings. However, the context does not provide information on how the dataset was created or collected.

To summarize, eco-acoustic data for deep learning applications is commonly collected using sensors or obtained from public datasets. The specific method used in this study is not mentioned in the provided context.
