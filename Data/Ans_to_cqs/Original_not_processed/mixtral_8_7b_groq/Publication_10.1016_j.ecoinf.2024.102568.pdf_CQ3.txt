Answer:::

The provided context does not contain specific information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of deep learning models for air quality prediction.

In the context, the LSTM model is used for time series prediction of air quality. The model is trained using the mean squared error (MSE) as a loss function and the ADAM optimization algorithm. A dropout layer is added to the model to avoid overfitting, which is a regularization method that randomly excludes some inputs from activation and weight updates while training a network.

The dataset used for training the LSTM model is pre-processed using a MinMaxScaler that transforms each feature by scaling it to a [0-1] range. The temporal window dimension is selected dynamically based on the performance obtained with different values on the available dataset.

In the specific case of Modena, an Italian city spanning 183 km2, two legal AQ stations are used for data collection. The past values of the air quality indices have decreasing trends. The LSTM model is compared with different RNN architectures such as Multilayer Perceptron and Gate Recurrent Unit.

Therefore, while the context does not provide information on data annotation techniques, it does provide insights into the deep learning pipeline for time series prediction of air quality.
