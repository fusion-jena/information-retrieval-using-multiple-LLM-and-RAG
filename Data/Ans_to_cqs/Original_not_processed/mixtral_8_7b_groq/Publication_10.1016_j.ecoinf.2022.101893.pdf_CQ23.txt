Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, the context does mention that the datasets are divided into training and test sets according to an 8:2 ratio, which is a common practice in machine learning to assess the performance of a model on unseen data. Additionally, the classification models are built with the training set, and accuracy on the test set is used as an indicator to evaluate the performance of the classification models. This approach allows for an estimation of how well the model has learned to generalize from the training data to new, unseen data.

Furthermore, the context also mentions that different features (F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, and Fdh) are used as inputs to the CNN model, and their classification performance on the test set is evaluated. This approach can be seen as a simple form of implicit data augmentation, which can help improve the model's ability to generalize.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, it does describe the use of a training-test split and the evaluation of the model's performance on different features as potential ways to assess the model's generalizability.
