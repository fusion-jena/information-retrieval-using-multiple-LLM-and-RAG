Answer:::

The data format used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context is a tabulated CSV file. The training dataset consists of 268 sample plots with 39 features, which are stored in a tabular format in a CSV file. These features are likely represented as different columns in the CSV file, and each sample plot corresponds to a row in the file.

It is important to note that the data used in this study is not image, audio, or video data, which are also common data formats used in deep learning pipelines. Instead, the data is collected from sample plots and processed to generate a tabulated dataset, which includes on-field Aboveground Biomass (AGB) and independent features.

The tabulated dataset is then fed into hybrid models, where Bayesian optimizers and Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TDO) tune the hyperparameters of XGBoost and LightGBM using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as the objective function. The best model, which is the one with the smallest RMSE, is then selected to estimate AGB for the entire study area.

Therefore, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is a tabulated CSV file containing 39 features of 268 sample plots.
