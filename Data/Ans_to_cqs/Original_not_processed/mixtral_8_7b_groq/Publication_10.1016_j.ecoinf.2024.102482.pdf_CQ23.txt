Based on the information given, specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, were not detailed. However, some aspects of the model design can be inferred to contribute to the model's ability to generalize.

Answer:::
The model's feature extraction process involves using the BLS entropy profile to characterize the swimming behavior of C. elegans. This method has been used to calculate the Levenshtein distance, which helps identify similarities and differences in swimming patterns in various environments (Jeong et al., 2019; Kang et al., not provided). Using this consistent feature extraction method across different datasets could help maintain the model's generalizability.

Additionally, the model structure was designed to be simple and efficient, consisting of an input layer, three LSTM hidden layers, a dropout layer, and a dense layer. This structure aims to balance performance and efficiency, enabling real-time predictions on devices with limited computing power. A simpler model may be less prone to overfitting, which can improve its ability to generalize to new data.

Furthermore, the proposed model can be combined with a Graph Neural Network (GNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, creating a hybrid model. This hybrid model can incorporate information from a UBN (a kind of graph) representing the swimming behavior of C. elegans, such as distinguishing the head and tail or the direction of movement. By using more comprehensive information, the model may achieve better accuracy and maintain its generalizability.

In summary, while specific measures like cross-validation or stratified splitting are not mentioned, the consistent feature extraction method, simple model structure, and potential hybrid model design may contribute to the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, without explicit information on these measures, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.
