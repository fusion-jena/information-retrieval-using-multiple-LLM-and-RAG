The provided context does not include specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention the use of ROIs (Regions of Interest) in the context of a study on soundscape classification with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). ROIs are often used as a form of labeled training data in image-based deep learning tasks.

In addition, the context mentions the use of transfer learning, which involves using pre-trained models on large datasets (such as ImageNet) and fine-tuning them on a smaller, specific dataset. This technique is often used to improve performance when the amount of labeled data in the study domain is limited.

The study also mentions the use of weakly-labeled audio data from the BirdCLEF competition, which is a challenge focused on bird sound recognition.

Answer::: The provided context does not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, but it does mention the use of ROIs, transfer learning, and weakly-labeled audio data from the BirdCLEF competition.
