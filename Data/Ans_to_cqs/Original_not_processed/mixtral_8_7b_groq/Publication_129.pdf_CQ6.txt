Answer:::
While the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model, it does give some insight into the process of creating a deep learning model for agricultural pests recognition.

The first step mentioned is the use of a pre-trained CNN architecture, such as Inception, Residual Neural Network (Resnet), or Dense Convolutional Network (Densenet), as the backbone feature extractor. These architectures have been pre-trained on large datasets, like ImageNet, and can extract useful features from input images.

Next, the Region Proposal Network (RPN) module proposes object locations of the feature maps generated by the backbone feature extractor. This step may involve some preprocessing, such as resizing the input images to a specific size or aspect ratio, as required by the chosen feature extractor.

After the RPN module, a regressor and classifier are trained using a loss function. This step might require data normalization or scaling to ensure the model's stability and convergence during training. However, the context does not provide specific details about these preprocessing steps.

The Region of Interest (RoI) pooling layer takes the region corresponding to a proposal from the backbone feature map and divides it into sub-windows. This step does not necessarily involve preprocessing, but it does require the input feature maps to be of a specific size and format.

Finally, the classifier calculates the probability of the region proposal containing an object, and the regions with the top scores are considered detected target objects. This step might involve some preprocessing, such as one-hot encoding of class labels or thresholding of probability scores.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning, it does imply that some preprocessing might be necessary for resizing input images, normalizing or scaling data, and encoding class labels. However, the context does not provide specific details about these preprocessing steps.
