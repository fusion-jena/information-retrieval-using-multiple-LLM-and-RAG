Based on the provided context, the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for predicting Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD) are not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer that the data used in the study includes weather parameters such as minimum, maximum, and average temperature, standard meteorological week (SMW)-wise growing degree days (GDD), minimum and maximum relative humidity, average relative humidity, cumulative rainfall, and whitefly count per three leaves.

It can be assumed that the weather parameters were collected using sensors or weather stations located at the four study locations in the north-western zone (Faridkot, Sriganganagar, Sirsa, and Hisar). The whitefly count per three leaves might have been obtained through visual surveys or inspections of cotton plants. However, the study does not provide detailed information on the data collection methods.

In general, for deep learning pipelines, raw data can be collected using various methods, including but not limited to:

1. Surveys: Collecting data through questionnaires, interviews, or observations.
2. Sensors: Using sensors or IoT devices to collect real-time data on various parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, etc.
3. Public datasets: Utilizing publicly available datasets such as those provided by government agencies, research institutions, or other organizations.
4. Private datasets: Using privately owned datasets collected by companies or organizations for their specific purposes.

The choice of data collection method depends on the specific problem being addressed, the availability and accessibility of data, and the resources available for data collection.
