Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the described deep learning pipeline. The IUC-NN algorithm is a deep neural network model developed to predict the conservation status of orchid species using occurrence records and other relevant features. However, the text does not discuss any data augmentation techniques being used during the training of the IUC-NN model.

The dataset used for training the IUC-NN model consists of orchid species with IUCN Red List assessments and available occurrence records. The dataset is split into a training set (90%) and a test set (10%), with 20% of the training set used for validation. Cross-validation is performed by shifting the validation set 5 times to quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy.

The features used for training the model include geographic, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic variables. However, there is no information about data augmentation techniques being applied to these features.

Answer:::

In summary, while the provided context describes a deep learning pipeline for predicting the conservation status of orchid species, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in this pipeline.
