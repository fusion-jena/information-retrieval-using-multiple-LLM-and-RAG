Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning (DL) in the field of biodiversity monitoring, with a focus on reducing the amount of wildlife data reviewed by human analysts. However, the context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the DL pipeline.

That being said, there are several common techniques used to address data bias in DL, which could also be applied during the preprocessing phase. These techniques include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain characteristics, and then ensuring that each subgroup is represented proportionally in both the training and testing sets. This can help to ensure that the model is exposed to a diverse range of data during training.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of a particular class in the training set, in order to balance out an imbalance in class distribution. This can help to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class in the training set, in order to balance out an imbalance in class distribution. This can help to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a wide range of sources, in order to ensure that the model is exposed to a diverse range of data during training. This can help to prevent the model from being biased towards a particular subset of the data.

It's important to note that these techniques are not mutually exclusive and can be used in combination to address data bias. Additionally, it's important to consider the specific characteristics of the dataset and the problem at hand when deciding which techniques to use.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the DL pipeline, common techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These techniques can help to ensure that the model is exposed to a diverse range of data during training, and prevent it from being biased towards a particular subset of the data.
