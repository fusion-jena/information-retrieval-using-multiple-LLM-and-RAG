Answer:

The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or any code repository links. The text focuses on the data platform used for monitoring H. halys, a type of insect, and the sources of data used in this platform. The data sources include a monitoring network, satellite images, weather data, and environmental data, with details about the providers, update frequencies, granularity, and size of each source. The data is then validated and loaded to the Access tier through an incremental ETL procedure.

There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or any code repository links, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
