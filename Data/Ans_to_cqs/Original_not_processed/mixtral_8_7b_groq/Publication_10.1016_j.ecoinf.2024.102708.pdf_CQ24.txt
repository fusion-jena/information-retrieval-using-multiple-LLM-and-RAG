Answer:::

The text provided does not directly discuss strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation, which can introduce a form of controlled randomness to improve model performance.

In the context of this article, data augmentation is applied to the training dataset to increase its size and help the model generalize better. The augmentations include flipping, cropping, contrast shift, translation, and rotation. By applying these transformations randomly to the training data, the model is exposed to a variety of patterns and variations, which can help it learn more robust features and reduce overfitting.

While the text does not explicitly mention a random seed value, it is important to note that setting a specific seed value can help ensure reproducibility in deep learning models. By fixing the seed value, the random number generator used in the model will produce the same sequence of random numbers, leading to consistent weight initializations, data splits, and other random processes during training. This can be crucial for comparing different models, tuning hyperparameters, or replicating experiments.

In summary, although the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of data augmentation as a technique to improve model performance. Additionally, while not explicitly mentioned, setting a random seed value is an essential strategy for ensuring reproducibility in deep learning models.
