Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). This is evident from the context provided, where it's mentioned that a DCNN is used for semantic segmentation in the study. Additionally, the specific base network used is Deeplabv3-Resnet101, which is a type of DCNN. The network uses convolution layers from Deeplabv3-Resnet101 as a learned feature extractor and attaches a classification head for predicting the class of each pixel. The cross-entropy loss function is used for training this DCNN.
