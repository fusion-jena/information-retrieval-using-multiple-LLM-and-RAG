Answer:::

The text provided does not give explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the training process might be using a validation loss plateau or a similar concept as a stopping criterion.

In typical machine learning tasks, training a model involves iteratively adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the error on the training data. A common practice is to monitor the model's performance on a separate validation set during the training process. If the model's performance on the validation set (e.g., validation loss) does not improve for a certain number of iterations or epochs, the training process is likely to be stopped to prevent overfitting. This is often referred to as early stopping.

In the context of the text, it is mentioned that the dataset for each period was divided into training, testing, and validation sets in a ratio of 70:20:10, respectively. This suggests that a validation set was used during the model training process. Furthermore, the text mentions the use of the sklearn library for accuracy calculation, which is a popular machine learning library in Python that supports early stopping and other convergence criteria.

Therefore, while the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete are not specified in the text, it can be reasonably assumed that a validation loss plateau or a similar concept was used as a stopping criterion in the training process.
