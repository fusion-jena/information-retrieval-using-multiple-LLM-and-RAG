Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on describing the architecture and design of a specific deep learning network (ICSNet) and comparing it to other existing networks like LeNet, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet. It includes details about the layers used in ICSNet, the activation functions, and the size of the output results. However, it does not mention any information about the data repository or where the data used in this study can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
