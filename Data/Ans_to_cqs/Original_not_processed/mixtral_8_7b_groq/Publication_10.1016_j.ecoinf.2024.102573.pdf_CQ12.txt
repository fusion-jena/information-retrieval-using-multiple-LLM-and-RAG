The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models for bird species recognition through bioacoustic analysis. However, it does not explicitly specify the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.

The context does mention the use of convolutional networks (CNNs) in some works, such as Xie et al. (Xie and Zhu, 2019), where they trained a convolutional network directly on the Constant-Q Transform (CQT) and found it to be the best choice among the features tested. Additionally, other contemporary works have explored various types of neural networks as species recognizers by leveraging Short-Time Fourier-Transform (STFT) or its relatives, such as mel-filterbanks applied on STFT (mel-spectrogram) and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) as input features.

However, the context also discusses the potential of using the waveform as raw input to neural networks, stating that data processing inequality indicates that post-processing cannot increase a signal's information. This suggests that other types of deep learning models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers, could also be considered as alternatives for processing the waveform data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that CNNs have been used in some related works, but the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly specified. Other models, such as RNNs or Transformers, could also be considered for processing waveform data.

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly specified in the provided context. However, some related works have used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by training them directly on time-frequency representations such as Constant-Q Transform (CQT) or using mel-filterbanks applied on Short-Time Fourier-Transform (STFT) or Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) as input features. The context also suggests the potential of using other deep learning models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers, by processing the waveform data directly.
