Based on the provided context, there are no explicit details mentioned regarding the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it is generally common practice to perform certain preprocessing techniques before training deep learning models. These steps may include data cleaning, normalization, and scaling.

Data cleaning involves handling missing or corrupted data points in the dataset. This could be done by imputing missing values, removing corrupted data, or using techniques like interpolation or regression to estimate missing values.

Normalization and scaling are important preprocessing steps for deep learning models, especially when dealing with numerical data. Normalization involves rescaling the data to a common range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling, on the other hand, involves rescaling the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. These steps help ensure that all features have equal importance during training and prevent any single feature from dominating the learning process.

In the context of land use change and ecological security pattern modeling, the provided articles discuss various models and techniques used for predicting and analyzing land use changes. For instance, the LSTM model, a deep learning model, is used for predicting time series data in land use change. However, the specific preprocessing steps taken before training the LSTM model are not mentioned.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, it is generally recommended to perform data cleaning, normalization, and scaling as part of the preprocessing pipeline.
