Answer:::
The provided context does not include specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. The text focuses on pixel-based and object-based classifications using traditional machine learning techniques like CART, RF, GTB, and SVM. It explains how hyperparameters were tuned for these models using validation data. However, it does not mention any details about the deep learning model's hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, or any other parameters that might be used in a deep learning model, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query based on the given context.
