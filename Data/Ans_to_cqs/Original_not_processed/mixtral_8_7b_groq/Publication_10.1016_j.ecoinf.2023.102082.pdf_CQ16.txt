Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the criteria used to determine when the training of the Potapov30m model is complete. However, it is mentioned that the model was developed using a regression tree algorithm and validated using ALS data, resulting in a ME of 3.8 m, RMSE of 9.07 m, and MAE of 6.36 m.

In general, when training a machine learning model, it is common to monitor the performance on a validation set during the training process. The training process typically involves minimizing a loss function, and the validation set is used to check how well the model generalizes to new data. When the validation loss stops decreasing or starts increasing, even though the training loss is still decreasing, it is an indication that the model is starting to overfit to the training data. At this point, the training can be considered complete.

In the case of the Potapov30m model, it is possible that the authors used a similar approach to determine when the training was complete. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.

It is also worth noting that the Potapov30m model was derived from GEDI, Landsat, and SRTM data and validated using ALS data, all of which are remote sensing data sources. The training process for models based on remote sensing data can be more complex than for models based on other types of data, as the remote sensing data often has noise and other sources of uncertainty that need to be taken into account. Therefore, the criteria used to determine when the training is complete for remote sensing models may be different from those used for other types of models.
