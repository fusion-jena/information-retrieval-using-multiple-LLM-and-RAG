Based on the provided context, there is no clear information that specifies the exact platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) used to deploy the deep learning models for bulk arthropod abundance, biomass, and diversity estimation. The articles focus on the methodology, datasets, and applications of deep learning in arthropod research. They mention the use of computational resources but do not explicitly state the platform used. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
