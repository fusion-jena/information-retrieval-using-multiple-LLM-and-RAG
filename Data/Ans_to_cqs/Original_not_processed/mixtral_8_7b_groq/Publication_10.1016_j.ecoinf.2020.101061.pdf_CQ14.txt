Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the evaluation of models for predicting tree conditions using LiDAR data, but it does not mention any specific methods for hyperparameter tuning such as grid search, random search, or others. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
