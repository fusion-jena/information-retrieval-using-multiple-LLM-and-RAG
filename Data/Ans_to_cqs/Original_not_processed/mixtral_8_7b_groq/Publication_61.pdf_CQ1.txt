Answer:::
In the deep learning pipeline, the method for collecting raw data is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the authors built their own dataset due to the lack of previous information. The dataset they built is for cactus recognition in aerial images, and they suggest improving the current accuracy by including more examples in the dataset, obtained under different conditions such as different daylight conditions or different year seasons. This implies that the data was collected either through aerial photography or satellite imagery. Therefore, based on the context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline are likely aerial photography or satellite imagery.
