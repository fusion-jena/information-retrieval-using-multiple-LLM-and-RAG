The provided context does not contain information about the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It mainly focuses on the use of GPU computing in various applications, particularly in machine learning, and the proportion of compute time spent on different tasks within the bootstrap filter.

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning pipelines, raw data can be collected using various methods such as:

1. Surveys: These are structured sets of questions designed to gather information from a sample of individuals or organizations. Surveys can be conducted in various ways, including online, on paper, or through face-to-face interviews.

2. Sensors: These are devices that measure physical or chemical quantities and convert them into signals that can be read by humans or machines. Sensors can be used to collect data in various fields, including environmental monitoring, healthcare, and transportation.

3. Public datasets: These are collections of data that are publicly available and can be used for research or other purposes. Public datasets can be found in various domains, including government, science, and industry.

An example of data collection in the provided context is the use of acoustic recordings in Nanni et al. (2020) for animal audio classification. In this case, the raw data is the sound recordings, which are then processed and analyzed using deep learning techniques.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly answer the query, it is possible to infer that raw data in deep learning pipelines can be collected using various methods, including surveys, sensors, and public datasets.
