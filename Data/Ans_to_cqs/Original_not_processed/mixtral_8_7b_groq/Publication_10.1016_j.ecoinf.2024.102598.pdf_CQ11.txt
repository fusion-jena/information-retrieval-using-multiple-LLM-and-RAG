Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct information given about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, the document by Bj√•nes, A., De La Fuente, R., Mena, P., (2021) titled "A deep learning ensemble model for wildfire susceptibility mapping" discusses a deep learning model for wildfire susceptibility mapping. The authors used AMS (Active Micro-scale Splitting) dataset for training and testing their model. However, they did not mention any data repository link for their model or dataset.

In addition, the document by Gupta, P., Shukla, D.P., (2022) titled "Google earth engine based temporal analysis of indices susceptibility mapping" discusses a Google Earth Engine (GEE) based temporal analysis of indices for wildfire susceptibility mapping. The authors used MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) dataset for their analysis. However, they did not mention any data repository link for their dataset.

Therefore, I am unable to provide the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the given context.
