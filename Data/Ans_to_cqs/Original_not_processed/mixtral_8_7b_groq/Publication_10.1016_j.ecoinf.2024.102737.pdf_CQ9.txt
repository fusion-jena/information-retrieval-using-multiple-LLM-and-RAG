Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The article "Improving deep learning based bluespotted ribbontail ray (Taeniura Lymma) recognition" discusses the use of a fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for marine animal recognition, specifically the bluespotted ribbontail ray. The authors mention that the CNN outperforms traditional classification methods, but there is no information on where the data used in the study is stored or shared.

The authors do mention several papers that they have referenced in their work, such as "Data-efficient online classification with siamese networks and active learning" by Malialis et al., and "Bio-indicator species and their role in monitoring water pollution" by Manzoor et al. However, these papers do not provide information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study is not available or mentioned.
