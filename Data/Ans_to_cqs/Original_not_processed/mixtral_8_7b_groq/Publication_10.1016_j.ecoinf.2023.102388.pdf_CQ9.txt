Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the details of the deep learning pipeline, such as the architecture of VGG16, the training process, and the fine-tuning techniques used for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). However, it does not mention where the data repository is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
