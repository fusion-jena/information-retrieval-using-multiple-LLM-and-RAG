Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of a data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text only states that the "half-hour temporal resolution flux tower data for all variables used in this study is available with Dr. Sandipan Mukherjee and the competent authorities of G. B. Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment, Almora, Uttarakhand, India."

Therefore, it appears that the data is not publicly available in a repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Instead, it seems that interested parties would need to contact Dr. Mukherjee and the relevant authorities at G. B. Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment to request access to the data.

It's worth noting that making research data publicly available in a repository is a best practice in many fields, as it promotes transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration. However, there may be valid reasons for not making data publicly available, such as ethical or legal considerations.

In summary, while the data used in the study is available upon request, there is no public data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
