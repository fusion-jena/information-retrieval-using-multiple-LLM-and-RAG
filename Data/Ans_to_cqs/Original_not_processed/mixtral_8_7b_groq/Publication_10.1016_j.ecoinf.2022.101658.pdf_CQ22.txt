Answer:::
The specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are not mentioned explicitly in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that accuracy, precision, and recall are among the possible metrics used.

The context states that the deep learning model's performance is affected by the loss function being biased toward overrepresented classes, which implies that the model's accuracy is a concern. Accuracy is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models, and it measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made.

Additionally, the context mentions that the model's results were statistically significant, which suggests that the model's precision and recall were also evaluated. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made, while recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.

Therefore, it can be concluded that accuracy, precision, and recall are likely the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the study. However, it is important to note that other metrics could have also been used, and the specific metrics used are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
