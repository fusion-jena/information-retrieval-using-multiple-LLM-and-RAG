Answer:::
Deep learning models, such as Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN), are prone to overfitting when trained on extensive datasets. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function, which encourages the model to be simpler and make more generalized predictions.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines are L2 regularization and dropout.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This penalty term discourages large weights, which are more likely to cause overfitting. By adding this term, the model is forced to distribute the importance of features more evenly, reducing the risk of overfitting.

Dropout is another regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the model's outputs to zero during training. This forces the model to learn redundant representations of the data, reducing its dependence on any single feature. By doing so, dropout prevents overfitting by promoting the learning of more generalized features.

In summary, L2 regularization and dropout are two common regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that discourages large weights, while dropout randomly sets a fraction of the model's outputs to zero during training, promoting the learning of more generalized features.
