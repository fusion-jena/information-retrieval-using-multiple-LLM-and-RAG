Based on the provided context, there are no specific details about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the automated recognition software comparison. However, in machine learning and deep learning models, a common criterion used to determine when training is complete is when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly. This means that the model's performance on the validation dataset has stabilized, and continuing to train the model may not improve its performance or could even lead to overfitting.

In the context of the provided text, the training and evaluation of the software are focused on comparing the recall rate and the percentage of occurrences detected using BirdNET and Kaleidoscope Pro. The validation dataset is used to assess the performance of these software, but there is no information on how the training of these models is determined to be complete.

It is important to note that the choice of criteria to determine when training is complete depends on the specific problem, dataset, and model being used. Other criteria that could be used include early stopping based on a patience parameter, monitoring other metrics such as accuracy or F1 score, or using a separate test dataset to evaluate the model's performance.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give specific details on the criteria used to determine when training is complete, it is common practice in machine learning to use a validation loss plateau or other metrics to determine when training is complete.
