Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text does not mention any specific techniques such as grid search, random search, or others for hyperparameter tuning. It mainly focuses on discussing the performance of the full model, which combines self-supervised and hand-annotated datasets, and its ability to segment large trees and under-segment small clusters of trees.

The sources cited in the text discuss various methods for segmenting individual trees from LiDAR point cloud data, imputation of individual longleaf pine tree attributes, and airborne LiDAR data manipulation for forestry applications. However, none of these sources provide information on the hyperparameter optimization process for the model in question.

In summary, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a specific answer regarding the hyperparameter optimization techniques used for the model.
