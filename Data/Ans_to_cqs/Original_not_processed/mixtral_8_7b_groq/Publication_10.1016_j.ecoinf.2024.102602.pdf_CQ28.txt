Answer:::
The provided context does not specify the platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of open-source Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0. The models were optimized using the Adam optimizer algorithm and a batch size of 10 for 100 epochs. However, it does not mention any cloud-based platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
