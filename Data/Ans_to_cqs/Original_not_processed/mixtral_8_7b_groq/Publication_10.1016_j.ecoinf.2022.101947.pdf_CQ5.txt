Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about a specific deep learning pipeline using datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses a study on Amur tigers and leopards in China using trail data and image classification.

The trail data comes from free-ranging Amur tigers of unknown identity at study sites. Trails were formed from footprints, and sub-trails were derived when there were more than 10 footprints in a single trail. The sex classification for images and subsequent designations for each trail were made using a method explained in Section 3.5.

The study also discusses data validation for determining the optimal size for algorithm training and test sets. The test set size was found to be optimal when it was smallest relative to the training set. However, the context does not provide information about the specific datasets used in this process.

In terms of equipment, a basic digital camera or smartphone with a minimum resolution of 1600 Ã— 1200 pixels, a metric scale, and a standard home-office laptop computer are mentioned. These are general hardware requirements and do not pertain to specific datasets.

In summary, the provided context discusses a study on Amur tigers and leopards using trail data and image classification but does not mention any specific deep learning pipeline or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
