Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the accuracy limits encountered while training DNN models with the detailed-labelled NIPS4Bplus dataset, and the comparison of the results with the BirdNET and SincNet models. The context also explains the models used for generating embeddings, including VGGish and BirdNET, as well as the datasets used for training. However, it does not mention the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
