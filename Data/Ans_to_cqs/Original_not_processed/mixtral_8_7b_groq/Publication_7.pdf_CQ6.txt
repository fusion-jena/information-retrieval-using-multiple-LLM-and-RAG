Answer:::

The provided text discusses a specific application of deep learning to image classification, particularly for identifying corals in marine images. However, it does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I cannot directly answer the query using the given context.

However, based on general practices in deep learning, we can infer that some preprocessing might have been carried out. For instance, the input images would likely need to be resized or reshaped to fit the input requirements of the VGGnet model. Additionally, the pixel values might have been normalized to a range between 0 and 1, which is a common practice in image processing.

In the context of the Benthoz15 dataset, the images are expert-annotated and geo-referenced, suggesting that the images were manually cleaned and labeled before use. 

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps, it is reasonable to infer that some preprocessing, such as resizing and normalization, was likely performed. Additionally, manual cleaning and labeling were done as part of the dataset preparation.
