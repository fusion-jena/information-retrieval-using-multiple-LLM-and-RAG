Answer:::

In the deep learning pipeline, regularization methods are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data that may not generalize well to new, unseen data.

In the context provided, L1 and L2 regularization are mentioned as the regularization methods used for the LightGBM models. L1 regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of the coefficients, while L2 regularization adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients. These regularization methods work by shrinking the coefficients towards zero, which can help to reduce the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting.

However, the deep learning pipeline in this context uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, which typically uses different regularization methods such as dropout and weight decay (which is equivalent to L2 regularization). Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by promoting the model to learn more robust features. Weight decay, on the other hand, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the weights, which encourages the model to learn smaller weights and prevent overfitting.

It's important to note that the specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline will depend on the implementation and the specific problem at hand. In this context, L1 and L2 regularization were used for the LightGBM models, while dropout and weight decay could have been used for the ANN model. However, the text does not provide enough information to confirm the specific regularization methods used for the ANN model.
