Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, I can provide some insights on how randomness can be handled in machine learning pipelines in general, which may also apply to deep learning.

In machine learning, randomness can be introduced during various stages, such as data splitting, feature selection, and weight initialization. Strategies to handle randomness include:

1. **Fixed random seed:** By setting a fixed random seed value, you ensure that the same sequence of random numbers is generated every time the model is trained. This helps in reproducing the same results and enables better comparison of experiments.

2. **Cross-validation:** Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a model by dividing the dataset into multiple folds. By using a fixed seed value, you can ensure that the data is split consistently across different iterations, making the evaluation more reliable.

3. **Ensemble methods:** Ensemble methods, like the one implemented in "biomod2" (Thuiller et al., 2009; 2014), combine multiple models to improve the overall performance. These methods can help reduce the impact of randomness by averaging the results of several models, each with its unique initialization.

4. **Initialization strategies:** In deep learning, weight initialization can be a source of randomness. Techniques like Xavier initialization (Glorot & Bengio, 2010) or He initialization (He et al., 2015) can help ensure that the initial weights are set in a way that enables efficient learning and reduces the impact of randomness.

Although the context does not explicitly mention deep learning, the "sdm," "dismo," "bioclim," and "biomod2" packages are used for machine learning and statistical analysis in the context provided. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that similar strategies for handling randomness would be applied in deep learning pipelines as well.

Answer:::
Strategies to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines include setting a fixed random seed value, using cross-validation, employing ensemble methods, and utilizing initialization strategies like Xavier or He initialization. These methods help ensure reproducibility, reliable evaluation, and efficient learning in deep learning models.
