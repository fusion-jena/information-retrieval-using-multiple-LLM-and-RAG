Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the configuration of a model for multi-temporal forecasting of daily streamflow (Qflow) using a combination of deep learning and machine learning models.

The deep learning models mentioned in the context are CNN-BiGRU, CNN-BiRNN, and their variants. These models are primarily used for time series forecasting and natural language processing tasks, which typically do not require data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, these models work with sequential data, where the order of the data points is important.

In summary, based on the provided context, data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation are not explicitly mentioned or relevant to the deep learning pipeline discussed in the context.
