Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipelines. However, it does mention the use of CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) for plant leaf disease classification and pine tree classification. Commonly, datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet are used for training and testing CNNs.

For instance, the Krizhevsky et al. (2012) paper mentioned in the context uses the ImageNet dataset for image classification with deep convolutional neural networks. The ImageNet dataset contains over 14 million images belonging to 1000 classes, making it a popular choice for training and evaluating CNNs.

Furthermore, the CVIP100 dataset is mentioned in the context, which is a dataset for plant leaf disease classification. This dataset contains images of plant leaves with different diseases, and it is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed deep learning approach for plant leaf disease classification.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the use of MNIST or CIFAR datasets, it does mention the use of the ImageNet dataset and a specific dataset for plant leaf disease classification, the CVIP100 dataset.
