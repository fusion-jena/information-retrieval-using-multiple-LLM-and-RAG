Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the model architecture, specifically the encoder and decoder setup as wide residual networks, and the pre-processing block of the encoder. Therefore, I cannot provide the code repository link based on the given information. I recommend checking the original research paper or the authors' affiliated websites for more details.
