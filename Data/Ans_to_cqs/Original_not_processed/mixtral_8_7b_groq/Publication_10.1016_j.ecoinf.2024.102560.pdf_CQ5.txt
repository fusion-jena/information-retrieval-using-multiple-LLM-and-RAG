The provided context does not discuss a deep learning pipeline using datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it focuses on the use of satellite-based datasets for drought monitoring and land cover variation assessment in the Urmia Lake basin.

The datasets mentioned in the context are:

1. CMAP (Climate Prediction Center's Merged Analysis of Precipitation): A collection of precipitation datasets produced by analyzing gauge data and estimating satellite-based precipitation. The spatial resolution of CMAP is 2.5 x 2.5 degrees, and its temporal resolution is monthly.
2. Landsat satellite datasets: Used to investigate water surface area and salinity variations over a long period of time (1985 to 2020). These datasets were used to select images with cloud cover less than 10% for land cover variation analysis.
3. MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) datasets: Two specific products, MOD13Q1 (16-day composite MODIS vegetation product at 250-m spatial resolution) and MOD11A2 (eight-day composite MODIS Land Surface Temperature product at 1-km spatial resolution), were used for drought monitoring. These datasets were extracted from the Google Earth Engine platform.

These satellite-based datasets were used for various purposes, such as calculating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), day-time land surface temperature, and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) time series. The datasets were also used to assess drought variations and map the basin in terms of drought and mean entropy.

In summary, the provided context discusses the use of satellite-based datasets, such as CMAP, Landsat, and MODIS, for drought monitoring and land cover variation analysis in the Urmia Lake basin. It does not mention any deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
