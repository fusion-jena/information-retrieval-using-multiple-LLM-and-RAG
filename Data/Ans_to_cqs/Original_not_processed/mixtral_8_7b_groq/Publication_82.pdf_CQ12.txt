Answer:::

The deep learning models used in the pipeline mentioned in the context are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This is inferred from the choice of architectures used, which include AlexNet and GoogLeNet. Both of these architectures are well-known CNNs that have been extensively used in image recognition tasks. AlexNet was the winner of the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2012, and GoogLeNet (also known as Inception) won the same competition in 2014. These architectures consist of multiple convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction, followed by fully connected layers for classification. The context also mentions the use of ReLu activation units and dropout layers, which are commonly used in CNNs. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning models used in this pipeline are CNNs.
