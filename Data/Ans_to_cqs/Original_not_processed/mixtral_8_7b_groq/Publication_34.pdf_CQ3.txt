Based on the information provided, the text does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the CNN model. However, it does provide information about the architecture of the CNN model used for plant species observations.

The CNN model is composed of two hidden convolutional layers and one fully connected layer. The first layer has 64 convolution filters of kernel size (3, 3) with 1 line of 0 padding. The feature maps are batch-normalized, transformed with a Relu, and average pooling with a (8, 8) kernel and stride is applied. The second layer has 128 convolution filters of kernel size (5, 5) with 2 lines of padding, batch-normalization, and Relu are applied, followed by another average pooling. The resulting feature maps are flattened and fed into a fully connected layer.

Additionally, the text mentions that the CNN model is used for plant species observations, which have been collected and geolocated with a high level of precision. These observations have been collected through citizen programs in biodiversity sciences and are expected to reach similar volumes of observations to the sum of national museums, herbaria, and conservatories in the next few years.

In summary, while the text does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the CNN model, it does give details about the architecture of the CNN model and the type of data it is used for, which are plant species observations.
