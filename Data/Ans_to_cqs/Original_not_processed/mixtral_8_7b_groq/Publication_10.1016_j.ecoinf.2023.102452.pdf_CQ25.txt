Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model in the study by Dehghani et al., 2023 is short-term streamflow forecasting. The deep learning models used in this study are Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and ConvLSTM. These models are used to predict the hourly streamflow, which is an important task in water resources management and flood forecasting.

The use of deep learning models for streamflow forecasting is not uncommon. For instance, Feng et al., 2017 used a data-driven multi-model methodology with deep feature selection for short-term wind forecasting. Similarly, Wang and Ding, 2003 developed a wavelet network model for the prediction of hydrology. However, the study by Dehghani et al., 2023 is unique in its comparative evaluation of different deep learning models for streamflow forecasting.

The selection of deep learning models for streamflow forecasting is based on their ability to learn complex patterns and dependencies in the data. LSTM, for example, is a type of recurrent neural network that is capable of learning long-term dependencies in the data. This makes it suitable for time series forecasting tasks such as streamflow forecasting. CNN, on the other hand, is a type of neural network that is commonly used for image analysis tasks. However, it has also been used for time series forecasting tasks by treating the time series data as an image. ConvLSTM is a combination of CNN and LSTM, which combines the strengths of both models.

The performance of these deep learning models is compared with other machine learning models such as Gaussian regression, support vector machine, and M5 trees by Uncuoglu et al., 2022. They found that the deep learning models outperformed the traditional machine learning models in solving civil engineering problems.

In summary, the purpose of the deep learning model in the study by Dehghani et al., 2023 is short-term streamflow forecasting. The deep learning models used in this study are LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM, which are chosen for their ability to learn complex patterns and dependencies in the data. The performance of these deep learning models is compared with other machine learning models, and it is found that the deep learning models outperformed the traditional machine learning models.
