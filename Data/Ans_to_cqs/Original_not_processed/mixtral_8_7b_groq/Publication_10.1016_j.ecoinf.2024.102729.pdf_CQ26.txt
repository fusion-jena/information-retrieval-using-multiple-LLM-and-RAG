Answer:::

The provided texts discuss various applications of deep learning and machine learning in water quality management, environmental pollution, and data analysis. However, they do not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, we cannot directly answer the query using the given context.

However, based on general knowledge of data preprocessing in machine learning and deep learning, some common techniques to address data bias include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the data into subgroups based on specific criteria (strata) and then randomly sampling from each subgroup. Stratified splitting ensures that the training, validation, and test sets have a similar distribution of samples concerning the chosen criteria.

2. Oversampling: In oversampling, the minority class in an imbalanced dataset is increased by replicating samples. This technique helps balance the dataset and prevents the model from being biased towards the majority class.

3. Undersampling: Undersampling is the opposite of oversampling, where the majority class is reduced by removing samples. This method also helps balance the dataset but may result in loss of valuable information.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting diverse and representative data is crucial for reducing bias. This involves gathering data from various sources, locations, and conditions to ensure that the dataset is well-rounded and captures the inherent variability of the problem.

While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, they are widely used in the field of deep learning and machine learning for addressing data bias during preprocessing.
