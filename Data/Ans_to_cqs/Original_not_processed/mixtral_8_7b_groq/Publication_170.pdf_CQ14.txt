Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text does not mention any methods such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization techniques.

The context does provide information about the training process, which includes two modes: zero-start and incremental training. In the zero-start training mode, the model is initialized with randomly generated parameters and then trained on a training set. In contrast, the incremental training mode retrains the model by starting from the previously trained model and using an expanded training set. However, this information pertains to the training process and not to the optimization of hyperparameters.

Moreover, the context describes the evaluation of the model's performance, which includes errors and time costs evaluation. The evaluation uses three metrics: overall error, commission error, and omission error. Again, this information relates to the evaluation of the model's performance and not to the optimization of hyperparameters.

Therefore, based on the provided context, there is no information available on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
