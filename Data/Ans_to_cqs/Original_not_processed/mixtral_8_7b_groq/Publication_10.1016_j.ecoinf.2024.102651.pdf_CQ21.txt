Based on the information provided, there are no specific postprocessing steps mentioned after the model training. However, we can infer some possible steps that might have been involved based on the context.

Firstly, the context mentions the use of Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to improve the classification accuracy of the model. CAM is a technique used to visualize the important regions attended by the model for a particular classification decision. Therefore, generating CAM images can be considered as a postprocessing step. CAM images can help in understanding how the model is making its decisions and can be useful for debugging and improving the model.

Secondly, the context mentions the calculation of metrics such as accuracy. Therefore, calculating metrics to evaluate the performance of the model can be considered as another postprocessing step. Metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix can provide insights into the model's performance and help in identifying any biases or errors in the classification.

Lastly, the context mentions the use of a residual network and a hybrid network (CA-Hybrid) for classification. Therefore, comparing the performance of these models and selecting the best one can be considered as another postprocessing step. This step can help in identifying the most suitable model for the given task and can provide insights into the trade-offs between different models.

In summary, based on the provided context, the possible postprocessing steps after model training can include generating CAM images, calculating metrics, and comparing the performance of different models. However, the context does not explicitly mention these steps, and therefore, this answer is based on inferences drawn from the given information.
