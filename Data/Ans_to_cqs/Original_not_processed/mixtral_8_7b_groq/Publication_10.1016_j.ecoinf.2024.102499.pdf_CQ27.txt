Answer:::

The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved several steps, including model serialization and platform selection. First, the model was trained using a specific architecture (NASnet) with a Faster-rcnn backbone, implemented in Tensorflow2. The model was trained on a dataset of images resized to 1333 Ã— 800 pixels, with a learning rate of 0.008 and a cosine learning rate decay. The training was done for 200,000 iterations with a batch size of 16 images per iteration, using a GPU-cluster equipped with 4 RTX8000.

To evaluate the performance of the model, recall, precision, and F-measure were computed for each model. During the training phase, both shark species and non-shark species were included to enhance the ability of the CNN to build pertinent feature embeddings. Specifically, 19 non-shark species that were commonly associated with or exhibited resemblances to the studied shark species were included.

Once the training was completed, the model was serialized, which involved saving the model's architecture, weights, and other relevant information into a file. This file could then be used to recreate the model at a later time without having to retrain it.

For deployment, a platform was selected based on the specific requirements of the use case. In this case, the model was deployed on a system that could process video data in real-time to detect the presence of sharks. The serialized model was loaded onto this system, and the video data was passed through the model to detect sharks.

Overall, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved training the model using a specific architecture and dataset, evaluating its performance, serializing the model, and deploying it on a suitable platform for real-time video processing.
