Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the model serialization or platform selection process that was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer some parts of the process based on the information available.

The model selection and parameter optimization process involved splitting the labeled dataset into training and testing datasets, with 50% of the training data held-out for validation. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a cubic polynomial kernel was then trained using the ResNet-50 fc1000 activations of the full training dataset. A 10-fold cross-validation was used to define the score-to-posterior-probability transformation function, which provides a basis for estimating the posterior probability for new observations.

After training the model, the final classification model was used to classify candidate detections based on the layer activations. The activations were extracted automatically using the activations from ResNet-50's deep, fully connected layer fc1000, located just before its classification layer. A one vs. all support vector machine (SVM) classifier was then used to identify the optimal decision boundary to differentiate 'boatwhistles' from 'other' signals within the feature space.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention model serialization or platform selection, it can be inferred that the trained model was used in a classification workflow to categorize candidate detections. However, further information would be needed to provide a complete answer to the query.
