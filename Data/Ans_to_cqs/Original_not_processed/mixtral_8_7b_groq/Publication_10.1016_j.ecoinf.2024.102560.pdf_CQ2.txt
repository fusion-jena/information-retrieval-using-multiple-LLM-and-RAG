Based on the provided context, the following data formats are used in the study:

1. Raster images: Landsat satellite datasets and MODIS datasets are used in the form of raster images. These datasets are used to investigate water surface area and salinity variations, as well as for drought monitoring. The Landsat datasets have a spatial resolution of 30 meters, and it takes eight “Landsat frames” to cover the entire Urmia Lake basin. The MODIS datasets include vegetation indices, surface reflectance bands, and day-time land surface temperature, with spatial resolutions of 250 meters and 1 kilometer. A total of 150 images from 1985 to 2020 and 250 images with cloud cover percentage less than 10% are used in the study.

2. Vector data: The CMAP (Climate Prediction Center's Merged Analysis of Precipitation) dataset is used in the form of vector data. This dataset is a collection of precipitation datasets that can be produced by analyzing gauge data and estimating satellite-based precipitation. The spatial resolution of the CMAP is 2.5 degrees, and the data is available in monthly temporal resolution.

3. Tabular data: Quality assurance (QA) layers associated with MOD11A2 and MOD13Q1 images are used in the form of tabular data. These QA layers are used to evaluate the quality reliability of MOD13Q1 and MOD11A2 products.

Therefore, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline include raster images, vector data, and tabular data.
