Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific deep learning framework used in the study by Zhang, L., Shao, Z., Liu, J., and Cheng, Q. (2019) for building their deep learning model. The context only mentions that the study uses a "deep learning based retrieval of forest" but does not specify the deep learning framework.

However, it is important to note that the study was published in 2019, and at that time, TensorFlow and PyTorch were already popular deep learning frameworks. Therefore, it is possible that one of these two frameworks was used in the study.

TensorFlow is an open-source platform for machine learning and artificial intelligence developed by Google Brain Team. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.

PyTorch, on the other hand, is an open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. It is primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab.

Without further information, it is impossible to determine which deep learning framework was used in the study. However, it is safe to assume that either TensorFlow or PyTorch was used, given their popularity and widespread use in the machine learning and deep learning communities.
