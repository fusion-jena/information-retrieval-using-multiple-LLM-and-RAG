Based on the provided context, there is no information about the deployment of a deep learning model. Instead, there is information about the development and validation of a three-layer backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) model using MATLAB R2014b. Here's the process that was followed for the BP-ANN model:

1. Data collection: The study used water samples from inland rivers in various trophic states. The spectral characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) were measured using aCDOM(254) and Fn(355). Trophic State Index (TSI) was used as the predictor variable.

2. Model development: A three-layer BP-ANN model was built with the first layer (input layer) corresponding to aCDOM(254) and Fn(355). The intermediate layer (hidden layers) and the last layer (output layer) comprised a single neuron that corresponded to the predictor (TSI).

3. Model training: The maximum training times were set to 10,000, and the training error was set to 0.001. 64 water samples were utilized for model calibration.

4. Model validation: The remaining water samples were used for validation. Validation accuracy was assessed by calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI.

5. Model serialization: There is no information provided about model serialization or platform selection for deployment.

Therefore, based on the given context, the answer to the query is:

Answer:::
There is no information provided about the deployment of the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. The context mainly focuses on the development and validation of a three-layer backpropagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) model using MATLAB R2014b.
