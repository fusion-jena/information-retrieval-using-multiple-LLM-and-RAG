Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the purpose of a deep learning model, such as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, the context does provide information about species distribution modeling (SDM) and the use of machine learning methods in this field.

In SDM, machine learning methods such as Maxent, Random Forests, Boosted Regression Trees, and Generalized Additive Models (GAM) are used to evaluate the effectiveness of models in correcting sampling bias. Among these, Maxent has become widely used due to its superior predictive ability, particularly given the difficulty of obtaining reliable absence information.

The purpose of SDM is to predict the potential distribution of species based on environmental variables. This involves mapping the environmental space to the geographic space and correcting sampling bias caused by the environment. The effectiveness of SDM models is evaluated using two indicators: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and delta D (Î”D).

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly answer the query about the purpose of a deep learning model, it does provide insight into the use of machine learning methods in SDM for environmental covariates. The purpose of these machine learning methods, including deep learning models, in SDM would be to improve the accuracy and predictive ability of species distribution models by correcting sampling bias and incorporating complex environmental variables.
