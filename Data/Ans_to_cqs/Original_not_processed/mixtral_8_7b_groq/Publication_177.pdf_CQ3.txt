The provided context does not include specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of various deep learning models for plant identification tasks.

In the context, Ghazi et al. used ensembling of GoogleNet and VGG networks to obtain an accuracy of 80.18% on a validation dataset of the LifeCLEF 2015 dataset. Šulc and Matas used a bagging ensemble of three ResNet152-layered CNN networks to obtain a performance of 78.8% mean average precision (MAP) on a Plant CLEF 2016 dataset. Wu et al. used deep learning with taxonomic loss for plant identification. Haupt et al. used large-scale plant classification using deep convolutional neural networks. Lasseck used image-based plant species identification with deep Convolutional Neural Networks. Mehdipour Ghazi et al. used plant identification using deep neural networks via optimization of transfer learning parameters. Šulc and Matas used fine-grained recognition of plants from images.

While these studies use deep learning models for plant identification, they do not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used. However, based on the nature of the task, it can be inferred that annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or pixel-level annotation may have been used to prepare the datasets for these studies.

Bounding box annotation involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image, while instance segmentation involves labeling each pixel of the object of interest. Pixel-level annotation is a more detailed form of annotation where each pixel is labeled with its corresponding class.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used, it can be inferred that one or more of these techniques may have been used in the deep learning pipeline for plant identification tasks.
