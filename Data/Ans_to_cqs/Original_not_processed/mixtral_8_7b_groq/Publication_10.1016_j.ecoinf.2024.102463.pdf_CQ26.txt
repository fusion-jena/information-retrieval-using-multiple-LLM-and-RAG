Answer:::

The provided context discusses hyperparameter optimization techniques for deep learning model architectures, specifically Hyperband, but it does not directly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. However, I can provide some relevant information on data bias mitigation techniques that are commonly used in the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline.

Data bias is a common issue that can negatively impact the performance of machine learning models, including deep learning models. Bias in the data can arise from various sources, such as unrepresentative samples, measurement errors, or systemic discrimination. To address data bias during preprocessing, several techniques can be employed:

1. **Stratified sampling**: Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures each subset (or stratum) of the population is proportionally represented in the sample. This technique can be used during the splitting of data into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure that each set has a similar distribution of classes or labels.
2. **Oversampling**: Oversampling is a technique used to increase the representation of the minority class in an imbalanced dataset. This can be done by replicating instances from the minority class or by generating synthetic instances using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. **Undersampling**: Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the representation of the majority class in an imbalanced dataset. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of instances from the majority class. However, this technique may result in loss of information.
4. **Diverse data collection**: Collecting diverse data is crucial to reducing data bias. This involves gathering data from various sources, demographics, and conditions to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, it is essential to consider data bias mitigation strategies during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline to ensure the model's performance and fairness.
