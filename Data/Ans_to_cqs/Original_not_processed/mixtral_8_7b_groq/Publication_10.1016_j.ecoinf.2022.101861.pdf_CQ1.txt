Answer:::

The methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines for bird and frog species identification can include surveys, sensors, and potentially public datasets. However, the specific context provided does not mention the use of public datasets.

In the context "A low-cost, yet simple and highly repeatable system for acoustically surveying cryptic species" by Lambert and McDonald (2014), a low-cost system for acoustic surveying is described. This system can be used for collecting raw data in the form of sound recordings of cryptic species.

In the context "A pipeline for identification of bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings using a convolutional neural network" by LeBien et al. (2020), the authors describe a pipeline that uses soundscape recordings as raw data. Soundscape recordings are typically collected using specialized recording devices, such as microphones or audio recorders, placed in the environment.

The context "Using community science data to help identify threatened species occurrences outside of known ranges" by Lin et al. (2022) describes the use of community science data for identifying threatened species occurrences. Community science data refers to data collected by volunteers, often through surveys or observations. In this case, the community science data is in the form of sound recordings of bird species.

In the context "The machine learningâ€“powered BirdNET app reduces barriers to global bird research by enabling citizen science participation" by Wood et al. (2022), the authors describe the use of the BirdNET app for collecting sound recordings of bird species. The BirdNET app is a tool that enables citizen science participation in global bird research.

Overall, the methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines for bird and frog species identification can include surveys, sensors, and potentially public datasets. However, the specific context provided mainly mentions the use of sound recordings collected through surveys or specialized recording devices.
