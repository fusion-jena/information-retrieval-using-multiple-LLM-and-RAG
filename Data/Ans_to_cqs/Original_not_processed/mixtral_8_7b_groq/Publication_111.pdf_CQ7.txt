Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it is mentioned that in the proposed model, the training data is separated into training and validation groups to track the generalization performance and apply the early stopping strategy. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data splitting approach in the provided context involves dividing the data into training and validation sets, which is a common practice in deep learning.

In deep learning, data splitting is an essential step to evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting. The data is typically divided into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

In the context of the proposed system, the training data is used to train the deep learning model, and the validation set is used to monitor the generalization performance during training. The early stopping strategy is applied to halt the training when the generalization performance starts to degrade for a number of epochs. This approach helps to prevent overfitting and improve the model's performance.

Moreover, the context mentions the use of the dropout approach to deal with overfitting in the proposed system. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out a certain proportion of layer neurons during training, allowing the model to train with alternative topologies in parallel. This approach helps to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance.

In summary, while the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not provided in the context, it can be inferred that the data splitting approach involves dividing the data into training and validation sets. The early stopping strategy and dropout approach are used to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance.
