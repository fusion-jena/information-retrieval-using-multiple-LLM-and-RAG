Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context includes several research papers that have used deep learning models, particularly the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, for various applications such as urban expansion trend analysis, flooding impact assessment, and forest type categorization. However, none of these papers mention or provide a link to the data repository of their deep learning pipeline.

The context includes a figure (Fig. 6) and a table (Table 9) from the paper "Spatial distribution of forest types in the study site using XGBoost" by V.T. Pham et al. (2024), which shows the spatial distribution and percentage of different forest types in the study site using XGBoost. Additionally, Table 8 provides the accuracy of forest types using XGBoost. However, there is no information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in this study.

Therefore, I am unable to provide the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study.
