Answer:::
The context provided does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework was used to build the model. Two of the most popular frameworks for building deep learning models are TensorFlow and PyTorch. TensorFlow is a powerful library developed by Google Brain Team, while PyTorch is a popular open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. These libraries provide tools and functions that simplify the process of designing, training, and deploying deep learning models. However, without specific information in the context, it is not possible to determine which of these or any other framework was used to build the deep learning model for LULC (Land Use and Land Cover) classification.
