Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline of the ibis.iSDM package. However, it can be inferred that the package primarily works with biodiversity data, which is likely to be in the form of occurrence records or presence-absence data. These data might be provided in various formats, such as CSV or other tabular formats, but the context does not give specific details about this.

Moreover, the package supports the integration of multiple biodiversity data sources and covariate data, which could include various types of data such as climatic data, habitat data, or other environmental data. These data might also be provided in different formats.

The context also mentions the use of machine learning approaches, which could include deep learning methods. However, it does not provide information on how these methods are implemented or what type of data they require.

Therefore, while it can be inferred that the ibis.iSDM package works with biodiversity data and various covariate data, the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
