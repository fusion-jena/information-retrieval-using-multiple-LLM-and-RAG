Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. However, it does mention some hyperparameters that were used during training, like learning rate, momentum, weight decay, and gamma. It is possible that an optimization technique was used but not explicitly mentioned. In general, SGD and Adam are commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning. SGD is a simple optimization algorithm used to update the parameters of the model, while Adam is an extension of SGD that includes an adaptive learning rate, making it more efficient in some cases. Without further information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
