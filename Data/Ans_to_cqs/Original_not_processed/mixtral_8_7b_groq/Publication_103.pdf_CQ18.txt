Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit strategy mentioned for monitoring the model performance during training. However, it is mentioned that the neural network is trained on a training set and then tested on a test set, which implies that the performance of the model is evaluated after training it on the entire training set.

In the context, the performance of the model is evaluated using top-1 accuracy and top-5 accuracy metrics. Top-1 accuracy measures the percentage of images for which the model correctly predicts the class with the highest probability, while top-5 accuracy measures the percentage of images for which the model includes the correct class in its top five predictions.

Furthermore, the context describes a methodology for transferring knowledge from one dataset to another, which involves training the network on a source dataset, replacing the linear classification layer with a new one aimed at classifying the classes in the target dataset, and then fine-tuning the network on the target dataset. This methodology suggests that the performance of the model is evaluated after fine-tuning it on the target dataset.

Therefore, while there is no explicit strategy mentioned for monitoring the model performance during training, it is clear that the performance of the model is evaluated after training it on the entire training set and fine-tuning it on the target dataset.
