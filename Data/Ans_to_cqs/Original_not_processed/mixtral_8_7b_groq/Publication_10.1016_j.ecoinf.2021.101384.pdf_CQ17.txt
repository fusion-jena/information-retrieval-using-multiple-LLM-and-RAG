The provided context does not include information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses workflows, data classification, spatio-temporal aggregation, and FAIR data principles in the context of big data processing for studying fishing activity and threatened species. However, it does not mention any specific regularization techniques such as dropout, L2 regularization, or others. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
