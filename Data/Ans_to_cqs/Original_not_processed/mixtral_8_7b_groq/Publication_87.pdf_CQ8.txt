Answer:::
The code repository for the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the authors have included a reproducible example in the Appendix of their paper. This reproducible example includes data preparation, model training, and automatic labeling of new images. It is possible that the code repository may be available in the Appendix or as a supplementary material of the paper. I would recommend looking for it in the aforementioned sources or contacting the authors for more information.
