Answer:::
The deep learning model was built using the TensorFlow framework. The model was trained in R, using the keras package, which is an interface to TensorFlow for R. This allowed the researchers to use the ResNet50 architecture and an adam optimizer to train the model from scratch for 55 epochs. By using TensorFlow and the keras package, the researchers were able to leverage the power and flexibility of these tools to create a deep learning model for image classification.
