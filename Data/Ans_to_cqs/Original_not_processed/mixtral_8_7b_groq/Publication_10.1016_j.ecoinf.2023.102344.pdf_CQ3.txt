The provided context does not give specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the deep learning models used in the study were pre-trained on image-based datasets. Common data annotation techniques used in image-based deep learning include:

1. Image classification: This is the most basic form of image annotation where an image is assigned to a particular class or category.
2. Object detection: In this technique, a bounding box is drawn around the object of interest in an image. This helps the model to identify and locate the object within the image.
3. Semantic segmentation: This is a more advanced form of image annotation where each pixel in an image is assigned to a particular class or category. This helps the model to understand the spatial layout of objects within an image.
4. Instance segmentation: This is a further refinement of semantic segmentation where each instance of an object is assigned a unique label. This helps the model to differentiate between multiple instances of the same object within an image.

Based on the context, it can be inferred that the pre-trained models used in the study were trained on image-based datasets with some form of data annotation. However, the specific annotation techniques used are not mentioned.
