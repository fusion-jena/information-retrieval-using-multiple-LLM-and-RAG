Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context mainly focuses on the introduction and application of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm in ecological informatics.

However, it is worth noting that in the context of model training and evaluation, the authors have mentioned the calculation of Euclidean distance as a part of the DTW algorithm. Specifically, the equation for calculating Euclidean distance (d(ij)) is provided, which is used as a measure of dissimilarity between two points in the time series.

Additionally, the concept of an accumulative cost matrix (D) is introduced, which is used to store the cumulative cost of warping from the beginning to the current cell in the matrix. The warping path, which is the path of lowest total cost, is determined by searching through the accumulative distance matrix from the location (1,1) to (n, m).

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix, it does provide information on how the DTW algorithm calculates the dissimilarity between two time series using Euclidean distance and an accumulative cost matrix.
