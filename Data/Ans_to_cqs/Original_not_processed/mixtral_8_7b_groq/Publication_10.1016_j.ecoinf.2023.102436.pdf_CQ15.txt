Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam used in a deep learning pipeline for landscape photography, environmental performance evaluation, or restorative map construction.

However, Puschmann (2019) applied a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the automatic recognition of woody regrowth vegetation in repeat landscape photographs. CNNs are a type of deep learning model that can be optimized using techniques like SGD, Adam, or others. Therefore, it is plausible that optimization techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline but are not explicitly mentioned in the context provided.

In the study by Cheshmehzangi (2016), a procedural approach with computational simulations was used for multi-spatial environmental performance evaluation in integrated urban design. While this study does not involve deep learning, optimization techniques are commonly used in computational simulations and optimization problems.

In the study by Guo et al. (2023), 3D landscape indexes were constructed based on oblique photogrammetry and applied for islands. Although the study uses 3D models, it does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning or optimization techniques.

In summary, while optimization techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of SGD, Adam, or other optimization techniques in the deep learning pipelines used for landscape photography, environmental performance evaluation, or restorative map construction.
