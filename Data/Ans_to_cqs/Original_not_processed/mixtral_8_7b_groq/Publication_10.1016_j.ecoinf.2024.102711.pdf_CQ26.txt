The provided context discusses various techniques used to improve the performance of machine learning models, including addressing data bias and tuning hyperparameters. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific preprocessing techniques for addressing data bias in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I will provide a general answer based on common practices in the field.

Answer:::
In deep learning pipelines, data bias can be addressed during preprocessing using several techniques, including stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

1. Stratified splitting: When splitting a dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, it is crucial to maintain the same class distribution in each subset. Stratified sampling ensures that each subset has a proportion of samples that reflects the original dataset's class distribution. This helps prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

2. Oversampling: In imbalanced datasets, the minority class is often underrepresented. Oversampling involves creating synthetic samples from the minority class to balance the dataset. This can be done using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). However, oversampling should be used carefully, as it may lead to overfitting if not combined with other techniques.

3. Undersampling: Alternatively, undersampling involves reducing the majority class to balance the dataset. This technique is useful when the minority class is well-represented, and the majority class has many redundant samples. However, it may lead to loss of valuable information.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting diverse data from various sources can help reduce bias in the dataset. This includes collecting data from different geographical locations, demographic groups, and time periods. A diverse dataset ensures that the model is exposed to a wide range of variations, reducing the likelihood of bias.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, it does discuss the importance of addressing data bias and imbalance in machine learning models. The use of AutoML and generative adversarial networks (GANs) can also help address data bias during preprocessing. AutoML can automate the process of selecting and applying preprocessing techniques, while GANs can generate synthetic data to balance the dataset. However, the effectiveness of these techniques depends on the specific dataset and problem at hand.
