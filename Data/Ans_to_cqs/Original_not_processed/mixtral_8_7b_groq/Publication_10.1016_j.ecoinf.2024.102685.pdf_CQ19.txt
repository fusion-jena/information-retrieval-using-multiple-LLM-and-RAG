Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about the use of deep learning models in the study. The study primarily focuses on the application of a Random Forest (RF) machine learning method for mapping seagrass habitats using multispectral images.

The study mentions the use of RF as a machine learning method, which is a type of ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to improve the overall performance. However, deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch are not mentioned in the context.

Therefore, it is not possible to answer the query about the specific deep learning frameworks used in this study as they are not mentioned in the provided context.
