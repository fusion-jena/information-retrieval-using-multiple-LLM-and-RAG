The primary methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline involve the use of sensors to gather information from the environment. These sensors include audio recorders for capturing bird vocalizations and cameras for tracking populations of invasive snakes. The audio recorders typically capture 16-bit stereo audio at a sample rate of 22,000 samples per second, while the cameras ingest 2048-by-1536 8-bit 4:2:2 color images. These sensors are often deployed in remote locations and collect data continuously, generating large volumes of high-bit-rate data.

In addition to sensors, the raw data may also come from other sources such as public datasets. However, the provided context suggests that the primary focus is on collecting original data using sensors, rather than relying on pre-existing datasets.

Once the raw data is collected, it is transmitted back to a central data store where it can be analyzed using a variety of algorithms. The sheer volume of data generated by these sensors can be a challenge, requiring a robust big data infrastructure and significant labor to process and analyze.

To address this challenge, the approach leverages advances in the areas of big data and deep learning. The focus is on processing and analyzing large, high-bit-rate datasets such as audio and image streams. Other environmental sensor data, like temperature or air quality, utilize much lower data rates.

The use of sensors to collect raw data has several advantages over traditional survey methods. It helps to alleviate problems associated with traditional surveys, such as sampling, variability, and bias. Additionally, the costs are reduced as the expense of transporting and sustaining field crews in remote locations is instead applied to less frequently serviced sensor hardware.

In summary, the primary methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline involve the use of sensors to gather information from the environment. These sensors include audio recorders and cameras, which collect large volumes of high-bit-rate data. The data is then transmitted back to a central data store where it can be analyzed using a variety of algorithms, leveraging advances in the areas of big data and deep learning to handle and analyze the sheer volume of data generated by these sensors.
