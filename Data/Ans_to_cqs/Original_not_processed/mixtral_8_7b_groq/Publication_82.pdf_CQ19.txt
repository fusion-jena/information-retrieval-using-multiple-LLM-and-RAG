Answer:::
 The deep learning models in the study were built using Cafe, a fast, open-source framework for deep learning. The authors used their own fork of Cafe for the experiments. The basic results can also be replicated using a standard instance of Cafe.

The study does not mention the use of other popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras. It is important to note that the choice of deep learning framework often depends on the specific requirements of the project, the expertise of the team, and the available resources. Therefore, while this study used Cafe, other studies or applications may use different frameworks.
