The provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention some hyperparameters that were studied for their impact on calibration: depth, batch normalization, weight decay, and the scaling of logits passed to the softmax function.

The hyperparameter "depth" refers to the number of layers in the neural network. The models used in the study include ResNet18 and ResNet50, which have 18 and 50 layers, respectively. The impact of depth on calibration is not specified in the context.

Batch normalization is a technique used to normalize the inputs of each layer in a neural network. It can help improve the training of deep neural networks by reducing internal covariate shift. The context does not provide information on how batch normalization affects calibration.

Weight decay, also known as L2 regularization, is a technique used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. It adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. The context does not provide information on how weight decay affects calibration.

Scaling the logits passed to the softmax function can help calibrate the network. Logits are the raw, unnormalized output values from the last layer of a neural network. Scaling these values can adjust the relative confidence of the network's predictions. The context does not provide information on how the logits were scaled or what impact this had on calibration.

In summary, while the context provides information on some hyperparameters that were studied for their impact on calibration, it does not give specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. Additionally, the impact of depth, batch normalization, weight decay, and logit scaling on calibration is not specified in the context.
