Based on the provided context, the data format used in the study is not specifically mentioned as being related to deep learning or any particular type of data format such as image, audio, video, or CSV. However, it does mention the use of a survey dataset from 2017 and the calculation of various forestry-related metrics.

The study uses the inventory estimator, which is a method for estimating the total value of a variable based on a sample of observations. In this case, the variable of interest is tree cover, and the observations are measurements taken at specific sample points in a forested area.

The study also describes several methods for quantifying tree diversity and spatial arrangement, including the Clark and Evans aggregation index, species mingling, weighted species mingling, species size differentiation, and species size dominance. These methods involve calculating various metrics based on the species and size of trees within a specified radius or number of nearest neighbors.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the data format used in this study is likely a structured dataset containing information about the location, species, and size of trees in the surveyed area. This could be in a format such as CSV or a similar tabular format, but it is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

In summary, while the specific data format used in the study is not mentioned, it is likely a structured dataset containing information about tree location, species, and size.
