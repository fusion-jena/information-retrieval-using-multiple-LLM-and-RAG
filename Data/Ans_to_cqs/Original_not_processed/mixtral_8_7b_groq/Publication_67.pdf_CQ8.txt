Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text only refers to various materials and archives that contain data, figures, and metadata used in the research. Therefore, I cannot provide the specific location of the code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) based on the given information. You may need to contact the authors or look for additional resources to find the code repository.
