Based on the provided context, there is no information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. The context mainly focuses on the use of Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and other machine learning models for estimating total nitrogen (TN) in soil samples. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query using the given information.
