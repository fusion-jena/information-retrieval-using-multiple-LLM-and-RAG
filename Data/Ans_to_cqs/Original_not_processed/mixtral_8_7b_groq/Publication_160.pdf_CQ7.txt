Answer:::

The provided context does not give explicit information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it can be inferred that the data was split into training, validation, and test sets, as the model's performance was evaluated on these three sets.

The validation set was used for training and optimizing the learning rates (LRs) using the grid search tool implemented in scikit-learn. The validation set was also used for assessing the coverages and bounds for the coverage and top-5 accuracy on the unclassified part of the dataset.

The trained models were then applied to the training and test sets with specific risk levels to assess the corresponding coverages.

Therefore, while the specific criteria for splitting the data are not provided, it can be inferred that the data was split into three sets, and the validation set was used for model training, optimization, and assessment.
