Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. The text mentions that vessel data is distributed by the Global Fishing Watch (GFW) at a spatial resolution of 0.01, and fishing activity cells are already classified through a machine learning model. However, it does not specify the type of machine learning or deep learning model used, nor does it provide details about the hyperparameters of the model.

The algorithm described in the text associates information on stocks, species variety, and threatening status to the fishing hours of each cell in the studied area. It does not mention any hyperparameters related to a deep learning model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
