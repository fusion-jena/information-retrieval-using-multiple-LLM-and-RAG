Answer:::
The deep learning model is built using the PyTorch framework. The VGG16 network, which serves as the foundation for the modeling approach, is sourced from the torch library, which is a part of PyTorch. This network is then duplicated to provide a basis for each modeling approach. For the CNN Ã¾ SVM modeling approach, the architecture up to the first FC layer (FC1) is kept, creating a feature extractor. This feature extractor is then paired with an SVM, sourced from the scikit-learn library. On the other hand, for the CNN approach, the full VGG16 network is used, leaving the feature extractor and classifier intact. This demonstrates that the PyTorch framework is used to build the deep learning model.

Additionally, it is worth noting that the skorch library, which is a scikit-learn compatible neural network library that wraps PyTorch, is used to keep the model training and analysis pipelines comparable. This allows the same scikit-learn training and evaluation procedure to be used for both models. Skorch is also helpful for end-users in CNN training, as it has a clear and simple interface.

In summary, the PyTorch framework, along with the skorch library, is used to build the deep learning model in this work.
