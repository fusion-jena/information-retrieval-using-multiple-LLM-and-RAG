Answer: In the context provided, the data augmentation (DA) techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not specified in detail. However, it is mentioned that the data augmentation techniques are used to artificially increase and diversify the training data, and that designed sets of data augmentations can significantly improve the generalization ability of the network.

One specific data augmentation method mentioned in the context is the Fast AutoAugment (FAA) method, which is used to improve the data in the study. The FAA method is an enhanced Auto augmentation method that automatically searches for optimal data augmentation policies. It consists of controllers, augmenters, and a baseline CNN model. The controller samples data augmentation policies from the searched space, the augmenter transforms the images of the dataset with the new policy, and the baseline CNN model trains the augmented images created with the new policy.

Additionally, it is mentioned that the CNN-based methods have better performance in identifying plants, but still, more attention should be paid to the modules that consider texture characteristics.

In terms of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling, the context does not provide specific information on which of these techniques were used. However, these techniques are commonly used in data augmentation for deep learning, especially in image classification tasks. Flipping refers to horizontally or vertically flipping the images, rotating refers to rotating the images by a certain degree, and scaling refers to changing the size of the images. These techniques help to increase the size of the training dataset, and also help the model to generalize better by providing variations of the original images.
