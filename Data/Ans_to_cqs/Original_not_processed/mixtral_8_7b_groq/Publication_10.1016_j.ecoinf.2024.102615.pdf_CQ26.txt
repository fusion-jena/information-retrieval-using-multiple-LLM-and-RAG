Answer:::

The provided context discusses various aspects of machine learning and deep learning techniques, including data preprocessing and model development, but it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide some insights into the data partitioning method used in a specific study.

The study mentioned in the context used a data partitioning ratio of 8:1:1 for training, validation, and testing sets, respectively. The random partition was repeated ten times to reduce the influence of random splitting while ensuring converged performance (Geras et al., 2017). Although this method does not directly address data bias, it does provide a way to ensure that the model's performance is not influenced by the specific data split used.

In general, there are several techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These techniques include:

1. Stratified splitting: This method involves dividing the data into subgroups based on the target variable's distribution. The data is then split randomly within each subgroup, ensuring that each subset has a similar distribution of the target variable.
2. Oversampling: This method involves increasing the number of instances in the minority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by duplicating instances or using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate new instances.
3. Undersampling: This method involves reducing the number of instances in the majority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of instances or using techniques like Tomek links to remove instances.
4. Diverse data collection: This method involves collecting data from various sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help to reduce bias and improve the model's generalizability.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, they are commonly used in practice to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
