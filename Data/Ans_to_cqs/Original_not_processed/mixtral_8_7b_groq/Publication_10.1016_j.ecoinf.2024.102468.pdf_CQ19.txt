Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used in building the WT-HMM model. The focus of the text is on the performance of the WT-HMM model with varying dataset sizes and the comparison of recording months for the task of detecting North Atlantic right whale up-calls.

However, it is worth noting that the authors of the Birdnet study, Kahl et al. (2021), mentioned using TensorFlow as the deep learning framework for their avian diversity monitoring project. Although this study is not directly related to the WT-HMM model, it suggests that TensorFlow is a possible framework used in the field of animal call detection and monitoring, which is relevant to the Ibrahim et al. (2018) study mentioned in the context.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state which deep learning framework was used for the WT-HMM model, TensorFlow is a possible framework based on the related study by Kahl et al. (2021). Nonetheless, without further information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
