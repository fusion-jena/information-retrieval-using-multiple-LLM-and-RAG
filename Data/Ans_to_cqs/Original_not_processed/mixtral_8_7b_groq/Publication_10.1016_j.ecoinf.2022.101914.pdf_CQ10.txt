Answer:::

 The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or any code repository link related to it. The article discusses the development of ensemble habitat selection models using six modeling approaches, categorized into regression-based and machine learning models. These models include Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Maximum Entropy software (MaxEnt). However, it does not mention any deep learning techniques or code repositories.
