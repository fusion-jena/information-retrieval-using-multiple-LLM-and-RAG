Answer:::

The provided context discusses various aspects of the deep learning pipeline used in the study, but it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used. However, based on common practices in deep learning, we can infer some optimization techniques that might have been applied.

One such technique is the use of a specific learning rate. The context mentions that the learning rate is set to 0.001, which is a common choice for many optimization algorithms. However, it does not specify which optimization algorithm this learning rate is used with.

Another technique that can be inferred from the context is the use of batch normalization. Batch normalization is a technique used to normalize the inputs to each layer of the neural network, which can help improve the training process and reduce the risk of overfitting.

The context also mentions the use of a rectified linear activation function, Leaky ReLU, after convolution or concatenate layers. While this is not an optimization technique per se, it can affect the optimization process by introducing non-linearity into the model and helping to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.

The use of different training epochs for models with different depths can also be seen as an optimization technique. By adjusting the number of training epochs based on the depth of the model, the researchers may be trying to prevent overfitting in shallow models while still allowing deeper models to train sufficiently.

As for the specific optimization techniques used, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam, the context does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion. However, based on common practices in deep learning, it is possible that one or both of these techniques were used in conjunction with the other techniques mentioned above.
