Answer:::

The specific deep learning frameworks used to build models for computational bioacoustics are not explicitly mentioned in the provided sources. However, based on the years of publication for the sources, it can be inferred that TensorFlow and PyTorch are likely to be the most commonly used frameworks.

TensorFlow, developed by Google Brain in 2015, is a popular open-source library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications. TensorFlow has been widely adopted in various fields, including bioacoustics, due to its flexibility, scalability, and robustness.

PyTorch, developed by Facebook's AI Research lab in 2016, is another popular open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library. It is known for its simplicity and ease of use, as well as its seamless transition between CPUs and GPUs. PyTorch has gained popularity in the research community due to its dynamic computation graph, which allows for greater flexibility and efficiency in building and training deep learning models.

In the context of computational bioacoustics, deep learning models have been used for various tasks, such as species-level classification of beaked whale echolocation signals (LeBien & Ioup, 2018; Li et al., 2020a) and passive acoustic survey of deep-diving odontocetes (Simonis, 2020). Although the specific deep learning frameworks used in these studies are not mentioned, it is highly likely that TensorFlow or PyTorch were used, given their widespread adoption and popularity in the machine learning community.
