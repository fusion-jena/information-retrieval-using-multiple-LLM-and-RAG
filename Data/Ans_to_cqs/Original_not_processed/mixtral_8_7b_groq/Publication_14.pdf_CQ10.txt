Answer:::
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes references to several papers and projects related to machine learning, but none of them provide a link to a code repository on GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other platform. The papers focus on presenting the methods, results, and conclusions of the research, but they do not include the source code used in the projects. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested link.
