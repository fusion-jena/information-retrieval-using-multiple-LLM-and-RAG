Answer:

The provided context does not give a direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some datasets used in previous studies related to bird species recognition.

The CUB-200-2011 dataset was used in studies by Kondaveeti (2023), Sitepu et al. (2022), Wang et al. (2023), and Wu et al. (2021). This dataset contains 11,788 images of 200 bird species. The Birdsnap dataset, mentioned in a study by Huang and Basanta (2019), is another source of bird images. It contains 11,788 images of 200 bird species.

Additionally, a study by Huang and Basanta (2021) used a dataset from online sources, which resulted in a high accuracy rate of 98.70%. The context also mentions a dataset by Wei et al. (2018) that uses a Mask Convolutional Neural Network (M-CNN) for bird species recognition.

However, there is no information provided about the data repository links for these datasets. It is recommended to check the original sources or papers for more information on the data repository links.
