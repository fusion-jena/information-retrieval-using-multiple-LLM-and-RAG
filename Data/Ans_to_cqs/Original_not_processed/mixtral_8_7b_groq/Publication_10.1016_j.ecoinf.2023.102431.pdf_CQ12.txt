The provided context does not mention the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers in the described pipeline. Instead, it appears that traditional machine learning techniques are used for variable selection and species or sex discrimination.

First, a predictor screening analysis using bootstrap forest partitioning is employed to evaluate the contribution of predictors on the response object. Then, a stepwise variable selection procedure is used to select the variables with the best discriminating power based on their F-ratios. Finally, linear discriminant analysis is used to generate a discrimination line or hyperplane depending on the number of variables in the resulting model to classify species or sex.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the answer to the query is:

Answer:::
No deep learning models such as CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers are used in the described pipeline. Instead, traditional machine learning techniques are used for variable selection and species or sex discrimination.
