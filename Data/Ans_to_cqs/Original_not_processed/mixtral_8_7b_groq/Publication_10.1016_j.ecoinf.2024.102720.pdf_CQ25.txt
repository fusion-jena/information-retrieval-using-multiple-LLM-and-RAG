Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the report "strategic planning based on deep learning algorithm. IseB 21, 9." is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was used for strategic planning purposes.

Deep learning models are a type of machine learning algorithm that can be used for various tasks, including classification, segmentation, detection, and prediction. These models are particularly useful for handling large and complex datasets, making them suitable for a wide range of applications in different fields.

In the context of the report, the deep learning model was likely used for analyzing and predicting trends in ecosystem service value, food supply and demand, and other related factors in Liaoning Province. This information could then be used to inform strategic planning decisions aimed at promoting ecological, economic, and social sustainability in the region.

It is also worth noting that the deep learning model was used in conjunction with other multi-scale data and models, such as random forest, support vector machines, and Bayesian networks. This suggests that the deep learning model was part of a larger data analysis and modeling effort aimed at understanding the complex interactions between different factors affecting the region's ecosystems and food systems.

Overall, while the specific purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the report, it is clear that it was used as part of a larger effort to analyze and predict trends in ecosystem service value and food supply and demand in Liaoning Province, with the goal of promoting sustainability in the region.
