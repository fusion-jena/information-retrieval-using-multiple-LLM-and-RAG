Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text mentions that the methods for noise reduction are manually tuned to maximize the evaluation metrics, but it does not specify the techniques used for this tuning, such as grid search, random search, or others. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question without additional information.
