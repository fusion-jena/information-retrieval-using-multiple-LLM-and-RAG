Answer:::

The provided context discusses various applications of deep learning in image processing and analysis, particularly in the segmentation of different targets such as brain tumors, maize plants, trees, mangroves, and wetlands. However, they do not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Nevertheless, I can provide some general techniques that are commonly used to address data bias, which include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria, such as class labels, and then randomly splitting each subgroup to maintain the same proportion of classes in both training and testing sets.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances from the minority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by replicating instances from the minority class or generating synthetic instances using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances from the majority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of instances from the majority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from various sources, domains, or scenarios to ensure that the dataset is representative of the target population.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, some of the papers discuss the importance of data quality and quantity in deep learning applications. For instance, Chen et al. (2021) emphasize the need for high-quality UAV-borne LiDAR data for individual tree crown segmentation, and Danielsen et al. (2005) highlight the importance of coastal vegetation data for predicting the impact of natural disasters. These studies suggest that data bias can be addressed by collecting diverse and high-quality data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, the literature suggests that stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are common techniques used to address data bias.
