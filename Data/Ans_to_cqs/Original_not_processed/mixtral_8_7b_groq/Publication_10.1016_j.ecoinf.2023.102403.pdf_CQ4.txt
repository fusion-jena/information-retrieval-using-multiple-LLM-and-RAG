The provided context does not give information about the data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on a study about fish body size and the data collection trends related to it. The data collection disparities and the process of refining and curating the data are discussed in detail. However, there is no mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.

Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning to increase the amount of training data, improve model accuracy, and prevent overfitting. These techniques create new training examples by applying random transformations to the existing data. For example, flipping involves horizontally flipping images, rotating involves rotating images by a certain angle, and scaling involves changing the size of images.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
