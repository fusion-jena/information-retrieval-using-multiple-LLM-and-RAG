Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses a study that uses a deep learning pipeline for target detection in images of Procapra przewalskii, and it describes the use of multiscale feature-extraction networks (MSNet) and Res2Net structures to improve feature extraction. However, it does not provide a link to a data repository where the pipeline or its results can be accessed. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
