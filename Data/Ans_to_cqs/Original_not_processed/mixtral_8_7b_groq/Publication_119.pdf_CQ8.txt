Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the use of a U-Net model implemented within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python as a solution to the challenges of training deep learning models with limited ground data for tropical forest monitoring. It explains how hyperparameter tuning and the use of a pretrained ResNet-50 backbone improve the model's accuracy and efficiency. However, there is no mention of where the code for this pipeline is stored or hosted. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
