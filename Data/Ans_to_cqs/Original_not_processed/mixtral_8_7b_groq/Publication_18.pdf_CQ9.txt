Answer:::

The data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not available in any of the mentioned data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. According to the information provided, the test and training datasets that support the findings of the study are available from a Github archive (<https://github.com/EGuirado/CNN-Whales-from-Space>). However, there are restrictions on the availability of the images of the training and validation data, which were used with permission for the current study but are not publicly available. Some data may be available from the authors upon reasonable request and under written permission from Google Earth, Arkive, or NOAA Photo Library when applicable.

Moreover, the study provides the metadata of all the images in the training and testing datasets in the Supplementary Information to allow reproducibility. However, the actual data repository for the deep learning pipeline is not specified.

Therefore, the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not publicly available, and access to some data may be requested from the authors under specific conditions.
