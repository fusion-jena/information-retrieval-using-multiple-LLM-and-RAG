The provided context does not contain specific information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of remote sensing data, specifically PlanetScope satellite imagery, in developing predictive models for estimating volumetric water content (VWC) in soils.

In the context of remote sensing, data annotation typically involves labeling or segmenting objects of interest in images, such as buildings, cars, or in this case, soil and vegetation types. Common annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, where a box is drawn around an object, and instance segmentation, where each instance of an object is separately segmented and labeled.

In the study, the authors used PlanetScope satellite imagery with a spatial resolution of 3.7 m at the nadir. They used one cloud-free imagery collected on 2020-08-2
