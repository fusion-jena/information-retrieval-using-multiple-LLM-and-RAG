Answer:::

The three datasets used in the deep learning pipeline of this study are ImageNet, Snapshot Serengeti (SS), and Lasha Mountain (LSM). ImageNet is a benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision, widely used for training and evaluating image recognition models. Each image in the ImageNet dataset is manually annotated, and the image sizes vary, with the largest size being 4288 × 2848 pixels and the smallest being 75 × 56 pixels. The ImageNet dataset used in this study is ImageNet-1 k, which contains 1000 classes and 1.2 million training samples. The pre-trained model on the ImageNet-1 k dataset was used as one of the source models for transfer learning.

The other two datasets, SS and LSM, are camera trap image datasets, where each time the camera is triggered, it captures multiple images in succession, called a capture event. These events frequently comprise three images, and images within the same event are significantly similar to each other. To prevent poor generalization of the DCNN model, the integrity of events was maintained during data splitting, putting all images of an event into the same dataset.
