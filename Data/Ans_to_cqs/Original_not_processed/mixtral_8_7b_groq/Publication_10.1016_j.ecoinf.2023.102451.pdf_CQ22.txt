Answer:::

The performance of deep learning models is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are commonly used to assess the effectiveness of a model in making predictions.

Accuracy measures the ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations. It is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of a model. However, it may not always provide an accurate representation of the model's performance, especially if the dataset is imbalanced.

Precision, on the other hand, measures the ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions made by the model. It is a useful metric when dealing with imbalanced datasets, as it provides a better representation of the model's performance in identifying positive observations.

Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positive observations in the dataset. It is a useful metric when the cost of missing a positive observation is high.

The F1-score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, which provides a balanced representation of both metrics. It is a useful metric when dealing with imbalanced datasets, as it takes into account both precision and recall.

In the given context, the performance of the EMViT-Net model is evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics. The model's performance is compared with other state-of-the-art models on the EMDS-6 dataset's validation and test sets. The EMViT-Net model outperforms other models in precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy on both the validation and test sets.

Therefore, to answer the query, the performance of deep learning models is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance in making predictions.
