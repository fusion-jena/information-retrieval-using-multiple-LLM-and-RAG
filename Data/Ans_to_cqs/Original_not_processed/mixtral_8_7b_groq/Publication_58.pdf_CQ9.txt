Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The study mentions the use of SPOT6 satellite data for land use (LU) and land cover (LC) classification, but it does not specify where this data can be accessed. Furthermore, it does not mention if and where the code, models, or other outputs of the deep learning pipeline are deposited.

The study does reference several papers and databases in the context, but these are not related to the data repository. For example, it cites a paper by Zhang et al. (2016) on deep learning for remote sensing data, a paper by Cheng et al. (2017) on remote sensing image scene classification, and a paper by Georganos et al. (2018) on very high resolution object-based land use-land cover urban classification using extreme gradient boosting. However, these papers do not contain information about the data repository of the current study.

Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
