Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does mention a few papers that use deep learning techniques for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification.

1. Ganjirad and Bagheri (2024) proposed a classification method for high-resolution remote sensing images based on NDVI deep learning fusion network.
2. Zhu et al. (2020) introduced So2Sat LCZ42, a benchmark data set for the classification of global local climate zones.
3. Zhu et al. (2021) mapped abandoned farmland in China using time series MODIS NDVI.

An examination of these papers might help locate the data repository. Among these, the So2Sat LCZ42 data set by Zhu et al. (2020) is available on IEEE Geoscience Remote Sens. Magazine. However, the other two studies do not explicitly mention the data repository.

To access the data sets and pipelines associated with these studies, it would be best to contact the authors directly or search for the data repositories using the paper titles and author names. Data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF can be searched for the specific data sets or codes.

Additionally, it is possible that the data sets are not publicly available due to privacy concerns, data usage agreements, or other restrictions. In such cases, access to the data might require permission from the data owners or a formal data sharing agreement.

In summary, while the So2Sat LCZ42 data set by Zhu et al. (2020) is available on IEEE Geoscience Remote Sens. Magazine, the data repositories for the other two studies mentioned in the context are not explicitly provided. To locate these data repositories, it is recommended to search the aforementioned data repositories, contact the authors directly, or seek permission from the data owners if necessary.
