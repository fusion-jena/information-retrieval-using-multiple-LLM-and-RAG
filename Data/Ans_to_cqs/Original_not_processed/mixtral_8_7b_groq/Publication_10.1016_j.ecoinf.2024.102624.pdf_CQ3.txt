The provided context does not give information about the specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some techniques used in remote sensing and machine learning for plant population classification.

In the context, data augmentation is mentioned as a technique used to enhance the generalization capabilities of training data. This involves extending the existing training data, which can help improve the model's performance on new, unseen data.

Post-classification techniques such as segmentation and filtering are also mentioned as ways to provide better maps with a lower rate of salt-and-pepper errors. These techniques can help refine the training samples and improve the overall accuracy of the classification.

In the context, the authors used random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) classifiers for plant population classification. They used a grid search to find the optimal hyperparameters for each classifier.

The authors also mention the challenges they faced in identifying plant populations using remote sensing in shallow and eutrophic water bodies, where there can be large variations in plant populations even within a small area.

Overall, while the context does not provide information on data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, it does mention some techniques used in remote sensing and machine learning for plant population classification.
