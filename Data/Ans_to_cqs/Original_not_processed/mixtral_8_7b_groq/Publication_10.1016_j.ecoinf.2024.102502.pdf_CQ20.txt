The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the training involves processing multi-petabyte EOS (Earth Observing System) data across several disciplines, including agriculture, forestry, and environmental studies. Given the scale and complexity of this data, it is likely that high-performance computing hardware, such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) or TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), are used for training the deep learning model. These hardware resources are well-suited for the large-scale data processing and matrix operations required in deep learning. However, without more specific information, this is just an educated guess based on the context provided.
