The provided context does not specifically mention the use of a deep learning model for species distribution analysis. However, it does discuss the process of implementing machine learning models for this purpose. Therefore, I will answer the query based on the general model deployment process rather than deep learning model serialization or platform selection.

Answer:
The context describes the use of seven different machine learning models for species distribution analysis, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART). The models were trained and validated using data from the third and fourth natural environment surveys, incorporating various environmental variables.

Before implementing the models, a correlation analysis of the variables was conducted to enhance the predictive performance and mitigate the risk of overfitting. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) values were extracted for each model both before and after urban development to assess their performance.

However, the context does not mention any specifics about model serialization or platform selection for deploying the trained models. In general, model serialization involves saving the trained model in a file format that can be easily loaded and used for making predictions. Platform selection depends on the intended use case and the resources available, such as cloud-based platforms, on-premises servers, or edge devices.

Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer regarding the process followed to deploy the trained machine learning models for species distribution analysis in this context.
