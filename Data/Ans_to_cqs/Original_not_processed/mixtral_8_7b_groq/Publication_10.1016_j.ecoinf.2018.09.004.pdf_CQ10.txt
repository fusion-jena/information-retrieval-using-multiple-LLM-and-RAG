Answer:::

 Based on the provided context, there is no information available about a deep learning pipeline or any code repository link (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) related to this study. The context describes a research paper titled "Seagrass detection in the Mediterranean: A supervised learning approach" by Dimitrios Effrosynidis, Avi Arampatzis, and Georgios Sylaios. The paper compares various machine learning classifiers for seagrass detection using a dataset from the Mediterranean Sea. However, it does not mention any deep learning techniques or code repositories.

 The methods used in the study include Passive-Aggressive, k-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Ridge, Linear SVC, Decision Tree, and Random Forest classifiers. The study evaluates these methods based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure. The dataset used in the study is a high-resolution geography database from the Global Self-consistent Hierarchical High-resolution Shoreline (GSHHS) database.

 Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline because it is not mentioned in the given context.
