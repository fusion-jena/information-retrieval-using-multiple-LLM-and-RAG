Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training in the study mentioned involves using a racy assessment that requires specific parameters to calculate the total number of training samples required for image classification using Eq. 1. The assessment includes computing the Error of Commission (EC), Error of Omission (EO), Producer Accuracy (PA), and User Accuracy (UA) based on an error matrix resulting from accuracy assessment.

EC represents classified values that were predicted to be in a particular class but do not belong to that class, while EO refers to items that are left out of their correct class in the classification. PA and UA supplement EO and EC, respectively. The study used an advanced accuracy assessment with the SCP (Semi-Automatic Classification Plug-in) functions for the RF classifier and generated a land cover classification map. After classification, a post-processing tool was run to obtain reports from each classifier, providing the pixel sum and area coverage of each land cover class.

Additionally, the study assumed that training samples should represent approximately 0.25% of the total study area used by the RF classifier for large-scale classification. This strategy allowed for the identification of errors in classification, which could be improved in future studies by acquiring more training areas that include the category of "new vineyard," as its spectral signature changes significantly after five years of growth.

However, the context does not explicitly mention a strategy for monitoring the model performance during training. The mentioned strategy focuses on the accuracy assessment after the classification process. Therefore, it can be inferred that the study may have used standard monitoring techniques during the training process, such as tracking the training and validation loss and accuracy over epochs. Nonetheless, the specifics of this monitoring strategy are not provided in the context.
