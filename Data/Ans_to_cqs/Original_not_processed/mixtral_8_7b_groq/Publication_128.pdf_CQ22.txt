Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include accuracy, and this is determined using the mean average (MA) top-1 accuracy. This metric measures the distance between the predicted labels and the labeled classes. Multiple samples are fed into the test model, and their inference labels, according to the highest score, are exported as their prediction labels. The accuracy is then calculated by averaging these outcomes. The formula for calculating the average accuracy is provided in the context, which involves a logic function to verify if the argmax index equals the instance label. However, the context does not mention the use of other metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, etc. to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
