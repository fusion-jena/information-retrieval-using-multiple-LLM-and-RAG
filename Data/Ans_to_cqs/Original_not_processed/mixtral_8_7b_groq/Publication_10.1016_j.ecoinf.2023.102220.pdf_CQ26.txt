Answer:::

The provided context discusses the development and evaluation of the Pest Biological Processes (PBP) method, a machine learning approach for pest monitoring, but it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of training-test splits of time series data and the evaluation of the model using accuracy, true positive rate, and false positive rate.

In general, there are several techniques that can be used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, including:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the data into folds while preserving the percentage of samples for each class. This ensures that each fold is a good representative of the whole dataset.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of samples in the minority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by randomly replicating samples from the minority class or by using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic samples.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of samples in the majority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of samples from the majority class or by using techniques such as NearMiss to select a subset of samples that are close to the minority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from multiple sources or under different conditions to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population.

It is possible that the developers of the PBP method used one or more of these techniques to address data bias during the preprocessing of their deep learning pipeline. However, without further information, it is not possible to confirm this.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it is common practice to use techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection to address data bias in deep learning.
