The context provided does not give information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It discusses the optimization algorithm Hyperband, which is an optimization strategy for hyperparameter tuning that aims to efficiently search the hyperparameter space by exploring several configurations in parallel and allocating more training resources to promising configurations.

The optimization process involves standardizing the data, determining a training base, and calculating and applying standardization parameters to other datasets used as test bases. The optimization algorithm is used to determine the best result, which in turn allows for the selection of the base that will be used for training.

The model architecture is described as having a large number of hyperparameters related to different types of layers, such as convolutional or recurrent layers. These hyperparameters are external to the neural network and remain static during the training process. The parameters, which are internal to the neural network and evolve during the training process, are also mentioned.

The context also states that the model is partially trained on a small fraction of the data to quickly eliminate underperforming configurations, and that the remaining configurations are grouped into sets and trained further, with the best-performing configurations being promoted to the next stage and underperforming configurations being eliminated. This process is repeated until only one configuration remains, which is considered the best configuration found.

However, the context does not mention any specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
