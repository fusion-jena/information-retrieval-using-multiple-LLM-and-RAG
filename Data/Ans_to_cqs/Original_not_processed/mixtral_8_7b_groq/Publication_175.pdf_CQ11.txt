Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on discussing the challenge of working with a limited dataset and introduces few-shots learning algorithms as a solution. It then explains the few-shots learning methods, including metric-based methods, which embed queries and support sets before assigning a class according to distances computed between them.

The context also describes an experiment using a deep ResNet model trained on a large AT0 dataset, achieving a mean accuracy of 78.00% on the T2 test-dataset. However, it does not mention the data repository link or any information about where the dataset or code can be accessed.

Therefore, I cannot provide the data repository link based on the given context. I recommend looking at the original research paper or associated resources for more information about the dataset and the deep learning pipeline.
