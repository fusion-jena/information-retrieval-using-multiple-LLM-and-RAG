Answer:::

The provided context does not mention the use of any specific cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform for deploying a deep learning model. Instead, it states that all the calculations were carried out using the DAFNE HPC scientific computing center of the Universit`a degli Studi della Tuscia. The system provides two Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) ProLiant DL560 Gen10 nodes, each equipped with four processors Intel Xeon Gold 5118 2.30GHz, 12 cores, 24 threads; and 512 GB of RAM. The two nodes worked in a parallel configuration managed by the Python 3.6.8 package Ray, version 1.9.2.

It's important to note that, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of a cloud platform, it's possible that the DAFNE HPC scientific computing center is a local high-performance computing cluster and not a cloud platform.

Additionally, the text describes the use of a genetic algorithm as part of the LS-MCMC-hybridGenAlgo for estimating and optimizing the results of the study, but it does not mention the use of a deep learning model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that the deep learning model was not deployed on any of the major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform) and it's not clear if it was deployed on a cloud platform or a local high-performance computing cluster.
