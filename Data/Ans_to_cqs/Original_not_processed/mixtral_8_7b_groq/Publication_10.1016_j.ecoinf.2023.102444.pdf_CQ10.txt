Answer:::
I am unable to provide the exact code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study, as it was not included in the provided context. However, based on the context, we know that the study used UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for species distribution modeling and visualization. UMAP is a dimensionality reduction technique that can be implemented in various programming languages such as Python.

For instance, the 'umap' package in Python can be used to implement UMAP. You can install it using pip or conda and then use it in your code. Here's a simple example of how to use UMAP for dimensionality reduction in Python:

```python
import umap
import numpy as np

# Generate some random data
data = np.random.rand(1000, 20)

# Initialize an UMAP model
model = umap.UMAP()

# Fit the model and transform the data
embedding = model.fit_transform(data)
```

In addition, the study used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for species distribution modeling based on remote sensing imagery. You can implement CNNs in Python using popular deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

For example, here's a simple CNN implemented in TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Define the input shape
input_shape = (28, 28, 1)

# Create the model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

You can search for the specific code repository used in the study by looking for repositories associated with the authors or affiliated institutions. Additionally, you can look for repositories that implement UMAP and CNNs for species distribution modeling and remote sensing imagery analysis.
