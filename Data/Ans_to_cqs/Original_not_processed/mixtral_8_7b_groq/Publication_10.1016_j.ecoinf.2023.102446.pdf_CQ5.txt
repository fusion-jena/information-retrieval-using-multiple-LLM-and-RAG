Based on the provided context, the datasets used in the study are not explicitly mentioned as being part of a deep learning pipeline such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the study focuses on half-hour temporal resolution flux tower data related to carbon sources and sinks.

The data was collected and processed by the researchers named Leena Khadke, Sandipan Mukherjee, Kireet Kumar, and Subimal Ghosh. The data curation and investigation were carried out by Leena Khadke, Sandipan Mukherjee, and Kireet Kumar, while the conceptualization, methodology, and supervision were handled by Subimal Ghosh.

The dataset includes various variables measured by the flux tower and is available with Dr. Sandipan Mukherjee and the competent authorities of G.B. Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment, Almora, Uttarakhand, India.

Therefore, the dataset used in this study is not a deep learning dataset such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, but rather a set of half-hour temporal resolution flux tower data related to carbon sources and sinks.
