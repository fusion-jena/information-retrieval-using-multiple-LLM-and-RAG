Answer:

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the information given, we can make some educated guesses about how the data might be split.

The data for the deep learning model training comes from two sources: Table 1, which provides wildfire events from the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) and was used to acquire training samples and validate the FIREMAP burned area (BA) product, and Table 5, which provides wildfire events from CEMS and was used to validate the vegetation recovery product in FIREMAP.

It is possible that the data was split based on the type of event (BA or vegetation recovery) or the location of the event. For example, the data might have been split so that a certain percentage of the BA events and a certain percentage of the vegetation recovery events were used for training, while the remaining events were used for testing and validation. Alternatively, the data might have been split based on geographical region, with a certain percentage of the events from each region used for training, and the remaining events used for testing and validation.

Another possible criterion for splitting the data is the date of the event. The context indicates that the wildfire events occurred at different times, ranging from 2017 to 2022. It is possible that the data was split so that events from certain time periods were used for training, while events from other time periods were used for testing and validation.

Without more information, it is difficult to say for sure how the data was split for deep learning model training. However, it is common practice to use a portion of the data for training, a portion for testing, and a portion for validation. This allows the model to be trained on some of the data, while also providing a way to evaluate its performance on unseen data.

In summary, while the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not provided in the context, it is likely that the data was split based on the type of event, the location of the event, or the date of the event.
