Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for soil organic carbon (SOC) prediction. However, I can provide some general information about common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning.

Data augmentation is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the diversity of data available for training models, without actually collecting new data. This is particularly useful in the field of computer vision, where images can be transformed in various ways to create new training examples. Some common data augmentation techniques include:

1. Flipping: This involves flipping the image horizontally or vertically. Horizontal flipping is a popular technique because it can help the model generalize better, as it can learn that the orientation of objects in the image does not affect the target variable.

2. Rotation: This involves rotating the image by a certain angle. This can help the model learn to recognize objects in different orientations, which can be useful in scenarios where the orientation of the object in the image is not fixed.

3. Scaling: This involves scaling the image up or down. This can help the model learn to recognize objects at different scales, which can be useful in scenarios where the size of the object in the image varies.

4. Translation: This involves shifting the image horizontally or vertically. This can help the model learn to recognize objects in different positions in the image.

5. Color jittering: This involves randomly changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue of the image. This can help the model learn to recognize objects in different lighting conditions.

It's important to note that the choice of data augmentation techniques depends on the specific problem and dataset at hand. In the context of SOC prediction, it's possible that the authors did not use any data augmentation techniques, or they used techniques that are specific to their dataset and problem. Without more information, it's difficult to say for sure.
