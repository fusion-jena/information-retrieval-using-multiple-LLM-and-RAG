Answer:::
The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the description of the architecture, which includes several layers that are characteristic of CNNs. These layers include convolution layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Additionally, the authors mention the use of filter sizes in the CNN architecture, which further supports the conclusion that a CNN is being used. The CNN is used for image classification, specifically for bee image classification, which serves different tasks in beehive monitoring. The authors propose four different models for this task, all based on pre-trained Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that have been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. These DNNs include AlexNet, DenseNet-201, GoogLeNet, ResNet-101, ResNet-18, VGG-16, and VGG-19. The CNN architecture used in the pipeline has six convolution layers, three pooling layers, and three fully connected layers. The Global Average Pooling layer is used to summarize features and generate input for the fully connected layer, which facilitates the visualization of regions relied upon by the network for predictions. The subsequent three fully connected layers generate the predicted class for the original image.
