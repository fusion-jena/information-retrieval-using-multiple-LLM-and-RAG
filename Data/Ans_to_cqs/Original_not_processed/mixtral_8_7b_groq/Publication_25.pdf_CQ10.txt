Answer:::
The code for the deep learning pipeline is available on GitHub. You can access the repository using the following link: <https://github.com/weecology/DeepLidar>. This repository contains the code used in the study, which includes the implementation of the semi-supervised pipeline for tree detection using LIDAR data. The code is archived on Zenodo with a digital object identifier (DOI) for citation and long-term access. The DOI for the archived code is [18]. By accessing the GitHub repository, you can view, download, and contribute to the development of the deep learning pipeline for tree detection.
