Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model in the study referred to by the provided context are mainly related to the configuration of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The hyperparameters and their ranges are as follows:

1. Convolution Layers: The number of convolution layers ranges from 1 to 10.
2. Filters: The number of filters (or kernels) ranges from 1 to 64.
3. Filter Size: The size of the filters ranges from 1 to 10.
4. Number of Neurons: The number of neurons in the range of 32 to 1024.
5. Batch Size: The batch size ranges from 8 to 512.
6. Epochs: The number of epochs ranges from 1 to 25.
7. CNN Model Optimizer: The optimizer for the CNN model can be selected from a set of six options: ADAM, SGD, RMSProp, Adadelta, Adagrad, and Adamax.

These hyperparameters were explored using a hybrid nature-inspired algorithm, HPB3C-3PGA, to find the optimal configuration for plant leaf image classification. The results showed that the optimized hyperparameters significantly improved the accuracy compared to random-tuned hyperparameters.

It is important to note that the context does not explicitly mention other common hyperparameters such as learning rate, regularization techniques (e.g., L1, L2), or activation functions. However, it is possible that some of these hyperparameters were set to default values or optimized within the chosen optimizer (e.g., learning rate in ADAM).
