Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the study does not specify the use of any particular type of deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer in the pipeline. The context only mentions the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as one of the four machine learning models. ANNs are not considered deep learning models as they do not have multiple hidden layers. Deep learning models, including CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers, have multiple hidden layers, enabling them to learn more complex patterns from data. Therefore, it can be concluded that the study does not use any deep learning models in the pipeline.
