Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study "Deep learning-based air pollution analysis on carbon monoxide in Taiwan." The context includes the title, authors, and a part of the study related to the analysis of forecasting results, but it does not mention any data repository or data availability details.

It is important to note that researchers should make their data publicly available to promote transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in the scientific community. If the data is not available in the paper or through the journal, it is recommended to contact the authors directly to inquire about the data availability.

In some cases, researchers may deposit their data in open-access repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, among others. These repositories provide a permanent and citable identifier for the dataset, making it easy for other researchers to access and use the data. However, in this case, there is no information available about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study.
