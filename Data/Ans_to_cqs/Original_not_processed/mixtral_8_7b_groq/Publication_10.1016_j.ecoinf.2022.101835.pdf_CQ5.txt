Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. It mainly focuses on the comparison of machine learning algorithms, specifically Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), in predicting first flowering date and full blossom date.

The authors mentioned that they optimized the structure and hyperparameters of the RF and ANN models using Optuna, and for the LightGBM models, they used Optuna's LightGBM Tuner for hyperparameter fitting. However, the context does not mention any specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline.
