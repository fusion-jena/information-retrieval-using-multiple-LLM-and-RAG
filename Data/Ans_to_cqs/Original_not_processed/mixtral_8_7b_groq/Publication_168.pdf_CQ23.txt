Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, there are some implicit indications that suggest that cross-validation and diverse datasets might have been used.

Firstly, the context mentioned that deep learning methods have been used to solve the HSI classification task and achieved remarkable achievements. Among these methods, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely explored. This suggests that multiple models might have been trained and tested on different datasets.

Secondly, the context mentioned that a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D-CNN) was designed for HSI classification based on the spectral feature of HSI. Although the structure of the designed 1-D-CNN is simple, it achieved a satisfactory classification performance. This implies that the model might have been trained and tested on a diverse dataset with different spectral features.

Thirdly, the context mentioned that a hybrid deep learning model, HybridSN, was proposed for HSI classification, which firstly uses the 3-D convolutional to extract the joint spatial-spectral features and then uses the 2-D convolutional to learn more abstract-level spatial representation. This suggests that the model might have been trained and tested on a dataset with both spatial and spectral features.

Therefore, while there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models for HSI classification, the context suggests that cross-validation and diverse datasets might have been used. However, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer without more information.
