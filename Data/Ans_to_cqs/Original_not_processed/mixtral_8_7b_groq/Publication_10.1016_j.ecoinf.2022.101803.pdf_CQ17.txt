The provided context discusses regularization methods in the context of machine learning models, including maximum likelihood (ML) parameter estimation and XGBoost. However, it does not directly mention regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines such as dropout and L2 regularization.

In general, regularization methods are used in machine learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which encourages the model to have simpler weights and avoid memorizing the training data.

In the context of deep learning, two common regularization methods are dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out, or sets to zero, a fraction of the neurons in a layer during training. This helps prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons and promoting the learning of more robust features. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the L2 norm of the model weights. This encourages the model to have smaller weights and avoid overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly mention dropout and L2 regularization, these are common regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting.
