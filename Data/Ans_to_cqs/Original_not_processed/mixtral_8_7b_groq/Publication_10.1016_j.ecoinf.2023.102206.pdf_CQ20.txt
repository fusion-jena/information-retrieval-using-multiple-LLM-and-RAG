The provided context does not include specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text focuses mainly on the proposed Intuitionistic Fuzzy Transfer Learning (IFTL) methodology for predicting GDP using carbon emission data. It mentions machine learning and transfer learning techniques but does not specify the hardware resources used for training the models.

In general, deep learning models often require substantial computational power for training, which is provided by specialized hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). GPUs are popular for deep learning due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which is beneficial for handling the large number of computations required in deep learning models. TPUs, on the other hand, are custom-built by Google for machine learning tasks and are optimized for tensor operations, which are the fundamental operations in deep learning models.

Therefore, while the provided context does not specify the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, it is common practice to use GPUs or TPUs for deep learning tasks due to their computational advantages.
