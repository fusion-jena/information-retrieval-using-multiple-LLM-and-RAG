The provided context discusses various applications of deep learning techniques in agricultural and marine environments, but it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide some insights into data preprocessing and data collection methods that can help reduce bias.

In the paper "Marine data and exploring explainability of a fully convolutional neural network using principal component analysis" (Eco. Inform. 62, 101269), the authors mention the importance of data preprocessing and feature extraction for reducing bias and improving model performance. They used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction, which can help reduce the dimensionality of the data and eliminate redundant features, thus reducing the risk of overfitting and bias.

In the paper "An affordable and easy-to-use tool for automatic fish length and weight estimation in mariculture" (Sci. Rep. 12 (1)), the authors mention the importance of data collection in reducing bias. They used a digital stereo-video camera system for three-dimensional monitoring of fish, which can help collect diverse and unbiased data. This method of data collection can help ensure that the data used for training the deep learning model is representative of the population and reduces the risk of bias.

In the paper "Estimating dimensions of free-swimming fish using 3D point distribution models" (Comput. Vis. Image Underst. 79 (1)), the authors mention the importance of data preprocessing and feature extraction for reducing bias. They used a 3D point distribution model for feature extraction, which can help reduce the dimensionality of the data and eliminate redundant features, thus reducing the risk of overfitting and bias.

In the paper "A digital stereo-video camera system for three-dimensional monitoring of free-swimming Pacific bluefin tuna, Thunnus orientalis, cultured in a net cage" (Aquat. Living Resour. 24 (2)), the authors mention the importance of data collection in reducing bias. They used a digital stereo-video camera system for three-dimensional monitoring of fish, which can help collect diverse and unbiased data. This method of data collection can help ensure that the data used for training the deep learning model is representative of the population and reduces the risk of bias.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, it does provide insights into data preprocessing and data collection methods that can help reduce bias. By using feature extraction techniques such as PCA and 3D point distribution models, and by collecting diverse and unbiased data, researchers can reduce the risk of bias in their deep learning models.
