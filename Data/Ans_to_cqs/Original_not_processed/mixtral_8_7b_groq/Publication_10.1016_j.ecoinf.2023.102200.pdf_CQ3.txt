Deep learning techniques in remote sensing and image processing often require annotated data for training. There are various data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, including bounding box annotation and instance segmentation.

Bounding box annotation is a technique where rectangular boxes are drawn around objects of interest in an image. This method is commonly used in object detection tasks, where the goal is to locate and identify objects within an image. For instance, Jin et al. (2018) used bounding box annotation to segment individual maize plants from terrestrial LiDAR data. They employed Faster R-CNN, a popular deep learning algorithm for object detection, to detect and segment maize plants based on the bounding box annotations.

Instance segmentation, on the other hand, is a more advanced technique that involves not only detecting objects but also segmenting each instance of the object in the image. This method generates a mask for each object instance, allowing for pixel-level classification. In the context of remote sensing, instance segmentation can be used for individual tree crown segmentation or mangrove tree segmentation. For example, Martins et al. (2021) used machine learning and SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) for tree canopies segmentation in urban areas, while Chen et al. (2021) used PointNet of deep learning for individual tree crown segmentation directly from UAV-borne LiDAR data.

In some cases, traditional algorithms like Marker-Controlled Watershed Segmentation (MCWS) and Region Growing (RG) are used for annotation. However, these methods may not always yield satisfactory results, especially in dense mangrove forests. Yin and Wang (2019) reported poor individual mangrove tree segmentation results (accuracy of <35%) when using traditional MCWS and RG algorithms on LiDAR-derived CHM data.

Deep learning techniques like 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and R-CNN have shown promising results in object detection and segmentation tasks. These techniques can potentially improve the accuracy of annotation in remote sensing applications, such as mangrove forest monitoring and individual tree segmentation.

In summary, data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include bounding box annotation for object detection and instance segmentation for pixel-level classification. Deep learning algorithms like Faster R-CNN, 3D CNNs, and R-CNN have been successfully applied in remote sensing applications for object detection and segmentation tasks.
