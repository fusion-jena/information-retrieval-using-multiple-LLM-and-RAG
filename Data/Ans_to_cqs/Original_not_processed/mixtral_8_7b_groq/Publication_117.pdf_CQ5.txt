Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for the specific task of counting wildebeest in survey images, as described in the given context, are the Enlighten: Research Data, the Zooniverse data, and the COCO dataset.

The Enlighten: Research Data provides the raw count data of the wildebeest in the survey images, which is used as the ground truth for evaluating the performance of the deep learning model. The Zooniverse data, on the other hand, is a crowd-sourced data collected by citizen scientists, which is used to create the training sets for the deep learning model. Specifically, 500 survey images were selected at random and tiled into 864 Ã— 864 subimages, and then passed through a version of the YOLO DCNN using pretrained weights from the COCO dataset.

The COCO dataset, provided by Redmon & Farhadi (2018), is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. It contains 330,000 images with 1.5 million object instances, and provides pretrained weights for the YOLO DCNN. These pretrained weights were used to extract relevant features from the Zooniverse data, which were then used to train the deep learning model for counting wildebeest in survey images.

Therefore, in this specific deep learning pipeline, the Enlighten: Research Data, the Zooniverse data, and the COCO dataset were used in conjunction to create a training set, extract relevant features, and evaluate the performance of the model.
