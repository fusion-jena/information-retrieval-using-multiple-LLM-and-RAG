The provided context discusses a data processing and classification method used in a study, but it does not mention any criteria used to split data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.

In general, when developing deep learning models, it is crucial to split the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is employed to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is utilized to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

The criteria used to split the data can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset size, and domain knowledge. Some common methods include:

1. Random sampling: Data points are randomly selected and assigned to each subset. This method is simple and unbiased but may not be suitable for time-series data or datasets with inherent structures.
2. Stratified sampling: Data points are divided into subsets based on their class distribution or other relevant features. This method ensures that each subset has a similar distribution of classes or features, reducing the risk of bias or poor performance on specific subsets.
3. Time-series splitting: For time-series data, data points are split based on time. The training set consists of earlier data points, the validation set includes intermediate data points, and the testing set contains the latest data points. This method preserves the temporal order of the data and allows for the evaluation of the model's ability to predict future events.
4. K-fold cross-validation: The dataset is divided into K subsets or folds. The model is trained on K-1 folds, and the remaining fold is used for validation. This process is repeated K times, with each fold serving as the validation set once. The average performance across all K runs is then calculated. This method reduces the risk of overfitting and provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

In conclusion, the provided context does not contain information on the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. However, some common methods for splitting data include random sampling, stratified sampling, time-series splitting, and K-fold cross-validation. The choice of splitting method depends on the specific problem, dataset size, and domain knowledge.
