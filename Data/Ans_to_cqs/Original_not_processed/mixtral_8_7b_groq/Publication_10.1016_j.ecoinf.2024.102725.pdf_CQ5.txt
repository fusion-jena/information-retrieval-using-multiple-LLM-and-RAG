Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline used in the study does not involve any of the standard datasets commonly used in deep learning model training such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, this study focuses on the application of deep learning techniques for improved Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) reconstruction and long-term vegetation cover study in the Danjiang River basin.

The dataset used in this study is the MCD43A4 V6.1 data for satellite path h27v06, spanning from October 29, 2022, to December 20, 2022. The data was obtained from the Google Earth Engine platform and pre-processed through mosaicking and clipping. The pre-processed data was then used for NDVI reconstruction using a deep learning-enhanced fusion method.

The study introduces a new high-quality NDVI image product and a technical framework for regularizing dense-time-series data with high spatial resolution. The framework offers a feasible method for reconstructing cloud-free high-resolution NDVI datasets. Using the SOWCEM technology framework, the study successfully produces a Sentinel-2 normalized NDVI time-series dataset with a 10 m spatial resolution for crop growth physiological cycles.

Therefore, the dataset used in this study is a specific satellite dataset (MCD43A4 V6.1) for the Danjiang River basin, and it is not one of the standard deep learning datasets.
