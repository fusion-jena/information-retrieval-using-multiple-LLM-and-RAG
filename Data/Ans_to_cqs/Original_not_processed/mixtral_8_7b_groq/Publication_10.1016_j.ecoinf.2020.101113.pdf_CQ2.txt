Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline described in the study primarily uses time-frequency spectrogram images as input data for training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The spectrograms are derived from audio recordings, suggesting that the original raw data format is audio.

The study mentions that the CNN model used requires equally-sized input images, and the authors chose a time-frequency window size of 2 seconds for the input images. This indicates that the spectrogram images are likely generated by dividing the audio recordings into 2-second segments and then converting each segment into a spectrogram image.

There is no explicit mention of using other data formats such as video or CSV files in the deep learning pipeline. However, the study does mention the use of CSV files for storing and reporting the results of the model's performance.

It is worth noting that the study also discusses potential modifications and improvements to the pipeline, such as introducing recurrent connections in the CNN or using data augmentation techniques. These modifications could potentially involve using different data formats, such as adding noise or other audio recordings to the training data. However, the study does not provide specific details on these potential modifications.

In summary, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the study is time-frequency spectrogram images derived from audio recordings. There is no explicit mention of using other data formats such as video or CSV files in the pipeline, although CSV files are used for reporting results.
