The provided context does not specifically mention the type of hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context only mentions that a deep learning-based retrieval of forest was used in a study, but it does not provide information about the hardware used for training the model.

Answer:::
The context does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The study focused on the comparison of machine-learning methods for above-ground biomass estimation based on Landsat imagery and did not mention any details about the hardware used for training the deep learning model.

Answer:::
The study "Deep learning based retrieval of forest" used deep learning methods but it does not specify the hardware resources used for training the model. The study utilized a training-and-test approach with stratification splitting, tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set, and model training using an optimal setting of the hyperparameter. However, it does not provide information about the hardware used for training the deep learning model.

Answer:::
The context does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The study used four methods to model forest AGB (AdaBoost, random decision forest, multilayer neural network, and Bayesian ridge regression) but it does not mention any details about the hardware used for training the models.

Answer:::
Based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context focuses on the comparison of machine-learning methods for above-ground biomass estimation based on Landsat imagery and does not provide information about the hardware used for training the deep learning model.
