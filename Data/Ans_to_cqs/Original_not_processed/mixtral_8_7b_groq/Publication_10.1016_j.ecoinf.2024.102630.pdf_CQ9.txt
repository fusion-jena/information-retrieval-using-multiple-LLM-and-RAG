Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context focuses mainly on the description of the study area, data sources, and processing methods for NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) datasets. It includes information about various NDVI datasets, such as MOD13Q1 V6, CDR AVHRR NDVI V5, GIMMS NDVI, and SPOT NDVI, which were sourced from platforms like Google Earth Engine, NOAA, and the Resource and Environmental Data Center of Chinese Academy of Sciences.

However, the context does not mention any details about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query. It is recommended to contact the authors of the study or consult the full paper for more information about the data repository.
