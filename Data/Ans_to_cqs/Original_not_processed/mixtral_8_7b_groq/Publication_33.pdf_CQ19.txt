Answer:::

The context provided does not specify which particular framework was used to build the deep learning model for species identification. However, it does mention TensorFlow in the references, which is a popular open-source framework for building and deploying ML models. It's often used for large-scale machine learning, as described in the paper "Tensorflow: A system for large-scale machine learning" by Abadi et al., referenced as [43]. So, it's possible that TensorFlow was used to build the model, but the context does not confirm this.
