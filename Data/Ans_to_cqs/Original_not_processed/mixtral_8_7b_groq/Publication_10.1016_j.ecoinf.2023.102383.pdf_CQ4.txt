Answer:::

While the provided context does not directly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it does discuss the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for object detection and recognition. In the context of object detection and image processing, common data augmentation techniques include Flipping, Rotating, and Scaling.

Flipping refers to horizontally or vertically flipping the input images to increase the diversity of the training data. This technique can help the model generalize better and reduce overfitting.

Rotating involves rotating the input images by a certain angle, which can help the model learn to recognize objects from different viewpoints.

Scaling changes the size of the input images, which can help the model learn to recognize objects at different scales.

These techniques can be used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset, which can help improve the model's performance and reduce overfitting. Additionally, data augmentation can help ensure that the model is robust to various image transformations and can generalize well to new, unseen data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, common techniques include Flipping, Rotating, and Scaling. These techniques can help increase the diversity of the training data, improve the model's performance, and reduce overfitting.
