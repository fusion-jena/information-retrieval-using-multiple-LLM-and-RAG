The provided context does not contain specific information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of several machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) for predicting various vegetation indices and chlorophyll content.

In general, hyperparameters are configuration variables that are set before the learning process begins. These parameters control the training process and can have a significant impact on the final performance of the model. Common hyperparameters in deep learning models include learning rate, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, optimizer, activation function, and regularization parameters.

The learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters in deep learning models. It determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. The optimizer is another important hyperparameter that determines how the parameters of the model are updated during training. Common optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.

Without more specific information about the deep learning model being used, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query. However, it is important to note that hyperparameter tuning is a critical step in the training of deep learning models and can significantly impact the final performance of the model.
