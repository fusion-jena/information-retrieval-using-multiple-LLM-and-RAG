Answer:

The provided pieces of context do not contain information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline for fish biomass estimation. The paper by Zhang et al., 2024, titled "Fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on deep neural network" (Eco. Inform. 79, 102399), mentions the development of a deep learning pipeline for fish biomass estimation but does not provide a link to the code repository. It is possible that the authors have not made the code publicly available, or it may be hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the code repository.
