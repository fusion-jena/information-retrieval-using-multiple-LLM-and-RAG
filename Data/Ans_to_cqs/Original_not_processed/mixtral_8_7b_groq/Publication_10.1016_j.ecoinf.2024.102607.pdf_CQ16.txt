Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the comparison of land use and land cover (LULC) classification results from different experiments and models.

However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use validation loss plateau as an indicator of a well-trained model. This method involves monitoring the loss function (e.g., cross-entropy loss) on a validation dataset during the training process. If the loss value does not decrease significantly over a certain number of epochs, it suggests that the model has reached a state where further training is unlikely to improve its performance. At this point, the training process can be considered complete.

In the context of LULC classification, the authors compare different models and techniques to improve the classification accuracy. They use overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient as evaluation metrics. However, they do not mention specific training termination criteria. It is possible that they used a validation loss plateau or another method to determine when training was complete, but this information is not provided in the context.
