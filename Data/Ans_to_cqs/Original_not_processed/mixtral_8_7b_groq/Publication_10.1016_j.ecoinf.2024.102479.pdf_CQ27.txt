Based on the information provided, there is no specific detail about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, the context does mention the training of models, including an artificial neural network (Model 6), and the tuning of hyperparameters for each model.

In general, deploying a trained deep learning model involves several steps, which may include:

1. Model serialization: This step involves saving the trained model to a file, allowing it to be stored and loaded for later use. Model serialization can be done using various formats, such as JSON, XML, or specific formats provided by deep learning frameworks (e.g., h5 for Keras, pickle for scikit-learn).

2. Platform selection: The deployed model can be executed on different platforms, depending on the use case. Common platforms include local machines, servers, or cloud-based services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure). The selection of the platform depends on factors such as computational requirements, data security, and cost.

3. Model deployment: After serialization and platform selection, the model is deployed, meaning it is made available for making predictions on new data. This can be done through various methods, such as creating a REST API, embedding the model in a web application, or using the model in a batch processing pipeline.

4. Model monitoring and maintenance: Once the model is deployed, it is essential to monitor its performance and maintain it over time. Monitoring can include tracking metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, as well as identifying and addressing any potential issues (e.g., concept drift, data quality). Maintenance may involve updating the model with new data, retraining the model, or adjusting the model's parameters.

Based on the context, it can be inferred that the training of the deep learning model (Model 6) involved the tuning of hyperparameters such as the number of hidden layers, the number of neurons per layer, and the threshold value. However, the specific details about the model deployment process are not provided.
