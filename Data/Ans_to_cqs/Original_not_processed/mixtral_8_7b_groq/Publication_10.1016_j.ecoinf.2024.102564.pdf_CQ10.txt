Answer:::

 Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a specific code repository link for it. The context includes several papers about forests, including tropical forests in Brazil, and the use of machine learning methods like Random Forests for modeling net growth. However, none of these papers provide a link to a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the deep learning pipeline as requested in the query.
