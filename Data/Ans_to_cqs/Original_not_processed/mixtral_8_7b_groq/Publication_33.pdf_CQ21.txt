Based on the provided context, the post-processing steps involved after the model training include the computation of confidence thresholds and the application of a post-processing framework to transform classification options.

After the model training phase, for each image in the threshold tuning dataset, the classifier provides an output consisting of the class (species) with the highest classification score and the score itself. Since the ground truth for each image is known, a confidence threshold can be computed for each class using this information.

Subsequently, a post-processing framework is applied to transform the classification options into three types of results: correct, misclassified, and unsure. This framework involves setting a confidence threshold for each class to obtain these three types of results. The goal is to transform as many misclassifications as possible into "Unsure" while preventing too many correct classifications from being transformed into "Unsure."

However, the context does not mention any specific post-processing steps such as saliency maps or metrics calculation. Additionally, there is no explicit mention of a confusion matrix. Therefore, based on the provided context, the post-processing steps involved after the model training are limited to the computation of confidence thresholds and the application of the post-processing framework.
