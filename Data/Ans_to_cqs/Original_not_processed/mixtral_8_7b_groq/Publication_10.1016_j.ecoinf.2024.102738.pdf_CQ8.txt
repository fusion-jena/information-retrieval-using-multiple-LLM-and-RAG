Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context consists of geographical and geoscientific data, including datasets, spectral bands, vegetation indices, and land use/land cover (LULC) classifications. While there is a mention of a study involving the Amazon forest and land use changes, there is no reference to any code repositories or deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
