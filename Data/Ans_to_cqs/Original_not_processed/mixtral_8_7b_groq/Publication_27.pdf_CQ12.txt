The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, there are some indications that the model might be a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or a combination of CNN and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

Firstly, the context mentions the use of "convolutional layers" which are typically used in CNNs for feature extraction. Specifically, it mentions "convolutional layers with 3x3 filters" and "zero-padding" which are common techniques used in CNNs.

Secondly, the context also mentions the use of "bidirectional LSTM" layers which are a type of RNN. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of RNN that is capable of learning long-term dependencies, making it suitable for sequential data.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is likely to be a combination of CNN and RNN, where the CNN part is responsible for feature extraction and the RNN part is responsible for learning sequential dependencies. However, this is an inference based on the provided context and not an explicit statement.
