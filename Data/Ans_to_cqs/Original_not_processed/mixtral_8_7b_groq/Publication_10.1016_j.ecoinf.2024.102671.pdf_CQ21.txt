Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about postprocessing steps involved after training a model, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, I can provide some insights based on the ecological risk assessment and prioritization studies mentioned in the context.

In the context of Li, Y.N., Duo, L.H., Zhang, M., Yang, J.Y., Guo, X.F., 2022, the authors used the InVEST model for habitat quality assessment. Postprocessing steps for models like InVEST might include:

1. Model Validation: Validate the model's performance using appropriate statistical methods and ecological indicators.
2. Mapping: Generate maps illustrating the spatial distribution of habitat quality, carbon sink density, or ecological risk.
3. Metrics Calculation: Calculate various metrics, such as the total area of different zones, average carbon sink density, or risk levels.

In the study by Lehtom√§ki and Moilanen (2013) and Srivathsa et al. (2023), the ZONATION 5.0 model was used for prioritizing ecological carbon sink areas. Postprocessing steps for this kind of model might include:

1. Weighted Elimination Risk Curve: Generate a weighted elimination risk curve to identify landscape units with escalating risks as priority protection zones for ecological carbon sinks.
2. Zonation Map: Create a map illustrating the priority order of different landscape units.
3. Area and Risk Analysis: Analyze the area and risk levels associated with different priority zones.

For ecological risk assessment studies, such as Malekmohammadi and Blouchi (2014), postprocessing steps might include:

1. Model Validation: Validate the model's performance using appropriate statistical methods.
2. Risk Map Generation: Generate maps illustrating the spatial distribution of ecological risk levels.
3. Confusion Matrix: Calculate a confusion matrix to assess the accuracy of the risk assessment model, if appropriate.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific postprocessing steps for the models used, it is common practice to validate models, generate maps, calculate metrics, and assess model performance using methods such as confusion matrices.
