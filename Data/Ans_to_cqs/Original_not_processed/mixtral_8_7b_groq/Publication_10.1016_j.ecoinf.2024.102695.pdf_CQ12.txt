Answer:::
The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Transformer. This information can be inferred from the different sections provided, but it is most explicitly stated in section 3.4.3. Here, the text mentions that "The decoder layer in the Transformer adds encoder-decoder attention, focusing on the encoder's output." Earlier in the text, in section 3, the authors also mention that they use a Transformer-based architecture in their study. Therefore, it is clear that the Transformer model is the one utilized in this pipeline.
