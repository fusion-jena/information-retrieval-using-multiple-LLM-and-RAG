Based on the provided context, there is no specific information given about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for the classification of LiDAR and UAV points clouds for DTM creation and flood risk mapping in the publication "Assessment of deep learning based classification of LiDAR and UAV points clouds for DTM creation and flood risk mapping. Geosciences 9, 323."

However, the paper "Marrs, J., Ni-Meister, W., 2019. Machine learning techniques for tree species classification using co-registered LiDAR and hyperspectral data. Remote Sens. 11, 819" discusses the use of machine learning techniques for tree species classification using co-registered LiDAR and hyperspectral data, but it does not provide specific details on the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.

In general, hyperparameters used in deep learning models can include learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of units in each layer, activation function, batch size, and number of epochs. The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. The optimizer is used to update the weights and biases of the model based on the gradient of the loss function. The number of layers and number of units in each layer determine the complexity of the model. The activation function is used to introduce non-linearity into the model. Batch size is the number of samples to work through before updating the model's weights. The number of epochs is the number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.

It's important to note that the choice of hyperparameters can have a significant impact on the performance of the deep learning model. Therefore, it is common practice to use techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to find the optimal set of hyperparameters for a given problem.
