Answer:

The article does not specify the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. The study focuses on comparing the performance of two commonly used algorithms for Species Distribution Models (SDMs), Generalised Linear Models (GLM) and Random Forest (RF), in predicting the habitat suitability of felid species in Southeast Asia. The authors test the models using different training data bootstrapping and spatial scale optimization techniques. Therefore, the article does not provide information on the use of deep learning models.
