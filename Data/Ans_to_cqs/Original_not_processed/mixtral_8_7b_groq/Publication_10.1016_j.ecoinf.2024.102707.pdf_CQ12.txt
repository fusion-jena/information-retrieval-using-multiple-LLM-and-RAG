Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipelines mentioned is primarily Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). 

In the study by Le, H., Samaras, D., Lynch, H.J., (2022), a CNN architecture is designed for the automated survey of seabird colonies. Similarly, Peng, J., Wang, D., Liao, X., Shao, Q., Sun, Z., Yue, H., Ye, H., (2020) used a modified Faster R-CNN, which is a type of CNN, for kiang detection in Tibetan plateau using UAS imagery. 

Moreover, in the context, there is no mention of using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers in the described pipelines. However, it is important to note that the choice of deep learning model largely depends on the specific task and data at hand. Therefore, while CNNs are prevalent in these studies, other models like RNNs or Transformers could be used in different contexts.
