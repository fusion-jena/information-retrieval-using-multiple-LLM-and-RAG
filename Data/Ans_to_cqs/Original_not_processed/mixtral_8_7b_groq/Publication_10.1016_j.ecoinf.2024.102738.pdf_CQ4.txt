Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data augmentation techniques such as Flipping, Rotating, or Scaling being applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the datasets used, spectral bands, vegetation, soil, and water indices, LULC classes, and the sampling strategy for training and testing samples. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to the query.

However, it is important to note that data augmentation techniques like Flipping, Rotating, and Scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, particularly in the field of computer vision, to increase the size and variability of the training dataset. These techniques help improve the model's ability to generalize and reduce overfitting. But, without further information specific to this case, I cannot confirm if these methods were applied.
