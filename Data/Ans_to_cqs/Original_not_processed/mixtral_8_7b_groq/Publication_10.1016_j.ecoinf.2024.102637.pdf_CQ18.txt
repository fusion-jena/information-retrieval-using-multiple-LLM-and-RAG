Answer: During the training of the model, the performance is monitored using several evaluation indicators. These indicators include testing accuracy, inference time, precision, recall, specificity, F1 score, and sensitivity. The testing accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions out of all the samples tested. Inference time is the time taken by the model to make a prediction. Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives. Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the actual number of positives. Specificity is the ratio of true negative predictions to the actual number of negatives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Sensitivity is the same as recall. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance during the training phase. Additionally, the learning rate was optimized using the Adam optimizer, and a cross-entropy loss function was adopted. The batch size was set to 16. The number of epochs for the AlexNet and SIAlex models was set to 200. The Birdsdata dataset, which contains 20 types of bird sounds collected both indoors and outdoors, was used for training and testing the model. The λ hyperparameter is used to adjust the balance relationship between the nonlinear factors of the activation function and the identity mapping of A'(x) based on the number of training iterations. As the training progresses, λ gradually approaches 1, integrating nonlinear factors into the model, which lays the foundation for future model optimization and performance improvement.
