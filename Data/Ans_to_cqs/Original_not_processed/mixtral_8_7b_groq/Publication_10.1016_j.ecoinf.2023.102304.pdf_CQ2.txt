The provided context does not contain information about the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of remote sensing data in the context of wildfire detection and vegetation analysis. Specifically, it mentions the use of various spectral bands and vegetation indices such as NDVI, EVI, NBR, and LTR. These indices are likely calculated from multi-spectral or hyperspectral image data, which are common data formats used in remote sensing applications.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of the Google Earth Engine platform for geospatial analysis, which can handle various data formats including raster and vector data. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of audio, video, or CSV formats in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline for wildfire detection and vegetation analysis likely uses remote sensing image data in the form of spectral bands and vegetation indices. However, the context does not provide enough information to determine whether other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV are used in the pipeline.
