Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no specific deep learning pipeline data repository link given. However, the context does mention the use of various datasets and machine learning methods for different studies.

For instance, in the study titled "Data classification based on machine learning methods. J. Big Data 7, 52," the authors used datasets related to data classification and machine learning methods. Similarly, in the study "Warming reduced flowering synchrony and extended community flowering season in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan plateau. Ecology 104," the authors used field data related to flowering synchrony and alpine meadows.

Moreover, the context mentions the use of various data sources such as USGS Earth Explorer (<https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/>) for supplementing the dataset, but it does not provide a link to the deep learning pipeline data repository.

Therefore, I regret to inform you that I could not find a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline in the provided context.
