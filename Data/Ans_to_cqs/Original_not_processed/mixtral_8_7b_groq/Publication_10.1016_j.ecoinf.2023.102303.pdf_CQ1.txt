Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about how the raw data for the FishInTurbidWater dataset was collected. However, it can be inferred that the dataset was collected in turbid waters, which suggests the use of underwater surveys or sensors.

In the context, it is mentioned that the dataset was collected and then weakly labeled. This implies that the raw data was collected first, and then the labeling process was carried out. The labeling process was done quickly and weakly, indicating that manual annotation by human experts may not have been used, or it was used to a limited extent.

Furthermore, the authors mention the application of deep learning methodologies to advance state-of-the-art underwater fish video processing techniques. This suggests that the raw data could be in the form of video recordings or image sequences.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on how the raw data was collected, it can be inferred that underwater surveys or sensors were used to collect video recordings or image sequences in turbid waters.
