Answer:::
The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including error rate, accuracy, training loss, and validation loss. The error rate is used to measure the number of incorrect predictions made by the model. In this case, the model achieved an error rate of 11.95% after training on 7362 labeled images. After fine-tuning the model, the error rate was reduced to 5.2%, indicating an improvement in the model's performance.

The accuracy of the model is the percentage of correct predictions made by the model. The fine-tuned model achieved an accuracy of 94.8%, indicating that it correctly classified 94.8% of the images.

The training loss and validation loss are used to measure the difference between the predicted and actual values. The training loss is the error rate of the model on the training dataset, while the validation loss is the error rate of the model on the validation dataset. The fine-tuned model achieved a training loss of 0.1397 and a validation loss of 0.1446, indicating a good fit of the model to the data.

However, the text does not explicitly mention the use of precision or recall as evaluation metrics. Precision is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives, while recall is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. These metrics are commonly used in binary classification tasks and can provide additional insights into the performance of the model.

In summary, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the error rate, accuracy, training loss, and validation loss metrics. However, the text does not explicitly mention the use of precision or recall as evaluation metrics.
