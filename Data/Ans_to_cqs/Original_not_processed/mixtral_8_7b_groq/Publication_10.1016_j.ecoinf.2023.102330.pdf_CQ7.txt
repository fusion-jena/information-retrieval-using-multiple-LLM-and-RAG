Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training can vary depending on the specific application and the goals of the model. However, there are some common practices for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets.

In general, the data is divided into three subsets: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and select the best model, and the test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model.

The training set is the largest of the three subsets and is used to train the model by presenting it with input data and corresponding labels. The model learns to map the input data to the correct labels by adjusting its internal parameters.

The validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters, which are the parameters that are not learned from the training data. Hyperparameters include, for example, the learning rate, the number of hidden layers, and the number of units in each layer. The validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data during the training process. This allows the user to monitor the model's performance and adjust the hyperparameters as needed to improve the model's performance.

The test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model. It is important to use a separate test set because the model may have learned to memorize the training data, which would not reflect its true performance on new, unseen data. The test set is used to evaluate the model's ability to generalize to new data.

In the context of the provided pieces of context, the data for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for acoustic detection of target species of interest may be split into training, validation, and test sets using these common practices. For example, in the study by Nolan et al. (2022), the authors trained a CNN for the automatic detection of Northern Bobwhite covey calls using a dataset of annotated audio recordings. The data was split into training, validation, and test sets, with the training set used to train the model, the validation set used to tune the model's hyperparameters, and the test set used to evaluate the model's performance.

In distance sampling studies, such as the one by Gill et al. (2014), the data may be split into training, validation, and test sets based on the spatial distribution of the data. For example, the data may be split based on the distance bins used in the study, such as 0-30m, >30-80m, >80-140m, >140-230m, and >230m. This would ensure that the model is trained and evaluated on data from different spatial scales.

Overall, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training depend on the specific application and the goals of the model. Common practices include using a training set to train the model, a validation set to tune the model's hyperparameters, and a test set to evaluate the model's final performance.
