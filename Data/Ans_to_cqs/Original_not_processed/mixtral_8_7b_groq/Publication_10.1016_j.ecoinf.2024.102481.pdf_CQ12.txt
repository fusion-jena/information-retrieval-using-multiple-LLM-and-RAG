Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly stated. The text focuses on the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques, specifically Random Forests (RF) analysis, to classify the maturity of Chilean hake.

Deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Transformers, are indeed types of ML models that fall under the broader category of artificial neural networks. However, the text does not mention or imply the use of any of these specific deep learning models in the described study.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
