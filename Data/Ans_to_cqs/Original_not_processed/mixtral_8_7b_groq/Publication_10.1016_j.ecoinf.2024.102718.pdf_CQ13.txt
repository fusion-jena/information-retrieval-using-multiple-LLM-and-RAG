Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific details about the learning rate or the optimizer used in the BEiT model. However, it does mention that sensitivity experiments were conducted to investigate the model's performance under various experimental setups, including modifications to the learning rate and other parameters like batch size, regularization intensity, and training epochs. Therefore, we can infer that the learning rate is one of the tunable hyperparameters in the BEiT model, but the specific value(s) used are not provided in the context.
