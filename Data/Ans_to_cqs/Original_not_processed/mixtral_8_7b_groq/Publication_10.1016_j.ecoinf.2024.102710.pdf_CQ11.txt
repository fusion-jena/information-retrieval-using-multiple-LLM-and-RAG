Answer:::
Unfortunately, there is no direct link to a data repository provided in the context regarding the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several links to different models, checkpoints, and TensorFlow Hub modules used in the pipeline, but it does not include a link to a repository that contains the complete pipeline or the data used. The models and checkpoints are from GitHub repositories belonging to different authors, and TensorFlow Hub modules are from Google's model library.

The context does mention that the deep learning pipeline was evaluated on focal and citizen-science datasets, but it does not provide a direct link to these datasets. It is possible that these datasets were collected from online resources such as Macaulay Library, but the specific datasets used are not identified.
