Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the mentioned studies. However, some of the studies do provide references to their data sources.

For instance, the study "BivalveNet: A hybrid deep neural network for common cockle (Cerastoderma edule) geographical traceability based on shell image analysis" mentions that the data used in their study is available at the ScienceDirect Ecological Informatics journal homepage.

Another study, "Assessing bivalve phylogeny using Deep Learning and Computer Vision Approaches" provides a link to the Open Science Framework (OSF) where the data and code for their study can be found.

The study "Machine Vision-Based Prediction of Lettuce Phytomorphological Descriptors using Deep Learning Networks" mentions that the data used in their study is available at the 2020 IEEE 12th International Conference on Humanoid, Nanotechnology, Information Technology, Communication and Control, Environment, and Management (HNICEM) data repository.

Therefore, while there is no direct link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline, some of the studies do provide links to their data sources. It is recommended to refer to the individual studies for more information on their data sources.
