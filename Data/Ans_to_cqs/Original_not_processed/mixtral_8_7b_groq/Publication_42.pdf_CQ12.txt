Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which includes references to CNN architectures, training and testing of CNN models, and hyperparameters specific to CNNs. For instance, the chosen model had an F1-score of 92.75%, and the architecture was chosen because it achieved average precision, recall, and an F1-score of 93%, indicating a suitable model classification. Furthermore, the models were ranked based on their F1 classification scores, and the top models were customized CNN architectures. Additionally, the performance of these customized CNN architectures was compared with selected state-of-the-art CNN optimized architectures, such as EfficientNetB0 and DenseNet121. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN.
