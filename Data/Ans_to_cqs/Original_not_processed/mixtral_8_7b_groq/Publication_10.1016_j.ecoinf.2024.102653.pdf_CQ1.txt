Answer:::

The context provided discusses a study that uses honey bee flight activity data in a deep learning model for toxicovigilance. However, it does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting the raw data. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot definitively answer what methods were utilized for collecting the raw data in this specific deep learning pipeline.

However, in general, there are various methods to collect raw data for deep learning models in different contexts. These methods can include:

1. Surveys: Researchers can use surveys to collect data from participants. Surveys can be conducted online or on paper and may include questions related to the topic of interest.

2. Sensors: Sensors can be used to collect data in real-time. For example, in the context of the study provided, honey bee flight activity data may have been collected using sensors that track the movement of honey bees.

3. Public datasets: Researchers can also use publicly available datasets to collect data. These datasets can be obtained from repositories such as UCI Machine Learning Repository, Kaggle, or Google Dataset Search.

4. Scraping data from websites: Researchers can use web scraping techniques to extract data from websites. This method can be useful when the data of interest is available on the web but not in a structured format.

5. Experiments: Researchers can conduct experiments to collect data. For example, in the context of the study provided, the researchers may have conducted experiments to collect data on honey bee flight activity.

Therefore, while the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline discussed in the context are not mentioned, there are various methods available for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines.
