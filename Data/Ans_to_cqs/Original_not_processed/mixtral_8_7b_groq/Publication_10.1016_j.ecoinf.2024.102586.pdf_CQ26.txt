The provided context discusses a study on the drivers of invasive alien species richness and abundance in a specific region, using the Random Forest (RF) model for data analysis. However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.

In general, data bias can be addressed during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline using various techniques, such as:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subsets while preserving the original proportion of classes. It ensures that each subset contains a representative sample of each class, reducing bias in the training and testing sets.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances in the minority class to balance the dataset. It can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances in the majority class to balance the dataset. It can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population. It can help prevent bias in the dataset and improve the model's performance.

These techniques can be used individually or in combination to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, the specific technique(s) used will depend on the dataset and the problem at hand. It is important to carefully evaluate the dataset and consider the potential sources of bias before selecting a technique.
