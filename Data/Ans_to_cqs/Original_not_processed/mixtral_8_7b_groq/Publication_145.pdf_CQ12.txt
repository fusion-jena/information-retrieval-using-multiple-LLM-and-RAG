Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is inferred from the context that the model was coded in the R programming language using the Keras interface, which supports various types of deep learning models including CNNs. Additionally, the model was trained using a GPU, which is particularly suitable for training CNNs due to their parallelizable nature. The specific architecture of the CNN used in the pipeline is not provided in the context.
