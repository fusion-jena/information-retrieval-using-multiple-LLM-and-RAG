Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling applied in the described deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the use of pre-trained models, fine-tuning, and different architectures (AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201) for leaf species classification. It also discusses the image pre-processing steps, including adaptive equalization of the Lightness in the IRGB color space. However, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques.

Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the amount and diversity of training data, thereby improving model generalization. These techniques create new training samples by applying transformations to the existing data. For instance, flipping horizontally or vertically can help the model learn symmetry, rotating can help with orientation invariance, and scaling can help the model learn to recognize objects at different sizes.

In summary, while the provided context discusses various aspects of the deep learning pipeline for leaf species classification, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.
