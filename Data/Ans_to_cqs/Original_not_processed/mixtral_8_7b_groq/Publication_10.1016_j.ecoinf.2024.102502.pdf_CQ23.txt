Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does mention some data processing techniques that could potentially contribute to the model's generalizability.

Firstly, in the "Data filtering" section, it is mentioned that environmental data is filtered to make it suitable for ecological processes. This could imply that the data is cleaned and preprocessed to remove any noise or outliers that might negatively impact the model's performance.

Secondly, in the "Data scaling" section, spatial and temporal scaling is applied to each metric of the time series. This involves the use of a parametrizable function, addTexture_3 Ã— 3_Mean, which includes neighborhood operations by applying spatial moving windows. This technique could help in capturing the spatial context of the data, which could improve the model's ability to generalize to new spatial locations.

However, the context does not mention any specific techniques used for ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query based on the given context.
