Based on the provided context, the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the Res_AUNet deep learning model for water sun glint detection in UAV water images are not explicitly mentioned. However, some implicit strategies can be inferred:

1. Diverse dataset: The model was trained and evaluated using the WSGD (Water Surface Glint Dataset), which presumably contains various water surface conditions, sun glint patterns, and potentially different UAV platforms and imaging settings. This diverse dataset could help the model learn a wide range of features and improve its generalizability.

2. Evaluation metrics: The use of five evaluation metrics, namely Accuracy (A), Precision (P), Recall (R), F1-score (F1), and Intersection over Union (IOU), suggests that the researchers aimed to assess the model's performance from multiple perspectives. This comprehensive evaluation might indirectly contribute to the model's generalizability.

3. Architectural improvements: The integration of the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into the encoding-decoding skip connections of the UNet network and the refinement of the convolutional blocks could potentially enhance the model's ability to capture distinctive semantic features associated with water sun glint. These architectural improvements might help the model better generalize to new, unseen data.

4. Overfitting mitigation: The incorporation of residual structures and the reduction of the number of convolutional kernels within each block were intended to mitigate overfitting. By preventing overfitting, the model is more likely to generalize well to new data.

Although not explicitly stated, these strategies may have contributed to the generalizability of the Res_AUNet deep learning model for water sun glint detection in UAV water images. However, without further information, it is not possible to confirm the use of specific techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting.
