Based on the provided context, there is not enough information to determine how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context includes various data sets and references related to environmental studies, but it does not contain information about the optimization of hyperparameters in a model.

Hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in machine learning model development, which involves selecting the best set of hyperparameters to minimize the model's generalization error. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.

Grid search involves creating a grid of hyperparameter values and training the model for each combination of hyperparameters. This method is exhaustive and can be computationally expensive.

Random search, on the other hand, involves randomly selecting hyperparameter values and training the model for each combination. Random search is less computationally expensive than grid search and can be more effective in finding the optimal hyperparameters.

Bayesian optimization is a more sophisticated method that involves using a probabilistic model to select the next set of hyperparameters to test based on the previous results.

Without further information, it is not possible to determine which method was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model in question.
