The provided context discusses various machine learning models and techniques, including artificial neural networks (ANNs) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), but it does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Answer:::
However, it is important to note that the context discusses the use of the XGBoost algorithm, which is a type of gradient boosting machine learning algorithm. While XGBoost is not a deep learning algorithm, it does employ regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. Specifically, XGBoost uses L1 and L2 regularization techniques on the weights of the trees in the model. L1 regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the weights, while L2 regularization adds a penalty equal to the square of the weights. These penalties help to reduce the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting.

Answer:::
As for deep learning pipelines, dropout is a commonly used regularization technique. Dropout involves randomly dropping out, or deactivating, a certain percentage of neurons in a layer during training. This helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons and promoting the learning of more robust features. L2 regularization is also commonly used in deep learning pipelines, where it is applied to the weights of the neurons in the model.

Answer:::
In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, it is likely that dropout and L2 regularization are used. Additionally, XGBoost, which is discussed in the context, employs L1 and L2 regularization techniques on the weights of the trees in the model.
