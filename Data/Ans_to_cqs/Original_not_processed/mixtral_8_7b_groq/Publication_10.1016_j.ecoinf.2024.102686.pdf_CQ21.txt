Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix after model training. However, it does mention that the clustering quality index (CQI) is used in the unsupervised clustering of SOM networks, which is a part of the model training process.

The CQI is used to determine the number of categories in the clustering results, which is a crucial step in the unsupervised clustering process. The context also mentions that the training efficiency of SVM for large sample datasets is not ideal and needs further optimization, but it does not specify any postprocessing steps for this optimization.

Additionally, the context mentions that the boundaries delineated by SVM may not be uniform with administrative boundaries, and the zoning results may face difficulties in real applications. To address this, the ability of remote connectivity will be an important driver of future regional differentiation, and quantifying this ability and incorporating it into HAâ€“NE coupled zoning will be a topic addressed in future studies. However, these steps are not specified as postprocessing steps but rather as future research directions.

Therefore, based on the provided context, there is no clear information on the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.
