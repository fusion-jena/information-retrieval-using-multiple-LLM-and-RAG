Answer:::
Unfortunately, the article does not provide a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The authors, Evan R. DeLancey, Craig Mahoney, Jahan Kariyeva, John F. Simms, Masoud Mahdianpari, and Brian Brisco, compared the performance of two machine learning approaches, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and XGBoost, for large-scale wetland classification in Alberta, Canada. However, they did not mention or share a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline or CNN model.

The article focuses on the comparison of deep learning and shallow learning techniques for wetland classification and does not offer implementation details or codebase access. The deep learning pipeline might have been built using popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch, but the specific implementation details are not provided in the article.

If you are interested in implementing a deep learning pipeline for a similar task, you can look into tutorials and examples available in the aforementioned deep learning libraries' documentation or other resources online.
