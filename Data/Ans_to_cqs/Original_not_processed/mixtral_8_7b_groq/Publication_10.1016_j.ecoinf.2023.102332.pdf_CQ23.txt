Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of a large and diverse corpus for training a word embedding model (GÃ¼nther et al., 2015), which can be a factor in ensuring the model's generalizability. The corpus used to train the model is a concatenation of the ukWaC corpus, Wikipedia, and the British National Corpus, which covers a broad variety of different topics and contains vectors for 300,000 different words.

Additionally, the BERT model (Devlin et al., 2018) which is a deep learning model, is pre-trained on a large corpus of text, specifically, BookCorpus (800M words) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words) which can help in the generalizability of the model.

In general, there are several measures that can be taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as:

* Using a diverse dataset: A dataset that contains a wide variety of examples and is representative of the problem space will help the model to generalize better.
* Cross-validation: This is a technique for evaluating the performance of a model by dividing the dataset into a number of subsets and training and testing the model on each subset. This helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data.
* Stratified splitting: When the data is split into training and testing sets, it is important to ensure that the distribution of classes is similar in both sets. Stratified sampling is a method to achieve this.

It is important to note that these measures are not mentioned in the provided context, so it is not possible to say for sure what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model in question.
