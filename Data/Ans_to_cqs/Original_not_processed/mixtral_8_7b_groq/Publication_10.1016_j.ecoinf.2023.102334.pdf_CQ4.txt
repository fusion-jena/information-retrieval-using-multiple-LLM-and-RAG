The provided context does not give specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model. However, data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to increase the amount of training data, improve model performance, and prevent overfitting. Some common data augmentation techniques for computer vision tasks include:

1. Flipping: This involves horizontally or vertically flipping the image. Horizontal flipping is a popular technique as it can help the model generalize better, especially for objects with left-right symmetry.
2. Rotation: The image is rotated by a certain angle. This can help the model learn invariance to image orientation.
3. Scaling: The image is resized by changing its width and height. This can help the model learn to recognize objects at different scales.
4. Translation: The image is shifted horizontally or vertically. This can help the model learn to recognize objects in different positions within the image.
5. Color jittering: This involves randomly changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue of the image. This can help the model learn color invariance and be more robust to different lighting conditions.
6. Cropping: A random portion of the image is cropped. This can help the model learn to focus on important parts of the image and be more robust to variations in the image background.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention which data augmentation techniques were used, it is mentioned that the ViT model was trained on two types of data. Data augmentation can be an effective way to make the most of limited training data, and it is likely that some of these techniques were used in the ViT model's training pipeline. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
