The provided context does not offer information on the specific deep learning model used in the pipeline.

The pieces of context mention various techniques and tools related to machine learning, digital soil mapping, visual programming, and data streaming. However, they do not specify the deep learning model applied in the pipeline.

Deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Transformers are widely used in different applications, including image processing, natural language processing, and time-series data analysis. Nonetheless, the context does not give any details about the deep learning model used in the pipeline.

In the context of digital soil mapping and machine learning for classification purposes, the paper "overview and comparison of machine-learning techniques for classification purposes in digital soil mapping" mentions various machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, Cubist, and Support Vector Machines. However, it does not mention any deep learning models.

In the context of node-based programming and visual programming, the text discusses the use of nodes for executing computing operations and creating programs. However, it does not mention any specific deep learning models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
