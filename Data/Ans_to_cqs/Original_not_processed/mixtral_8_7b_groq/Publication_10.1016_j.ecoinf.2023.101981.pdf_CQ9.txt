The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The sources mention the use of Kaleidoscope Pro software for detecting ungulate vocalizations and R programming language for statistical computing, but they do not specify where the data repository is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
