Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are no specific regularization methods mentioned that were used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipelines. However, it is common practice in deep learning to use techniques such as dropout, L2 regularization, or early stopping to prevent overfitting.

Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent over-reliance on any single neuron and encourages the network to learn more robust features. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that discourages large weight values, which can help to reduce overfitting by spreading the importance of features across multiple neurons. Early stopping is a method where training is halted as soon as the performance on a validation set stops improving, which can prevent the model from overfitting to the training data.

While the specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipelines described in the context are not mentioned, it is likely that one or more of these techniques were employed to prevent overfitting.
