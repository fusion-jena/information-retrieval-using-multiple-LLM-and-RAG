The provided context discusses Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and their application in big data analysis, specifically in the context of marine species identification. However, it does not directly mention techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

In general, data bias can be addressed during the preprocessing phase of a deep learning pipeline through various techniques, such as:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria, ensuring that each subset is representative of the overall population. This can help prevent bias in the training, validation, and testing datasets.
2. Oversampling: When a dataset is imbalanced, with one class having significantly more instances than another, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances in the minority class. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
3. Undersampling: Alternatively, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of instances in the majority class, achieving a balance between the classes. However, this technique may result in the loss of valuable information.
4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the target population can help minimize bias. This includes considering factors such as geographical location, demographics, and other relevant variables.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, it does highlight the importance of using appropriate methods for handling and analyzing big data. In the context of ELMs, the text states that ELMs can determine the appropriate output weights towards the most effective resolution of a problem, and they have the potential to generalize based on their training data set. This suggests that ELMs can potentially handle imbalanced datasets and prevent overfitting, which are common issues related to data bias.

In summary, the provided context does not directly discuss techniques for addressing data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, general techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be applied to mitigate data bias in deep learning pipelines, including those involving ELMs.
