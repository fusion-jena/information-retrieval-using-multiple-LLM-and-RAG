The provided pieces of context do not specify the type of deep learning model used in a particular pipeline for audio signal processing or ecological monitoring. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.

The context includes several studies related to audio signal processing, bird detection, and acoustic data analysis. However, none of these studies mention the use of any deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers.

In the context of Ross et al. (2021), the authors discuss the utility of acoustic indices for ecological monitoring in complex sonic environments. While they mention the potential for using these indices in machine learning and deep learning applications, they do not specify which deep learning models are used.

Similarly, in the context of Shaw et al. (n.d.), the authors discuss the importance of reducing device bias in acoustic data collection for consistent feature spaces across studies. While they mention the potential for using these consistent feature spaces in machine learning and deep learning applications, they do not specify which deep learning models are used.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
