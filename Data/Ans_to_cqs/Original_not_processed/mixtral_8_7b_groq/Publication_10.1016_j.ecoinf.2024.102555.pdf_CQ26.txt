Answer:::

The provided context does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of deep learning neural networks in flood susceptibility mapping and the verification of novel integrations of swarm intelligence algorithms into these networks.

In the context of deep learning, data bias can occur when the training data is not representative of the overall population, leading to poor model performance on new, unseen data. To address data bias, several techniques can be employed during the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline.

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the data into subgroups based on specific criteria, such as class labels, and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to ensure that the training, validation, and test sets are representative of the overall population.

2. Oversampling: When the minority class is underrepresented in the data, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from this class. This can be done by randomly duplicating instances from the minority class or by generating synthetic instances using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

3. Undersampling: Conversely, when the majority class is overrepresented in the data, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of instances from this class. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of instances from the majority class or by using techniques such as NearMiss to select instances based on their similarity to the minority class.

4. Diverse data collection: To ensure that the data is representative of the overall population, it is important to collect data from a variety of sources and to consider factors such as geographical location, time of day, and environmental conditions.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, they are commonly used in the preprocessing stage of deep learning pipelines to address data bias.
