Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to determine when the training of the system is complete. However, it does mention that the system's performance, usability, and reliability will be evaluated by a group of experts in spring 2020, which suggests that the training would likely be completed before this evaluation.

In the context of fire event and fire danger validation, there are specific thresholds mentioned for the Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC), a sub-index of the Fire Weather Index (FWI). These thresholds are used to categorize fire danger levels, but they do not directly relate to training completion criteria.

As for the human impact aspect, the FFMC is mentioned to have better prediction results for fire ignitions than the FWI in Austria. The availability of FFMC data from 2019 onwards is noted, but this does not provide information about training completion criteria either.

In general, training of systems like this could be completed when the validation loss plateaus or when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving significantly. However, without specific information provided in the context, this is just a general assumption.
