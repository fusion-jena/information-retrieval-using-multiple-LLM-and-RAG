Based on the provided context, there is no information about the training and deployment of a deep learning model. The text focuses on the use of TPINet, an information theory-based transfer entropy approach, to identify causal links between variables in a pine-dominated ecosystem.

The process described includes data collection and processing, with a minimum of 200 data points required for TPINet to effectively work. The study considered a maximum memory duration of variables up to 6 hours and computed the contributions of 6-hour variability to within-week variability for each week.

The context also mentions the use of surrogates and a significance level of 1% for network computation, as well as the consideration of lagged information from 1 to 12 hours.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide an answer to the query regarding the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model.
