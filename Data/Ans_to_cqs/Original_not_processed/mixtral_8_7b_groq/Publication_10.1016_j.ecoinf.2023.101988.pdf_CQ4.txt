I don't have enough information to directly answer the query about data augmentation techniques in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide a general overview of data augmentation techniques that are commonly used in deep learning, based on the general context of data analysis and machine learning provided.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of a training dataset by applying various transformations to the existing data. This can help improve the performance and generalization of deep learning models, particularly when training data is limited. Some common data augmentation techniques include:

1. Flipping: This involves flipping the image horizontally or vertically to create a new training example. This can help the model learn to recognize features that are invariant to orientation.
2. Rotation: This involves rotating the image by a certain angle to create a new training example. This can help the model learn to recognize features that are invariant to orientation and position.
3. Scaling: This involves scaling the image up or down to create a new training example. This can help the model learn to recognize features at different scales.
4. Translation: This involves shifting the image horizontally or vertically to create a new training example. This can help the model learn to recognize features that are invariant to position.
5. Color jittering: This involves randomly changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue of the image to create a new training example. This can help the model learn to recognize features that are invariant to color.
6. Cropping: This involves randomly cropping a portion of the image to create a new training example. This can help the model learn to recognize features that are important regardless of the context.

Based on the provided context, it is possible that some of these data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, without more specific information about the pipeline, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
