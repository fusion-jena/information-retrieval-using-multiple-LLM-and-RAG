Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of a deep learning model. However, I can provide some insights into the modeling approaches mentioned in the text.

The text discusses the use of modeling for predicting species distributions based on environmental variables. The primary goal of this modeling is to create accurate models that can be used as indicators of change over time. The authors emphasize the importance of capturing ecological amplitude for species distribution rather than focusing solely on sample size.

The modeling process includes selecting a classifier or probability of occurrence estimator from hundreds of options, with general linear models, MaxEnt, and random forests being among the most commonly applied. The selected classifier can be fine-tuned using modeling package options that enable automated tuning for parameters through resampling and standard default values.

The text also mentions the use of multiple methods to detect overlapping outcomes, allowing for some strength of evidence within a study. However, the authors note that using multiple methods may be too burdensome when generating hundreds or thousands of models due to numerous species, predictor variable combinations, and time intervals.

Regarding deep learning models, they are typically used for tasks such as classification, segmentation, and object detection. However, based on the provided context, it is unclear whether a deep learning model was used or intended to be used in this specific case.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query regarding the purpose of a deep learning model, it does provide insights into the modeling approaches used for predicting species distributions based on environmental variables.
