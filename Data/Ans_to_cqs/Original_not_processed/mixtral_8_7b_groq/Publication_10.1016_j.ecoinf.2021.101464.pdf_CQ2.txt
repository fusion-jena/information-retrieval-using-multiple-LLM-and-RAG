The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that big data theory and technology, neural networks, and structural equations are applied to understand the influence of forest microclimate on NAI (Net Assimilation Rate). Given that neural networks are a type of deep learning method, it can be inferred that the data used in this study is likely to be in a format that can be processed by these deep learning algorithms.

In general, deep learning models can handle various data formats such as images, audio, video, and structured data (e.g., CSV files). For instance, in computer vision tasks, images are often used as input data, while in natural language processing, text data is typically represented as sequences of words or tokens. In the context of the study, the relevant variables include PM2.5, RH, Ts, Ms, AP, WS, Dr, UV, and PAR, which are most likely represented as numerical values in a structured format like a CSV file.

Moreover, the study mentions the use of sensors for measuring temperature, humidity, wind speed, atmospheric pressure, photosynthetically active radiation, direct radiation, ultraviolet radiation, and net radiation. These sensors would generate time-series data, which can be stored in a structured format like CSV files.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that the data is likely to be in a format that can be processed by deep learning algorithms, such as numerical values in a structured format like CSV files. The data might have been obtained from sensors, resulting in time-series data.
