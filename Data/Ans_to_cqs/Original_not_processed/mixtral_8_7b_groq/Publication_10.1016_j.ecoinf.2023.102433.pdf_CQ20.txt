The given context discusses two different services related to data processing and analysis, Google Earth Engine (GEE) and NASA Web Service API Provider. However, the context does not provide information on the specific hardware resources used for training deep learning models in GEE.

Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provided by Google, which includes services such as available datasets, allocated resources, implemented algorithms, and export data formats. Deep learning analysis can be performed in GEE using Tensorflow, an open-source framework developed by Google. However, the context does not specify the hardware resources used for training deep learning models in GEE.

On the other hand, the context provides information about the NASA Web Service API Provider, which is a library that allows users to query the NASA service to discover all products available for a given reference date. The library provides methods to execute requests for multiple products, dates, and locations, and it returns a lazy iterator to improve memory management for data ingestion operations.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the hardware resources used for training deep learning models in GEE.
