Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers in the pipeline. Instead, it discusses various regression and machine learning approaches used for species distribution modeling (SDM) in the ibis.iSDM package.

The seven different engines supported by ibis.iSDM can be classified into engines using either regression or non-parametric machine learning approaches, and being frequentist or Bayesian in nature. These engines include regularized elastic net regressions, Bayesian regularized "Spike-and-Slab" regressions, Bayesian additive regression trees, monotonic gradient descent boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting.

While these methods can be considered machine learning techniques, they are not deep learning models. Deep learning models typically involve multiple hidden layers and complex architectures, allowing them to learn and extract features from large and high-dimensional datasets.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it appears that the pipeline does not use any deep learning models such as CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers.
