The provided context does not contain information about the datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context focuses on the use of different methods and datasets in the study of above-ground biomass (AGB) prediction, primarily in the field of remote sensing and machine learning.

In the context, the authors use SRTM DEM data, spectral bands, and vegetation-derived indices to predict AGB. Specifically, they used the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) along with other variable sets to improve the prediction of AGB. The study also mentions the use of the EarthExplorer platform to supplement their dataset. However, these datasets are not directly related to deep learning pipelines like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet are standard datasets used for training and evaluating deep learning models in various computer vision tasks. MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits, CIFAR contains images from 10 different classes, and ImageNet is a large-scale dataset of images with thousands of classes. These datasets are widely used in the deep learning community for benchmarking and comparing the performance of different models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot provide an answer related to the datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines.
