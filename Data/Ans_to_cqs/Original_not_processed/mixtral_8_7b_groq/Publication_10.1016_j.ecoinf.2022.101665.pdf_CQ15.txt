The provided context does not give information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the evaluation of thematic maps produced by a calibrated statistical prediction method, specifically addressing the testing phase of assessing the accuracy of the final model. It discusses the use of resampling methods when data availability is limited and mentions the use of machine learning techniques like random forest models for predicting above-ground biomass (AGB) in central Africa. However, it does not provide information about the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
