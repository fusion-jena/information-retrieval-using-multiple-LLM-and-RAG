Answer:

The provided context does not give information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the description of the methodology for estimating Aboveground Biomass (AGB) using LightGBM, a gradient booster tree-based learning algorithm proposed by Microsoft, and XGBoost. It explains the data collection, image processing, and hyperparameter optimization using Bayesian optimizers and TDO. However, it does not mention any cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform for model deployment.
