After reviewing the provided references, I was unable to locate information regarding the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The references mainly focus on different methods and techniques for detecting and classifying man-made objects in various environments using machine learning and deep learning approaches.

For instance, Abu and Diamant (2022) propose a contour-based features analysis method for detecting underwater man-made objects, while Han et al. (2022) propose a deep learning technique for detecting and classifying vessels and oil platforms in remote optical imagery. Similarly, Çalıs¸kan (2023) discusses detecting human activity types from 3D posture data using deep learning models.

However, none of the references mention any data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that the data repository is not publicly available or was not specified in the references provided.

Therefore, I regret to inform you that I could not find the information you were looking for.
