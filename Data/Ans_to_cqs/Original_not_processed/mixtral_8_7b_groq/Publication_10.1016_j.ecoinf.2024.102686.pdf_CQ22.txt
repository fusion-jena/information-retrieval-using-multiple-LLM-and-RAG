Based on the provided context, the query asks for the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, the context does not give information about a specific deep learning model or its performance evaluation metrics. Instead, it describes a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) network used for spatial clustering of the AEGC (Aerospace Global Change) and the use of a Clustering Quality Index (CQI) to determine the optimal number of categories for clustering.

Therefore, we cannot provide the requested information about the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. Instead, we can only answer based on the provided context that the Clustering Quality Index (CQI) is used to evaluate the performance of the SOM network in clustering the AEGC data. The CQI is calculated for different numbers of clustering categories, and the number of categories with the smallest CQI value is selected as the optimal number of categories for clustering.
