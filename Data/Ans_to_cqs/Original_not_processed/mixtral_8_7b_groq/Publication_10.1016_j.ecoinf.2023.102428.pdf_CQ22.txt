The text provided does not directly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does describe the accuracy assessment of a land use and land cover (LULC) classification, which can provide some insight.

In the context of LULC classification, the following metrics are used to evaluate the performance:

1. Producer's Accuracy (PA): This measures the proportion of actual cases in a category that are correctly identified. It is a measure of omission error.
2. User's Accuracy (UA): This measures the proportion of cases that are identified as belonging to a certain category that are actually so. It is a measure of commission error.
3. Overall Accuracy: This is the percentage of correctly classified pixels out of the total number of pixels.
4. Overall Kappa Statistics: This is a statistical measure that considers the agreement between the classified and actual categories. It takes into account the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance.

In the context of deep learning models, the most common metrics used for evaluation are:

1. Accuracy: This is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples.
2. Precision: This is the ratio of correct positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
3. Recall: This is the ratio of correct positive predictions to the total actual positives.
4. F1 Score: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

In the table provided (Table 7), the 'Accuracy Rate' is given as 88.79%. However, without more information, it's unclear whether this is a measure of overall accuracy, or if it's a different metric altogether. Therefore, while we can infer some metrics used for evaluation from the provided context, we cannot definitively answer the query without more information.
