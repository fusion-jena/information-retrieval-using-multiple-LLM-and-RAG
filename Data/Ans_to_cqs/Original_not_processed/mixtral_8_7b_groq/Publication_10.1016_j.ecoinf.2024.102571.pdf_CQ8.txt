Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about a code repository for a deep learning pipeline being available on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The context consists of academic papers and a report, which primarily focus on environmental topics such as water pollution control, greenhouse gas emissions, and nitrogen and phosphorus levels in urban wastewater. While some of these papers involve the use of computational models and algorithms, none of them mention or provide a code repository for a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
