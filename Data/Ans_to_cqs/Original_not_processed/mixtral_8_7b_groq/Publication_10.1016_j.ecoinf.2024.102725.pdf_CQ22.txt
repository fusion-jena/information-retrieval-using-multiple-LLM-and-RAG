The text provided discusses the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of NDVI image reconstruction, rather than a specific deep learning model. However, it does mention four metrics that are used to evaluate the disparities between predicted and actual images, which are the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and error relative global accuracy (ERGAS).

The coefficient of determination (R2) reflects the goodness-of-fit of the predicted images to the reference images. It ranges from negative infinity to 1, where a value of 1 indicates perfect alignment between the predicted and true values, while R2 = 0 indicates that all of the predicted values are equal to the mean of the true values. Values below zero indicate no correlation.

The root mean squared error (RMSE) is used to evaluate the discrepancy between the fused results and observed values. It is calculated as the square root of the average of the squared differences between the fused results and observed values and is particularly sensitive to the impact of outliers. A higher value indicates a larger deviation, whereas a lower value indicates a better match with observed values.

Mean absolute error (MAE) is another metric used to evaluate the difference between predicted and actual images. It is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and observed values.

Error relative global accuracy (ERGAS) is a metric used to evaluate the spatial distortion of the predicted images compared to the reference images. It is calculated based on the ratio of the pixel sizes between images and the mean value of the corresponding band.

Therefore, while the text does not explicitly mention accuracy, precision, or recall as evaluation metrics, it does discuss several metrics that are commonly used to evaluate the performance of models, including R2, RMSE, MAE, and ERGAS.
