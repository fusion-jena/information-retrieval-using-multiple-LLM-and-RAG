The provided context does not contain specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for predicting wetland biodiversity trends in the Massaciuccoli Lake basin. However, it does mention the use of big-data mining approaches based on Artificial Intelligence models.

In general, optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to optimize the model parameters. SGD is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. Adam, on the other hand, is an adaptive optimization algorithm that adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the estimated first and second moments of the gradient.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam were used in the deep learning pipeline for predicting wetland biodiversity trends in the Massaciuccoli Lake basin. However, without explicit information in the provided context, this answer is based on general knowledge of deep learning pipelines and may not reflect the specific techniques used in this study.
