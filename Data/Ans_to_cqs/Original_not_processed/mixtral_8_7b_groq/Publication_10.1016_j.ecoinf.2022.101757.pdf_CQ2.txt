Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data formats. This is evident in the studies referenced, which utilize image datasets for tasks such as semantic segmentation and geo-localization.

For instance, in the study by Aghanaki, T. (Taghanaki et al., 2021), artificial and natural objects were located and delineated in photos. Similarly, L. Martinez-Sanchez et al. employed images for semantic segmentation. The LUCAS images used in these studies are likely in a standard image format such as JPEG or PNG.

Moreover, the study by Tang, J., Gong, C., Guo, F., Yang, Z., Wu, Z., 2022a uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for geo-localization based on image data. CNNs are a type of deep learning model commonly used for image analysis tasks.

However, while image data formats are predominantly used in the provided context, it is important to note that deep learning models can also work with other data formats such as audio, video, and CSV. The choice of data format depends on the specific task and the type of information being analyzed. For example, time series data might be stored in a CSV file, while speech data might be stored in an audio format like WAV. Ultimately, the deep learning pipeline can accommodate a variety of data formats, but the context provided primarily pertains to image data.
