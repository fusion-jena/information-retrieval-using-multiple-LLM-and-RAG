Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention the use of BirdNET, a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring, and the creation of the "Agmon annotated dataset" to evaluate its performance. It is likely that the developers used standard techniques to monitor model performance, such as tracking training and validation loss and accuracy throughout the training process. Additionally, they may have used metrics specific to their task, such as recall and precision for species identification. The low recall and precision rates mentioned in the context suggest that the model's performance was closely monitored, and efforts were made to improve its ability to identify species correctly.

Moreover, the CRediT authorship contribution statement mentions the involvement of the authors in the investigation, formal analysis, and data curation, which could imply that they were closely involved in the monitoring of the model's performance during training. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.

In summary, while the provided context does not give explicit details about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, it suggests that standard techniques were used, and the authors closely monitored the model's performance, making efforts to improve its ability to identify species correctly.
