Answer:::

The provided context does not include information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other method for hyperparameter tuning. The text focuses on the performance of the model with and without post-processing using two decision rules (r1 and r2). It also compares the performance of the model to humans in identifying different fish species. However, the specifics of the model's hyperparameters and the optimization process are not discussed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
