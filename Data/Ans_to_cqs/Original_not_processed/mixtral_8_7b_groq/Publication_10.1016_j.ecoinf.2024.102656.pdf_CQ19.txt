The provided pieces of context do not contain information about the use of deep learning models, nor do they mention the use of specific frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context discusses various studies related to habitat suitability and conservation for different species, using statistical and machine learning methods like GLM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, and MARS. However, these are not deep learning models, and the studies do not mention the use of TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other deep learning frameworks. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model.
