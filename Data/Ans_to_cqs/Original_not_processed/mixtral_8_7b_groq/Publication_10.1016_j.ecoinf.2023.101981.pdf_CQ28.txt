The provided context does not contain information about the use of a deep learning model, let alone the platform it was deployed on. The context focuses on the use of acoustic recorders to collect data on undulated Tinamou (Crypturellus undulatus) in the Brazilian Pantanal, as well as other studies related to acoustic monitoring and statistical computing. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
