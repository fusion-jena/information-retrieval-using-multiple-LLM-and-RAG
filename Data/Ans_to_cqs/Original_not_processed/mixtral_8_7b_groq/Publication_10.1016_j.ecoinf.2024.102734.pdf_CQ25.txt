Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the context is classification. Specifically, they are used to classify bioacoustic data, such as possum vocalizations and noise sources.

The first model mentioned is ResNet-50, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture developed by He et al. (2016). ResNet-50 is a widely used model in computer vision tasks and has been adapted for the classification of audio spectrograms in the bioacoustic application described in the context.

The second model mentioned is the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), which was developed by Gong et al. (2021). The AST model is a transformer-based architecture designed specifically for audio signal processing tasks, including audio classification.

The third model mentioned is HuBERT, which was developed by Hsu et al. (2021). HuBERT is a self-supervised learning approach for speech representation that utilizes large-scale unlabelled data. It has been applied to bioacoustic data classification in the context provided.

These models are trained on a dataset containing 3000 5-second segments of bioacoustic data, including 1130 possum vocalizations and 1870 noise sources. The dataset is split into 80% training and 20% validation sets for evaluating model performance during training. Additionally, a separate test set containing 500 segments is used to evaluate the final model performance.

In summary, the deep learning models ResNet-50, AST, and HuBERT are used for classification tasks in the field of computational bioacoustics, specifically for classifying bioacoustic data such as possum vocalizations and noise sources.
