Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the use of deep learning models or specific frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text focuses on the application of Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) and Generalized Additive Models (GAM) to analyze the variability of herring growth. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query regarding deep learning frameworks.
