Answer:::
The deep learning model used in the study described in the provided context utilized the NASnet architecture with a Faster-rcnn backbone, implemented in Tensorflow2. The parameters of the model can be found on TensorFlow model zoo under the name “faster\_rcnn\_nas”.

For each K-fold, the model was trained on its own version of Trainingclips through 200,000 iterations, using a batch size of 16 images per iteration. The training was conducted using a learning rate of 0.008 with a cosine learning rate decay.

The specific type of optimizer used in the model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the optimizer used is compatible with the use of a learning rate and cosine learning rate decay. Common optimizers that support learning rate decay include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.

It is also worth noting that all images used in the study were resized to 1333 × 800 pixels to match with the pre-training data (COCO dataset) used to prepare the first layers of the model, in order to save computing time during the training phase.

In summary, the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include:

* Learning rate: 0.008
* Cosine learning rate decay
* Batch size: 16 images per iteration
* Number of iterations: 200,000
* Image size: 1333 × 800 pixels
* Optimizer: not explicitly mentioned, but likely compatible with learning rate decay (e.g. SGD, Adam, RMSprop)
