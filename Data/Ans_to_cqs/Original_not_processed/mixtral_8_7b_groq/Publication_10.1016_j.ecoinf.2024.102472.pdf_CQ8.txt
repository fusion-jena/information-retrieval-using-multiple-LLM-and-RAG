Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the methodology, materials, and results of the research, but it does not mention where the code is hosted. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket link to the code repository. If you are interested in the code, I would recommend contacting the authors of the study directly for more information.
