Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline of DEPP (Data-Driven Phylogenetic Placement) are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that the batch size is fixed to 32 and the training loss is checked every 50 epochs. If the value of the loss function fails to decrease in two consecutive checks, the training is stopped. This could be considered as a form of early stopping, which is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting. Additionally, the model with the optimal objective function value is chosen, which implies that there might be some form of model selection or regularization to prevent overfitting. But, the context does not provide specific information on dropout or L2 regularization which are commonly used regularization techniques in deep learning.

In summary, while the context provides information about the DEPP deep learning pipeline, it does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization as regularization methods to prevent overfitting. However, it does mention the use of early stopping and model selection as possible regularization techniques.
