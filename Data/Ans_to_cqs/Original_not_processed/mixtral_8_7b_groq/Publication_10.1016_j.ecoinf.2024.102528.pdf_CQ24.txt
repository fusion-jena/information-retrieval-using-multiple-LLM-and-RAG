Answer:::

The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of deep learning models in several studies, particularly in the context of image and audio processing for bird-related research.

In general, deep learning models often employ various strategies to manage randomness during training, such as:

1. Fixed random seed value: To ensure reproducibility, deep learning models can be initialized with a fixed random seed value. This ensures that the random initialization of weights and biases, as well as the order of data processing, remains consistent across multiple runs.
2. Data shuffling and augmentation: Randomly shuffling the training dataset and applying data augmentation techniques can help improve model performance and reduce overfitting. Data shuffling ensures that the model does not learn patterns from a specific order in the dataset, while data augmentation generates new synthetic data points by applying random transformations to the existing dataset.
3. Dropout regularization: This technique randomly drops out a proportion of neurons during training, which helps prevent overfitting and encourages the model to learn more robust features.
4. Batch normalization: This method normalizes the inputs of each layer, reducing the internal covariate shift caused by the randomness of the previous layer's outputs.
5. Learning rate schedules: Adaptive learning rate schedules, such as step decay or exponential decay, can help manage the randomness of the learning process by systematically adjusting the learning rate during training.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these strategies, it is reasonable to assume that they were employed during the development of the deep learning models used in the studies.
