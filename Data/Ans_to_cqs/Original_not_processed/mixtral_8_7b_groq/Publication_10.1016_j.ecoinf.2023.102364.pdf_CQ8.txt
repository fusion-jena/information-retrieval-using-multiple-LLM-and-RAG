Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text mentions the use of an ensemble of machine learning models, including RandomForest, Treenet, CART, and MARS, but it does not specify where the code for this pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
