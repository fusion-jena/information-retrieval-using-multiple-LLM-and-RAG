Answer:

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training in the context provided involves the use of a validation set or procedure. Although not explicitly mentioned, the description of the training process implies the use of a validation set to assess the model's performance and adjust the parameters accordingly.

During the training of deep learning (DL) models, annotated data is used to adjust the parameters of the model through an optimization process. Once the training process is complete, the model is evaluated using an independent testing data set to estimate its performance on unseen data. The distinction between the training and testing data sets suggests the use of a validation set to monitor the model's performance during training.

A validation set is a subset of the training data set that is held out and not used in the parameter adjustment process. Instead, the model's performance is evaluated on the validation set after each epoch (iteration through the entire training dataset) or at regular intervals during training. This process provides an estimate of how well the model is generalizing to new data, which is crucial for avoiding overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and performs poorly on new, unseen data.

Monitoring the model performance during training using a validation set allows for early stopping, a common technique used to prevent overfitting. If the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade, even if the performance on the training set continues to improve, the training process is stopped early, preventing the model from learning the training data's noise and outliers.

In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a validation set to evaluate the model's performance after each epoch or at regular intervals during training. This process helps prevent overfitting and ensures that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.
