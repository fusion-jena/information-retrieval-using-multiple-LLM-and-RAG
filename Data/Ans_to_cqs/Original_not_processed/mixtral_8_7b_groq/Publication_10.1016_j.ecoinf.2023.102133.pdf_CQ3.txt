Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the study of evapotranspiration (ETa) and irrigation. The text focuses on the description of the dataset used for the study, the methods for estimating ETa, and the evaluation of the machine learning models for predicting ETa.

The dataset includes weather and micro-meteorological data recorded by a weather station and an EC tower, respectively, from 2018 to 2021. The data were processed and filtered to ensure their quality and suitability for the analysis. However, there is no mention of any data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, or semantic segmentation, which are commonly used in computer vision and image processing tasks in deep learning.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this study.
