Based on the provided context, there is no information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context mainly discusses the use of Random Forest (RF) for image classification, not deep learning.

In the RF classification process, the input features and classes are first defined. Then, the RF calculates several random decision trees based on the number of training samples and the number of trees. The more trees there are, the more accurate the model is, but the longer the calculation time is. RF creates decision trees randomly using the Gini coefficient to split them. A model based on the decision trees is thus created and used to classify all the pixels. A pixel is classified according to the majority vote of the decision trees.

In this process, the data is not split into training, testing, and validation sets. Instead, the entire dataset is used to train the RF model. The quality of the model is evaluated based on the accuracy of the classification of the pixels.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
