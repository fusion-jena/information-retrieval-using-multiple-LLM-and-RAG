Answer: The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics are presented in Table 6 for five different networks, including VGG16, Inceptionv3, ResNet34, ResNet50, and ResNet101. The bold values in the table represent the highest performance achieved by each network.

Accuracy is a ratio of correctly predicted samples to the total number of samples. Precision, on the other hand, measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positives. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which provides a balanced assessment of both measures.

In the study, ResNet50 surpassed the other models in terms of all evaluation metrics, with an accuracy of 0.81, precision of 0.82, recall of 0.81, and F1-score of 0.81 for the testing set. These metrics demonstrate the model's ability to classify landscape types accurately, which is a challenging task due to the subjectivity and information overlap involved in manual sample distinction.

Furthermore, Fig. 4 displays the F1-scores of the five categories across all networks, with ResNet50 having the best values for four categories, except for the RRP. Therefore, ResNet50 was selected for the case validation, and its classification results corresponded to the actual situation.

In summary, the study used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. These metrics helped assess the model's ability to classify landscape types accurately, with ResNet50 achieving the highest performance.
