Answer:

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a validation set, which consists of 7554 images. This set is separate from the training set, which contains 22,666 images, and the testing set, which contains another 7554 images. The model's performance is evaluated on the validation set after each epoch of training. This allows for the tracking of the model's progress and the detection of any overfitting to the training data. The accuracy of the model on both the training and validation sets is reported in Figure 7 and Figure 8. These figures show the training and validation accuracy of the model as it is trained over time. By monitoring the model's performance on the validation set, the researchers can ensure that the model is learning effectively and make adjustments to the training process as needed. Additionally, the use of data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, zoom, shearing, shifting, brightness changes, and horizontal and vertical flips, as depicted in Figure 6, helps to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
