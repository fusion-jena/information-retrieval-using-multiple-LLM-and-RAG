Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning models for sound data, such as learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention that tuning of network hyperparameters and convolutional filters provides automated feature learning in CNN architectures for sound data.

In general, hyperparameters in deep learning models can include learning rate, batch size, number of layers, number of neurons, optimizer, activation function, regularization techniques, and more. These hyperparameters are typically chosen based on the specific problem and dataset at hand.

In the context of sound data, learning rate and optimizer are important hyperparameters to consider. The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. The optimizer is the algorithm used to update the weights in the network based on the gradient of the loss function. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.

Additionally, the context mentions that one approach to represent sound data in CNN architectures is to use 2D image spectrograms. In this case, hyperparameters such as filter size, stride, and padding may be important to consider.

Overall, while the provided context does not give specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models for sound data, it does provide insight into the general process of hyperparameter tuning and the types of hyperparameters that may be important to consider for sound data represented as amplitude-time waveforms or 2D image spectrograms.
