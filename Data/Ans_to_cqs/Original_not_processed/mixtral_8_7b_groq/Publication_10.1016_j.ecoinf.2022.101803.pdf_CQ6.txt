The provided context discusses the use of a nested k-fold cross-validation scheme in XGBoost, but it does not mention any specific preprocessing steps for deep learning models such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.

However, I can provide some general information about common preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

Normalization and scaling are important preprocessing steps for many deep learning models, especially for neural networks that use gradient-based optimization algorithms. These algorithms are sensitive to the scale of the input features, and large differences in scales can cause some features to dominate the optimization process, leading to poor performance. Normalization and scaling can help address this issue by transforming the input features to have similar scales.

Normalization typically involves transforming the input features to have zero mean and unit variance, while scaling involves transforming the features to a common range, such as [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. There are various normalization and scaling techniques, including z-score normalization, min-max scaling, and robust scaling.

Cleaning is another important preprocessing step for deep learning models. This involves removing or correcting any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values in the input data. There are various data cleaning techniques, including imputation, outlier detection, and feature selection.

Imputation involves replacing missing values with estimated values based on the other data points. There are various imputation techniques, including mean imputation, median imputation, and regression imputation.

Outlier detection involves identifying and removing or correcting any data points that are significantly different from the other data points. There are various outlier detection techniques, including statistical methods, distance-based methods, and density-based methods.

Feature selection involves selecting a subset of the input features that are most relevant for the prediction task. This can help reduce the dimensionality of the input data, improve the generalization performance of the model, and reduce the computational cost of training and inference. There are various feature selection techniques, including filter methods, wrapper methods, and embedded methods.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention any specific preprocessing steps for deep learning models, normalization, scaling, and cleaning are important preprocessing steps for many deep learning models. Normalization and scaling can help address the sensitivity of gradient-based optimization algorithms to the scale of the input features, while cleaning can help remove or correct any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values in the input data.
