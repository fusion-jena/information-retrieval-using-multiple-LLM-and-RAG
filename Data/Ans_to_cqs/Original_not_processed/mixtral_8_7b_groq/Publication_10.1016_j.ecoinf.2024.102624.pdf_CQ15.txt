Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of various classifiers, such as RF, SVM, and MARS, in ecological informatics for land cover classification. It mentions the use of grid search for hyperparameter tuning and data augmentation to enhance the generalization capabilities of the models. However, it does not specify any optimization techniques used in a deep learning context, like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
