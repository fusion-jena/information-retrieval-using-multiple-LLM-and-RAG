Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of Transformer-based architectures and Convolutional LSTM networks for various tasks, but it does not mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. 

Data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to increase the amount of training data and improve model performance by applying various transformations to the existing data. These transformations can include horizontal flipping, vertical flipping, rotating, scaling, and more. 

However, the context provided here focuses on the description of the data used and the models implemented, without going into detail about the data augmentation techniques applied. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
