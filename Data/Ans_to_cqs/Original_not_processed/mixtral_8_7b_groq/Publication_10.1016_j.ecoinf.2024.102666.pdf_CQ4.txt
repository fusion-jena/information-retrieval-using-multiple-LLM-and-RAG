Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the use of satellite images, artificial neural networks (ANN), and atmospheric correction for aquatic environments. However, it does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.
