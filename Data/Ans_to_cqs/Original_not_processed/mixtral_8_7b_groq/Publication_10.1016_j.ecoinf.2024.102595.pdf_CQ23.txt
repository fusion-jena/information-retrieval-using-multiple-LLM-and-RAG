Answer:::

The generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through a combination of measures, including data set allocation, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.

Firstly, the preprocessed data was divided into three sets: training (80%), validation (10%), and test sets (10%). This 80-10-10 split, as opposed to other possible splits like 70-30, provided a more extensive training set. This larger training set increased the likelihood of developing a better-generalized model. The test set, which the model had not previously seen during the training or validation phases, indicated the model's performance in real-world scenarios (Shah et al., 2018).

Secondly, cross-validation was employed to assess each candidate combination of hyperparameters. Specifically, tenfold cross-validation was used, providing a reliable estimate of the model's performance. This method balances the trade-off between bias and variance and guards against overfitting (Shahhosseini et al., 2021).

Lastly, hyperparameter tuning was carried out systematically across a predefined grid of hyperparameter values. A unique parameter grid was defined for each model considered, targeting specific model characteristics such as the number of estimators in ensemble methods or the depth of trees in decision tree-based algorithms. This process ensured that the eventual choice of hyperparameters was not arbitrary but was backed by empirical evidence (Schratz et al., 2019).

Therefore, the generalizability of the deep learning model was addressed through a comprehensive approach involving data set allocation, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.
