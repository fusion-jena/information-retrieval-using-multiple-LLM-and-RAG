Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the models were trained and evaluated on a dataset, and it includes information about how the dataset was preprocessed and how the class imbalance was handled.

Inception-V3 model accepts images resized to (299, 299) pixels but ViT and ResNet resize to (224, 224) pixels, which suggests that the dataset includes images of various sizes. Additionally, it is mentioned that dataset imbalance was dealt with by including class weights in the cross-entropy loss function, indicating that the dataset is imbalanced and contains multiple classes.

It is also mentioned that for few-shot learning, CLIP model was trained on 400 million images from the web along with their captions.

So, it can be inferred that the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is not one of the standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet, but a custom dataset of images with their captions.
