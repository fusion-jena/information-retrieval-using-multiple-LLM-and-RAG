The provided context discusses the optimization of CART (Classification and Regression Tree) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) models in the context of bathymetry prediction, but it does not mention any deep learning pipeline or optimization techniques such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide an answer to the query about optimization techniques in the deep learning pipeline.
