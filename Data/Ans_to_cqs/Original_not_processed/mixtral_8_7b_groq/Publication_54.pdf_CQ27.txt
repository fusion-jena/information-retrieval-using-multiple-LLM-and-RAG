The text provided does not give a detailed explanation of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does provide some context regarding the training process of the model.

The Inception-ResNet-v2 model was trained using the mini-batch gradient descent algorithm with a batch size of 32 and a learning rate of 0.0001. The model was trained on a dataset of 3,132 images of endemic bird species, which were split into 2,5056 images for training and 626 images for validation. The training dataset was augmented 10 times, resulting in a total of 31,320 images.

After training the model on the source domain (the 27 endemic bird species), the learned features were transferred to a second target network to train the newly added dataset on endemic bird species (target domain). This process is called transfer learning and it helps improve the learning of the target predictive function in the target domain using the knowledge acquired from the source domain.

As for the deployment of the model, the text does not provide specific details. However, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized and saved in a format that can be loaded and used for making predictions on new data. The platform for deployment would depend on the specific requirements of the application, such as whether it needs to be deployed on a server, embedded in a mobile application, or integrated with a web application.

In summary, while the text provides some context regarding the training of the deep learning model, it does not give a detailed explanation of the deployment process. It can be inferred that the model was likely serialized and saved in a format for later use, and the platform for deployment would depend on the specific requirements of the application.
