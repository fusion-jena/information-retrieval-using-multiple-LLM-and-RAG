Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch being used to build a deep learning model. In fact, the context suggests that deep learning algorithms were considered for developing water quality prediction models, but due to the limited number of samples, they were not ultimately used. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide information on the specific deep learning frameworks that were used.
