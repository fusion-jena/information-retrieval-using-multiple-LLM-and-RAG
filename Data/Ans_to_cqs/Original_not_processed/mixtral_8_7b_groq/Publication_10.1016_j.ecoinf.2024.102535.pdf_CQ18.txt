Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of a cost function minimized using the Adam optimizer. The Adam optimizer is a type of optimization algorithm used in machine learning to update the parameters of a model based on the training data. It is known for its efficiency and adaptability, making it a popular choice for deep learning models.

The cost function used in this study is not specified in the provided context, but it is likely a measure of the difference between the predicted and actual values of the output. The Adam optimizer adjusts the model's parameters to minimize this cost function, aiming to improve the model's accuracy.

Additionally, a learning rate decay procedure is implemented to enhance the convergence during training. This procedure adjusts the learning rate, which determines the size of the steps taken during optimization, based on the current training epoch. Specifically, the learning rate is multiplied by a factor of (1 + αp)^β at each epoch, where p is the current training epoch, α is set to 10, and β is set to 0.75. This learning rate decay procedure helps prevent overshooting the minimum cost function value and improves the optimization process's stability.

Furthermore, the batch size is set to 32, and the early stopping procedure is used to avoid overfitting. The early stopping procedure monitors the validation loss during training and stops the training process if the validation loss does not improve for a certain number of epochs, called the patience parameter. In this study, the patience parameter is set to 10, meaning that the training process will stop if the validation loss does not improve for 10 consecutive epochs.

Finally, data augmentation is applied to all extracted patches, including a 90° rotation and vertical and horizontal flips. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size and diversity of the training data by applying various transformations to the existing data. This technique helps improve the model's generalization capacity and reduces the risk of overfitting.

Overall, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of a cost function minimized using the Adam optimizer, a learning rate decay procedure, the early stopping procedure, and data augmentation. These techniques help improve the model's accuracy, stability, and generalization capacity, ensuring that the model performs well on both the training and validation data.
