The provided context does not contain specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of neural networks for bird species recognition using different input features.

In the experiment described, the researchers used both learnable frontends, LEAF-P and SincNet-P, which were initialized by mel-filterbanks. These frontends were used to process the raw input waveform of bird vocalizations. The outputs were log-compressed without normalization. The researchers found that training a neural network directly on the Constant-Q Transform (CQT) was the best choice among the features.

The context also mentions the use of Short-Time Fourier-Transform (STFT) or spectrogram, mel-filterbanks applied on STFT (mel-spectrogram), and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) as input features in other successful contemporary works. However, it does not provide information about the data annotation techniques used in these works.

In general, data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image. It is commonly used in object detection tasks.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel of an object of interest in an image. It is commonly used in semantic segmentation tasks.
3. Class labeling: This technique involves assigning a class label to an object or an image. It is commonly used in image classification tasks.
4. Pixel-wise labeling: This technique involves labeling each pixel of an image with a class label. It is commonly used in image segmentation tasks.
5. Keypoint annotation: This technique involves identifying and labeling key points of an object in an image. It is commonly used in pose estimation tasks.

The choice of data annotation technique depends on the task at hand and the type of data being used. In the case of bird species recognition, the data annotation technique would likely involve labeling each audio clip with the corresponding bird species.
