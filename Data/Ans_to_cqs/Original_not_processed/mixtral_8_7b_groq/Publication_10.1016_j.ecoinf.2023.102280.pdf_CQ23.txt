Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, there are some implicit clues that can give us an idea about the potential strategies used.

Firstly, the context mentions the use of both spectrograms and raw waveform data for training deep noise reduction models. This could imply that the model was trained on a diverse range of data types, which might help improve its generalizability.

Secondly, the context highlights the challenge of collecting clean recordings in bioacoustics applications and the potential need to use captive animals or generate synthetic data. While this could be seen as a limitation, it also suggests that some effort was made to create a more diverse dataset by including both real-world and synthetic data.

Thirdly, the context describes the use of an ablation study to test the data requirements of the Conformer-Based Metric Generative Adversarial Network (CMGAN) model. This could indicate that the researchers investigated the impact of different amounts and types of data on the model's performance, which is another strategy that can help ensure generalizability.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to this query. It is possible that the researchers used other strategies to ensure the generalizability of their model, such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or regularization techniques, but this information is not provided in the context.
