Answer:::

In preparing data for training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved, including data cleaning, transformation, and potentially compression.

Firstly, data cleansing is a mandatory step in data preprocessing to remove incorrect, corrupted, or incomplete data. This step ensures that the data used for training the model is accurate and reliable.

Secondly, data transformation is often required to change the structure or format of the data to make it suitable for the deep learning model. This step may involve normalizing or scaling the data to ensure that all features have similar ranges, which can help the model converge faster and improve its performance. Additionally, data transformation may involve encoding categorical variables or extracting features from raw data, such as images or text.

While data compression is not always necessary for deep learning, it may be useful in some cases to reduce the size of the data or to extract relevant features. Data compression can help reduce memory usage and improve training time, especially when dealing with large datasets.

Normalization and scaling are common techniques used in data preprocessing to prepare data for deep learning models. Normalization involves rescaling numeric data to a range of [0, 1] or [-1, 1], while scaling involves rescaling data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. These techniques can help improve the model's performance by ensuring that all features are on a similar scale, which can prevent some features from dominating others during training.

Therefore, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model may include data cleaning, transformation, and compression, as well as normalization or scaling of the data. These steps are essential to ensure that the data is clean, suitable for the model, and can help improve the model's performance.
