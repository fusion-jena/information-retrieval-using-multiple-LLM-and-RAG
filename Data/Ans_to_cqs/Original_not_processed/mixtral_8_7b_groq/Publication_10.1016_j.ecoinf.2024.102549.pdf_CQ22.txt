Answer: The performance of the deep learning model was evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and a confusion matrix. Among these, accuracy is a measure of the overall correctness of the model, while precision is a measure of how many correctly predicted positive instances there are among all instances predicted as positive. Recall, on the other hand, measures the ability of the model to capture all the positive instances. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Lastly, a confusion matrix was used to provide a more detailed breakdown of the model's performance, showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. These metrics were computed for the final selected pixel size of 21, which had the highest accuracy of 83.87%.
