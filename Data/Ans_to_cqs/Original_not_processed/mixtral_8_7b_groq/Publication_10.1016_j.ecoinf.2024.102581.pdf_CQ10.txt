Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context focuses on the methodology, datasets, and comparison of results with other approaches for plant leaf classification and plant disease classification tasks. It includes details about the hyperparameters of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the performance of various pre-trained models adapted for plant-specific classification tasks. However, there is no mention of the code repository link. You may need to contact the authors or look for the information in the full paper if it is available.
