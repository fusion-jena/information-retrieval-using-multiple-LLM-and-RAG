Answer:::

 The provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. There is no mention of any public repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF where the data and code for this study are stored. The text focuses on the use of TensorFlow for automated species identification of triatomines, a group of insects that transmit Chagas disease. It describes the modifications made to the default settings of TensorFlow and the challenges faced due to small sample sizes and limited validation methods. However, it does not provide a link to the data repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
