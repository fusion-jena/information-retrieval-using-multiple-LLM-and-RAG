The context provided does not give specific information about the deep learning framework used to build the models. However, it does mention the use of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in some of the models. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch have support for building MLPs and CNNs. Therefore, it can be inferred that either TensorFlow or PyTorch (or potentially another deep learning framework) was used to build these models. Further investigation would be required to determine the specific framework used.
