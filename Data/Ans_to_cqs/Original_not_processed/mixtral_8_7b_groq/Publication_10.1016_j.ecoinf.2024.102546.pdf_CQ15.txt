Answer:::

The optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipelines mentioned in the given context are AdamW and multistep decay.

AdamW is used as the optimizer for training models in the study by Wang et al. (2023) on Imagen editor and editbench. AdamW is an extension of the Adam optimizer that includes weight decay, which helps prevent overfitting by adding a regularization term to the loss function.

In the study by Weyler et al. (2023) on domain generalization in crop and weed segmentation, multistep decay is used as the learning rate scheduler. Multistep decay gradually reduces the learning rate at certain epoch milestones, allowing the model to converge to a better minimum and potentially improving generalization.

The other optimization techniques mentioned in the provided context, such as SGD, BCE, VFL, DFL, and NMS, are not directly related to optimizing the model parameters. Instead, they are used for other purposes in the deep learning pipelines.

For instance, SGD (stochastic gradient descent) is a popular optimization algorithm for training neural networks, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the given context. BCE (binary cross-entropy) is a loss function used for binary classification tasks, while VFL (varifocal loss) and DFL (distribution focal loss) are loss functions used for object detection and segmentation tasks. NMS (non-maximum suppression) is a post-processing technique used for removing redundant bounding boxes in object detection tasks.

Therefore, the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipelines mentioned in the given context are AdamW and multistep decay.
