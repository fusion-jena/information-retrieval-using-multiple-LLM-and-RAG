Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in the study employs the Adam optimizer for training the models. The Adam optimizer is a popular optimization algorithm used in machine learning models, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation. It combines the advantages of two other optimization algorithms, AdaGrad and RMSProp, by using the estimated first and second moments of the gradient.

The Adam optimizer is chosen over other optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) due to its ability to adaptively adjust the learning rate for each parameter. This feature allows the algorithm to converge faster and more efficiently, especially for large datasets and complex models.

Furthermore, the study uses a concatenating cosine-annealing linear scheduler with an initial learning rate of 0.0001, decaying by a factor of 0.001â‹…learning rate. This scheduler adjusts the learning rate during the training process, allowing the model to fine-tune the weights and avoid getting stuck in local minima.

The study also employs early stopping to prevent overfitting when no further improvement is observed in the validation set. This technique is useful in preventing the model from memorizing the training data and improving its generalization ability.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in the study uses the Adam optimizer with a concatenating cosine-annealing linear scheduler and early stopping to optimize the training process. These techniques help improve the model's accuracy, convergence, and generalization ability.
