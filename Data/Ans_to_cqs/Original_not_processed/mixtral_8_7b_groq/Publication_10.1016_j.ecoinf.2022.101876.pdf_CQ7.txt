Answer:::

The criteria used to split data for deep learning model training typically involve dividing the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. Although the specific proportions can vary, a common approach is to use 70% of the data for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.

1. Training set: This portion of the data is used to train the model by adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the error between the model's predictions and the actual labels. During this process, the model learns the underlying patterns in the data.

2. Validation set: Also known as the development set or the tuning set, this subset is used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model during the training phase. The validation set helps to tune hyperparameters, such as learning rate or regularization strength, and prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. The validation set is used to monitor the model's performance on new data during the training process.

3. Testing set: This independent subset of data is used to evaluate the model's performance after training. The testing set provides an unbiased estimate of how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data. By comparing the model's predictions on the testing set with the actual labels, you can assess the model's ability to make accurate predictions.

In summary, the criteria for splitting data for deep learning model training involve dividing the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. This division allows for training the model, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating the model's performance on unseen data. The specific proportions used for each subset can vary, but a common approach is to use 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing.
