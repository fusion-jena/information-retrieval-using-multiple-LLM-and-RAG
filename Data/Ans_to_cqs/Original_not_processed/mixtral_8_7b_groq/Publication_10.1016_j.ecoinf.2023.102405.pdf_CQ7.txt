Answer:::

In the context provided, the data splitting approach for training a deep learning model, specifically the AODEGRU model, is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that a 10-fold cross-validation is used for evaluating the performance of the AODEGRU model on a real-time dataset.

Cross-validation is a commonly used technique for evaluating the performance of machine learning models, including deep learning models. In k-fold cross-validation, the dataset is divided into k equal-sized folds or subsets. The model is then trained on k-1 folds, while the remaining fold is used for validation. This process is repeated k times, each time with a different fold used for validation, and the performance metrics are averaged over all k runs.

In the case of the AODEGRU model, the 10-fold cross-validation results are presented in Table 6, which shows the accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, and loss for each fold. However, the specific criteria used for splitting the data into training and validation sets within each fold are not provided.

In general, for deep learning model training, the data is typically split into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model.

Therefore, while the specific criteria used for splitting the data for the AODEGRU model training are not provided in the context, it can be inferred that a cross-validation approach is used for evaluating the model's performance, and a typical data splitting approach for deep learning model training involves using three subsets: training, validation, and testing.
