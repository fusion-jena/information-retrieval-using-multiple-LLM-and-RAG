Answer:::
The text provided does not give explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some implications that suggest certain methods may have been used.

Firstly, the models were evaluated on algal bloom forecasts for the Zhoushan fishery in 2022, which suggests that a temporal split of the data was used. This could mean that the models were trained on data from previous years and then tested on the 2022 data, which would provide a form of temporal generalization test.

Secondly, the models were tested across all seasons, including the peak algal bloom occurrence in summer and the lower occurrence in winter and autumn. This would provide a form of seasonal generalization test, as the models would need to perform well across different conditions.

Thirdly, the hybrid CNN-LSTM model outperformed the LSTM and CNN models, and achieved the highest values for POD and HSS compared to other models. This could suggest that the hybrid model has a better ability to capture complex patterns in the data, which could lead to better generalization performance.

However, without explicit information, it is not possible to confirm whether diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting were used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Therefore, the answer is: The text does not provide sufficient information to determine the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
