Answer:::

 Based on the provided context, the question asks about the frameworks used to build the deep learning model, but the context does not mention any deep learning models or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The IFDS prototype is built using the Python web framework Django, and the frontend is based on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the libraries jQuery and Leaflet. The system is used for predicting forest fire risk, but it does not mention any deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question without additional information.
