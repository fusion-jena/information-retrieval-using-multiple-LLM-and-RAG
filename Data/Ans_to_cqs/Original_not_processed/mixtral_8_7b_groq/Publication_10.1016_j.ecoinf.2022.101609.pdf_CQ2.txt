Answer:::

Based on the information provided, the deep learning pipeline utilizes historic pollution data for estimating future air quality. However, the specific format of this data is not explicitly mentioned in the context. It can be inferred that the data is likely in a structured format, such as a CSV file, since it is processed using machine learning approaches suitable for tabular or time-series data.

Additionally, the deep learning model is developed to make hourly predictions of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentration levels. These pollutant concentration levels could be stored in the data as numerical values, possibly within a CSV file.

There is no mention of image, audio, or video data formats being used in this deep learning pipeline.
