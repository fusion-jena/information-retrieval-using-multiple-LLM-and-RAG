Answer:

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Vision Transformer (ViT), specifically the MobileViT architecture. Initially, transformer architectures were applied to natural language processing (NLP) tasks, leading to successful models such as GPT and BERT. Researchers then adapted the concept of attention from transformers to image classification problems, resulting in Vision Transformers.

Vision Transformers like MobileViT determine relationships between patches of images, similar to how transformers determine relationships between words. MobileViT was chosen for the image classification pipeline due to its small model size, making it suitable for embedded devices.

While the context provided does not explicitly mention other deep learning models like CNN or RNN, it is worth noting that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely used for computer vision tasks, including image classification. However, in this specific pipeline, a Vision Transformer (ViT) is employed.

To summarize, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Vision Transformer (ViT), specifically the MobileViT architecture. This model is based on the transformer architecture and is used for image classification tasks.
