Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The text mainly discusses the manual classification method and potential improvements for mixed-methods analytical historical ecology.

However, it does mention the use of "NAIP" and "massive training datasets" for machine learning methods, implying that they used a large and diverse dataset for training. Additionally, they caution that machine learning methods are still limited by the quality of their inputs, suggesting some consideration of data quality.

In terms of cross-validation, the text does not explicitly mention its use. However, they do discuss the challenge of incorporating all sources of uncertainty into the final result, which is a crucial aspect of model generalizability. They attempted to quantify uncertainty in all stages of analysis but were only able to qualitatively connect their results back to ground truthing data.

Overall, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, it does imply the use of a large and diverse dataset for training machine learning models and acknowledges the importance of incorporating uncertainty in the analysis. However, more information is needed to definitively answer the query.
