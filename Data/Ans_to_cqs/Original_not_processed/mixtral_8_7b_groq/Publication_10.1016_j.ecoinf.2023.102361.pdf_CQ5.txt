The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the datasets were shared by Jiang et al. (2020) through the Github repository: <https://github.com/zhangchuanyin/weed-datasets>. These datasets were used to verify whether the proposed approach can handle issues related to inter-class similarity and intra-class dissimilarity.

The context also mentions that the deep learning models were trained and evaluated on these datasets, and the results were compared with traditional approaches and previous studies. The models used include VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet-50, which are well-known classical architectures suitable for smaller datasets.

Therefore, while the specific names of the datasets are not provided, it is clear that they are related to weed classification and have issues of inter-class similarity and intra-class dissimilarity.
