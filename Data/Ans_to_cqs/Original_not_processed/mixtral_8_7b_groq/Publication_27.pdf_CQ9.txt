The data repository for the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, there are some clues that might help point towards a possible location.

Firstly, the context includes a reference to "IEEE Xplore," which is a digital library for technology and engineering publications. While IEEE Xplore primarily hosts academic papers and articles, it sometimes includes data repositories associated with those publications. Therefore, it's possible that the data repository for the deep learning pipeline could be hosted on IEEE Xplore.

Secondly, the context includes a citation to a paper titled "Deep Learning for Predicting Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity," which was published in the Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling. This journal is hosted on the American Chemical Society's website, which provides a data repository service called "ACS Data." It's possible that the data repository for the deep learning pipeline could be hosted on ACS Data.

Finally, the context includes a reference to "Thueringer Universitaets," which is a university in Germany. Many universities host data repositories for their researchers' work. Therefore, it's possible that the data repository for the deep learning pipeline could be hosted on Thueringer Universitaets's data repository.

In conclusion, while the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, there are some clues that suggest it could be hosted on IEEE Xplore, ACS Data, or Thueringer Universitaets's data repository. Without further information, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer.
