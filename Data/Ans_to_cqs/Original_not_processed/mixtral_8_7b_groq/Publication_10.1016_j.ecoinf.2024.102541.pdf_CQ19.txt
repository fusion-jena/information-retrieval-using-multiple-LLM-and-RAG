Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework was used to build the YOLOv5s model. However, it is worth noting that PyTorch is the framework used by Ultralytics, the creators of YOLOv5. This information is available on the Ultralytics GitHub page, which is the official source for YOLOv5. Therefore, while not explicitly stated in the provided context, it is highly likely that the YOLOv5s model was built using PyTorch.
