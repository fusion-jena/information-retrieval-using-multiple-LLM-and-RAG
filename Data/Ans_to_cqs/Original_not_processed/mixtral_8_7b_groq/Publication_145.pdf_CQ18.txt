Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a validation dataset and tracking the segmentation of objects. The model segmented 1195 objects in total, but the specifics of how these objects were categorized are not provided in the context.

In addition to tracking the segmentation of objects, a custom loss function was used to evaluate the model's performance. This loss function is a sum of two terms: binary cross-entropy and a Dice coefficient-related loss of the three predicted masks. The Dice coefficient is a measure of the similarity between two sets, and it is commonly used in image segmentation tasks to evaluate the overlap between the predicted and ground truth masks.

The model was trained for 300 epochs, and the performance was monitored using a batch size of 24 images. This means that the model's performance was evaluated after every 24 images were processed.

The model was implemented in the programming language R, using the Rstudio interface to Keras and Tensorflow backend. The training of the models took place on an Nvidia RTX2080 graphics card with 8 GB of dedicated memory.

The context does not provide specific details about other strategies that may have been implemented to monitor the model's performance during training, such as early stopping or learning rate scheduling. However, the use of a custom loss function, monitoring the segmentation of objects, and evaluating the model's performance after every batch of images are all common strategies for monitoring model performance during training.

Answer:::
In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a validation dataset, tracking the segmentation of objects, and using a custom loss function that includes binary cross-entropy and a Dice coefficient-related loss of the three predicted masks. The model was trained for 300 epochs with a batch size of 24 images, and the training took place on an Nvidia RTX2080 graphics card with 8 GB of dedicated memory.
