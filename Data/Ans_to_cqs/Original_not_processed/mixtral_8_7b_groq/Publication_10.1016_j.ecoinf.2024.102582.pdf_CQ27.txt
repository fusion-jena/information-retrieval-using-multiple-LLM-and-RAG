Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on mangrove species' status in China and globally, the impact of governmental policies on mangrove evolution, and the use of remote sensing and machine learning approaches for mangrove monitoring.

The Lassalle et al. (2022) study discusses a deep learning-based approach for individual tree crown delineation in mangrove forests using very-high-resolution satellite imagery. However, the context does not provide information on model serialization or platform selection for deploying the trained deep learning model.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
