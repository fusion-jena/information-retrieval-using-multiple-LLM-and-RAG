The provided pieces of context do not directly mention the specific datasets (MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet) that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. However, they do provide some information about the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and satellite imagery for predicting and mapping land use and land cover (LULC) categories.

In the context of ANNs, the accuracy of the training process relies on the quality and quantity of the sample dataset (Yang et al., 2018). Therefore, it is important to use large and diverse datasets to train ANNs and prevent overfitting. Some popular datasets used in deep learning pipelines include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet.

The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) for training and 10,000 images for testing (LeCun et al., 1998). It is a simple and widely used dataset for image classification tasks.

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 colored images of 10 different object classes (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck) for training and 10,000 images for testing (Krizhevsky et al., 2009). It is a more complex dataset than MNIST and is commonly used for object recognition tasks.

The ImageNet dataset consists of over 14 million colored images of 1000 different object classes (Deng et al., 2009). It is a large-scale dataset used for image classification and object recognition tasks.

In the context of satellite imagery, a Pleiades-1B satellite image was used to classify LULC categories within the Wetland of International Importance (WIZ) (Datta et al., 2022). The image was classified using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to obtain different hyperplanes on a multi-axial graph that can separate the data points into various classes with high precision (Datta et al., 2022; Foody and Mathur, 2004). Specifically, eight LULC categories were recognized within the WIZ, viz. open mangrove, Casuarina plantation, mixed vegetation, herbaceous vegetation, bare earth and sand, built-up, waterbody and aquaculture.

Therefore, while the provided pieces of context do not directly mention the specific datasets (MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet) used in deep learning pipelines, they do provide some information about the importance of using large and diverse datasets to train ANNs and the use of satellite imagery for LULC classification tasks.
