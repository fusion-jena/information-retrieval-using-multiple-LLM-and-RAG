The provided context discusses automated machine learning (AutoML) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), but it does not explicitly mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide some background on data pre-processing and feature engineering in AutoML libraries like AutoGluon.

In the context of deep learning, data annotation techniques are crucial for training models, especially for tasks related to computer vision. Some common data annotation techniques include:

1. Image labeling: This is the most basic form of annotation, where an image is assigned a single label indicating its content (e.g., "dog", "car", "building").
2. Bounding box annotation: In this technique, a bounding box is drawn around an object of interest in an image, providing the model with information about the object's location and size.
3. Semantic segmentation: This method involves dividing an image into multiple regions, each corresponding to a specific class or object. It provides a more detailed understanding of the image's content compared to bounding box annotation.
4. Instance segmentation: Similar to semantic segmentation, instance segmentation further differentiates individual instances of the same class. For example, in an image with multiple dogs, instance segmentation would label each dog separately.
5. Keypoint annotation: In this technique, specific points or "keypoints" are marked on an object, such as the joints of a human body or the corners of a building. This is useful for tasks like pose estimation or object detection.

While the provided context does not discuss these specific annotation techniques, it does mention AutoGluon's ability to automate feature engineering and data pre-processing. In the context of deep learning, data annotation can be considered a part of the data pre-processing pipeline. AutoGluon's automation of this process could potentially include automated data annotation, depending on the specific implementation and use case.

In summary, the provided context does not explicitly mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss data pre-processing and feature engineering, which are closely related to data annotation. Common data annotation techniques include image labeling, bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and keypoint annotation.
