The provided context does not mention any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet that are used in a deep learning pipeline for ungulate detection. However, it does suggest the potential for using more sophisticated methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or deep learning for cattle detection.

In general, deep learning models like CNNs require large amounts of annotated data to train. For object detection tasks, this typically involves bounding box annotations around the objects of interest in images. In the context of ungulate detection, this would involve annotating images of various ungulate species, such as Sika Deer or cattle, with bounding boxes around their vocalization signals.

There are several publicly available datasets that could potentially be used for training deep learning models for ungulate detection. For example, the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset contains over 37,000 images of various pet animals, including some hooved animals like horses. The Stanford Cars dataset contains over 16,000 images of cars, which could potentially be used for transfer learning in detecting large ungulate species like elk or moose.

However, it's important to note that these datasets are not specifically tailored for ungulate detection and may not contain the specific types of vocalization signals that are relevant for this task. Therefore, it may be necessary to create a custom dataset specifically for ungulate detection, which would involve collecting and annotating a large number of images of various ungulate species in different environments.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention any specific datasets used for deep learning-based ungulate detection, it does suggest the potential for using CNNs or deep learning for this task. Training deep learning models for ungulate detection would likely require a large annotated dataset of images containing vocalization signals from various ungulate species. Publicly available datasets like the Oxford-IIIT Pet or Stanford Cars datasets could potentially be used for transfer learning, but a custom dataset may be necessary for optimal performance.
