Answer:::

In the deep learning pipeline for computer vision tasks, data annotation is a crucial step that involves labeling or marking up the raw data (images, videos, etc.) to provide meaningful information for the model to learn from. There are various data annotation techniques used, depending on the specific task and the level of detail required. Here are some of the common data annotation techniques used in deep learning:

1. Image Classification: This is the most basic form of data annotation where each image is assigned to a single class or category. For example, in the context of insect detection and identification, an image of a bee could be labeled as 'bee' indicating its class.
