Answer:::

The provided context discusses two metrics that are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models, namely overall accuracy and kappa coefficient.

Overall accuracy is a measure of the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total number of instances in the dataset. It is calculated using Equation (2) in the context, which is not explicitly provided. However, it is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of classification models.

The kappa coefficient, on the other hand, is a measure of the agreement between the predicted values and the actual values, taking into account the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance. It is calculated using Equation (3) in the context, which is also not explicitly provided. However, it is a useful metric to evaluate the performance of models when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

In addition to these two metrics, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score can also be used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models. Precision is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives. It measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all positive instances predicted by the model. Recall is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. It measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances in the dataset. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a balanced measure of both.

However, the provided context does not mention the use of these metrics to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models. It only discusses the use of overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query based solely on the provided context.
