Answer:::
The text does not provide direct information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the research involved training machine learning models, including ANFIS, ANN, and SVM, using different datasets. 

The performance of the BTS-ANFIS model was found to be significantly higher when trained on a reduced dataset (BTS) compared to the model trained on the complete dataset (13 MS). This suggests that some form of model performance monitoring was in place, as the researchers were able to identify and address model overtraining with the full dataset. 

Moreover, the text highlights the use of "evaluation measurements" to compare the performance of the models. While the specific evaluation measurements are not mentioned, this term implies the use of a systematic approach to assess the models' performance. 

In addition, the research demonstrates the effectiveness of using reduced amounts of data, specifically those providing greater variability, for training the ANFIS model. This finding indicates that the researchers likely employed a strategy to assess the quality and variability of the data used for training, and possibly used cross-validation or similar techniques to ensure the models' generalizability. 

In summary, while the text does not explicitly describe the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training, it implies the use of evaluation measurements, cross-validation, and data selection techniques based on variability and representativeness.
