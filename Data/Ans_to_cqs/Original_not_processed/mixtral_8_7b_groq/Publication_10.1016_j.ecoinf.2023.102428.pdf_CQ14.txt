Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text does not mention any specific methods such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization techniques.

However, the context does provide information about the chosen hyperparameters for the model, such as the number of input layer neurons, hidden layer nodes, output layer neurons, requested samples per class, start learning rate, end learning rate, momentum factor, sigmoid constant, iterations, and acceptable RMS. These parameters were set to specific values, but the process of determining these values is not described.

It is possible that the hyperparameters were optimized using a method that is not mentioned in the text, or that they were set based on previous research or expert knowledge. Without additional information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
