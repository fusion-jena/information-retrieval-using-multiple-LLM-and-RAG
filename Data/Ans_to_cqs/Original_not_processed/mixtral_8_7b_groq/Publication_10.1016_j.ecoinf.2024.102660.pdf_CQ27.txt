Answer:::

The text provided discusses the development and testing of a deep learning model for water sun glint detection in UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) water images, but it does not explicitly mention the process of deploying the trained model. However, based on common practices in deep learning model deployment, we can make some educated guesses about the steps that might have been taken.

First, once the model was trained and evaluated on the WSGD dataset, the authors likely saved the model's weights and architecture to a file, a process known as model serialization. This allows the model to be easily loaded and used for making predictions on new data.

Next, the authors would have had to choose a platform for deploying their model. This could be a local server, a cloud-based platform, or even an embedded device, depending on the intended use case. Given that the model was developed for water sun glint detection in UAV images, a likely deployment platform would be a cloud-based service that can receive image data from UAVs in real-time.

Once the platform is chosen, the authors would need to integrate their saved model into the platform. This typically involves writing code to load the model, preprocess input data, make predictions, and postprocess output data. The specifics of this step would depend on the chosen platform and the programming languages and frameworks it supports.

Finally, the authors would need to test the deployed model to ensure that it is working correctly. This would involve feeding it sample data and checking that it produces the expected outputs.

Overall, while the text does not provide explicit details on the deployment of the Res_AUNet model, it is likely that the authors followed a process similar to the one outlined above.
