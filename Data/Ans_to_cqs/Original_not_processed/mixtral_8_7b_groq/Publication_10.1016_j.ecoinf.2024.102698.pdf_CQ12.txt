Answer:::

The synthetic connectivity data in the pipeline is generated using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. GANs are a type of deep learning model that consist of two components: a generator and a discriminator. The generator learns the latent features of the data to generate a synthetic data sample, while the discriminator is a classification model that learns to distinguish between real and synthetic data. The GAN model used here is based on the y-data-synthetic Python package and was chosen for its ability to replicate the sparseness of the original connectivity matrices and its performance in terms of utility metrics.

Additionally, the initial coral cover model is developed using a TVAE model from SDV, which is based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model. VAEs are a type of deep learning model that map the original data to distributions in a lower dimensional latent space, sample data from the latent space, and transform it back to the original space using a decoder. The TVAE model used here learns the spatially dependent distribution of cover for each of the six species of coral modelled in ADRIA.

Therefore, the pipeline uses both GAN and VAE type of deep learning models.
