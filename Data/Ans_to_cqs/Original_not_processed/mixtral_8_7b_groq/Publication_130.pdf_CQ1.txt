Answer:::

In the context provided, the primary method mentioned for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline for bird identification is through the use of RFID technology. This involves fitting RFID readers to a bird's nest, which can then automatically identify and label the birds as they come and go. This method is used to gather large amounts of labeled data, which is crucial for training a deep learning model.

Additionally, the text suggests that this RFID technology is now widely used for research on birds. They also propose a practical way of collecting large labelled datasets for a deep learning approach, which is currently the main bottleneck.

However, the text does not explicitly mention other methods such as surveys or public datasets for collecting raw data in this specific context.

Another important aspect to consider when collecting data for deep learning models is the variation in recording conditions. The text mentions that the capacity for a CNN to work effectively across contexts will be affected by variation in recording conditions, such as light intensity, shadow, or characteristics inherent to the recording quality. To address this, the text suggests ensuring that the training dataset contains sufficient variation to capture the broad range of contexts that the CNN is required for.

In summary, in the provided context, RFID technology is the primary method used for collecting raw data for a deep learning pipeline in bird identification. Other methods such as surveys or public datasets are not explicitly mentioned. Furthermore, it is important to consider the variation in recording conditions when collecting data for deep learning models.
