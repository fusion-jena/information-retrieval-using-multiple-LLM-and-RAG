The provided context does not contain information about deep learning pipelines and their data annotation techniques. However, I can provide a general overview of some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning.

Annotation techniques play a crucial role in training deep learning models, especially in the field of computer vision. These techniques help in associating the correct labels with the corresponding image features. Some common data annotation techniques include:

1. Image-level annotation: In this technique, an image is assigned a single label representing the primary object or scene in the image. For example, an image of a dog would be labeled as 'dog'. This is the simplest form of annotation and is useful for image classification tasks.

2. Bounding box annotation: Here, a bounding box is drawn around the object of interest in an image. Each bounding box is assigned a class label. This technique is useful for object detection tasks, where the goal is to locate and classify objects within an image.

3. Semantic segmentation: In semantic segmentation, each pixel in an image is assigned a class label, representing the object or class to which the pixel belongs. This technique is useful for pixel-level classification and can be used for tasks like scene segmentation, object segmentation, and image restoration.

4. Instance segmentation: Instance segmentation is an extension of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and assigned a unique identifier. This technique is useful for tasks like counting objects, tracking objects, and understanding object interactions in images.

5. Scene graph generation: In this technique, a graphical representation of an image is created, where nodes represent objects and edges represent relationships between objects. Scene graphs can be used for tasks like visual question answering, image captioning, and relationship understanding.

The context provided does mention the use of machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest and Multiple Instance Learning, for image classification tasks. However, it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in those pipelines.
