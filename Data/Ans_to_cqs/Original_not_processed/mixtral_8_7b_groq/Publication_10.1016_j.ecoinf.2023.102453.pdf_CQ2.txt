Answer: Based on the provided context, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are images. Specifically, the pipeline described in the context involves training and deploying deep learning models for image classification tasks.

In the training phase, the dataset is pre-processed, which includes image resizing to make the images suitable for the input image resolution required for the selected models. The pre-processed dataset is then used to train deep learning models, such as Vision Transformers (ViT) and EfficientNetV2B0. These models are based on the transformer architecture, which determines relationships between patches of images.

After training, the models are validated and tested using classification metrics. The context does not mention any other data formats, such as audio, video, or CSV, being used in the deep learning pipeline.

Furthermore, in the deployment phase, the trained model is converted to the TensorFlow Lite format for deployment to an edge device, such as a Raspberry Pi (RPi). The model can then be used on the edge device for classification of unseen images. The RPi or similar edge devices can also be used to run XAI techniques such as Grad-CAM for generating visualizations through heatmaps.

Therefore, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context are images.
