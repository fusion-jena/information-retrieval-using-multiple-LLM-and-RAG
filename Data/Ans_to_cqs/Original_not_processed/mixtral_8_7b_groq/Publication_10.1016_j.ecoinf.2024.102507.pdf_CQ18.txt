Answer:

In the study, the model performance during training was monitored using a combination of techniques, including data augmentation, flattened convolution kernels, and regularization methods like dropout rate and freezing the base model.

Firstly, data augmentation was used to increase the diversity of the training data and reduce overfitting. This technique involves creating new training samples by applying various transformations, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping, to the existing data.

Secondly, flattened convolution kernels were utilized to improve the model's ability to process complex information. Convolution kernels are mathematical operations used to extract features from the input data. By flattening these kernels, the model can capture more intricate patterns and relationships in the data.

Thirdly, regularization methods like dropout rate and freezing the base model were implemented to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability. Dropout rate involves randomly setting a fraction of the model's output values to zero during training, which helps to prevent co-adaptation of feature detectors. Freezing the base model means keeping the pre-trained layers of the model fixed during training, which helps to retain the pre-trained knowledge and prevent overfitting.

The study also used different combinations of parameters, such as the number of bands, bit depth, and dropout rate, to train the ResNet50 and VGG19 + ResNet50 models. The results of these calculations are presented in Tables 8 and 9, respectively. These tables show the impact of different parameter combinations on the model's performance, which can be used to fine-tune the model and improve its accuracy.

Furthermore, the study used a powerful execution environment, including an Intel Core i5-10400F CPU, 64-GB memory, and a ZOTAC GAMING GeForce RTX 3090 GPU, to ensure that the model was trained efficiently and effectively. The GPU environment included CUDA Toolkit 11.3, cuDNN v7.2.1, and TensorFlow-gpu 2.5, which provided the necessary libraries and tools for training deep learning models.

Therefore, the study implemented a comprehensive strategy to monitor the model performance during training, including data augmentation, flattened convolution kernels, regularization methods, and efficient execution environment. These techniques helped to improve the model's accuracy, prevent overfitting, and capture complex patterns in the data.
