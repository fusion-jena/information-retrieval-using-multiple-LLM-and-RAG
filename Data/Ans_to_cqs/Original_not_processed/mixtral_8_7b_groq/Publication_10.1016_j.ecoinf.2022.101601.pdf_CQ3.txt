The provided context does not directly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss a study that uses a deep learning model for predicting permafrost thaw depth. The annotation techniques used in this specific study are not specified, but we can infer that some form of image annotation was used based on the description of the PermaBN model.

PermaBN is a Bayesian deep learning model that integrates various factors affecting permafrost thaw depth, such as soil temperature, soil water input, and vegetation height. The model uses remote sensing data, including satellite images, to predict thaw depth. It is likely that the images were annotated with polygons or other shapes to denote areas of permafrost or different thaw depths.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines can include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in an image. It is commonly used for object detection tasks.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves drawing precise outlines around individual objects in an image and labeling each object instance. It is used for tasks that require identifying and distinguishing between multiple instances of the same object in an image.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves dividing an image into distinct regions or segments and labeling each segment with a class or category. It is used for tasks that require understanding the overall context or scene of an image.
4. Landmark annotation: This technique involves identifying and marking key points or landmarks on objects in an image. It is used for tasks that require understanding the shape or pose of objects.

The specific annotation technique used depends on the task and the data available. In the case of the PermaBN model, it appears that some form of segmentation or polygon annotation was used to denote areas of permafrost or different thaw depths. However, the context does not provide enough information to determine the exact annotation technique used.
