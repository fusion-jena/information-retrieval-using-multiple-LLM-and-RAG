Answer:::

The text provided does not give explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does provide some details about the training process and the model architecture that can be used to infer certain aspects of the deployment process.

The models were implemented in PyTorch, a popular open-source machine learning library. This suggests that the model could be deployed in a variety of ways, since PyTorch models can be run on a variety of platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and cloud-based services.

The models were trained with a batch size of 64 and a base learning rate of 10^-4. The learning rate was reduced by a factor of 0.1 when the validation loss did not improve for 15 consecutive epochs. Weight decay was applied to control the strength of the unit Gaussian prior, with a magnitude of 10^-3. These hyperparameters were chosen empirically, and they may need to be adjusted for deployment in a different context.

The models were trained for approximately 14 days on a single Nvidia RTX2080Ti GPU. This suggests that the models may be computationally expensive to run, and that appropriate hardware resources may need to be allocated for deployment.

The model architecture is visualized in Figure 5, but the details of the figure are not provided. Based on the description of the data flow in the model, it appears that the model may be a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a common type of deep learning model used for image classification tasks.

The text also mentions that the model was trained and tested on remote sensing data analysis. This suggests that the model may be deployed in a remote sensing context, such as satellite image analysis.

In summary, while the text does not provide explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it does provide some details about the training process and the model architecture that can be used to infer certain aspects of the deployment process. The models were implemented in PyTorch, and they may be computationally expensive to run. The model architecture suggests that it may be a CNN, and it was trained and tested on remote sensing data analysis. These factors may need to be taken into account when deploying the model.
