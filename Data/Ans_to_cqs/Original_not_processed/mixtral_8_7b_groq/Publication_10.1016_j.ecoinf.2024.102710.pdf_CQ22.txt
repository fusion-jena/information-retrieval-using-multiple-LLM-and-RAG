Answer:::
In the provided context, the metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is the macro F1 score. The F1 score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, giving equal weight to both measures. The macro F1 score is used in this case due to the significant imbalance of classes in the datasets. Macro precision and macro recall values are also provided in appendix A for reference. However, the context does not mention the evaluation of the model using accuracy or precision alone. It's important to note that the scope of the study did not include optimization for accuracy metrics, but rather focused on efficient strategies that synergize transfer learning and active learning.
