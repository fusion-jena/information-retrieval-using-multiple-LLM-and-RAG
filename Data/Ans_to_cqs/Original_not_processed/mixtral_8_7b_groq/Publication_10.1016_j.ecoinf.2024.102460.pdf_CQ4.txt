Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the description of LSTM and FMOP models for time series data prediction and land use optimization, respectively.

Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize. These techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, and other transformations that generate new samples by applying random perturbations to the existing data. However, the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, we cannot provide a specific answer to the query based on the given context.
