Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in a deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of the Footprint Identification Technique (FIT) for non-invasive survey methods in wildlife studies, but it does not mention any deep learning or data augmentation methods.

The context does mention that Alibhai et al., 2023 simplified the FIT approach, increasing efficiency in the process by requiring fewer landmark points and making it easier to employ on tracks of varying quality. However, this does not necessarily imply the use of data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as there is no relevant information in the given context.
