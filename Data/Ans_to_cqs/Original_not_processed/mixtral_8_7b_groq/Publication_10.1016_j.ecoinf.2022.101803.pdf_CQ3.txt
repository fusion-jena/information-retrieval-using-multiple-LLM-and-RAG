The provided context does not discuss data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Data annotation techniques are crucial in the field of computer vision and image processing, where they are used to label data and make it suitable for training machine learning models. Some common data annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, where a box is drawn around an object of interest in an image; instance segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and labeled in an image; and semantic segmentation, where an image is divided into regions based on the object or class that each region belongs to.

In the provided context, the authors discuss various machine learning techniques, including bagging, boosting, and cross-validation, as well as the use of the XGBoost algorithm and random forests. They also discuss the application of these techniques to a specific problem, but they do not mention data annotation or the use of deep learning.

Therefore, I am unable to answer the query based on the provided context. I would need additional information about the specific deep learning pipeline being used in order to provide an answer.
