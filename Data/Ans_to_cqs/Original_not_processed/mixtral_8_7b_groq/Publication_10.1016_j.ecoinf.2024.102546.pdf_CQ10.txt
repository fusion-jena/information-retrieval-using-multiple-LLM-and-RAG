Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline related to weed datasets. The context mainly discusses various studies and datasets related to weed detection and identification using machine learning and computer vision techniques. Some of the studies have mentioned their use of deep learning methods, but there is no explicit information about the code repositories or implementations of their deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I'm unable to provide a direct answer to the query.
