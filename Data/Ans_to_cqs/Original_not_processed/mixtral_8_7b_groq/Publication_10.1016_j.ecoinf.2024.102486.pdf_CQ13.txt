Answer:::

The provided context discusses various topics related to deep learning, programming, and computational methods, but it does not directly enumerate the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. However, it does mention some tools and techniques that are often used when working with deep learning models, which can give us a general idea of what kind of hyperparameters might be used.

Hyperparameters are configuration variables that are set before the learning process begins. They determine the structure of the model and the learning algorithm. Common examples of hyperparameters include the learning rate, the type of optimizer, the number of layers in the model, the number of units in each layer, and the type of activation function used in each unit.

The context mentions several tools and libraries that are used for deep learning, such as the Deep Learning Toolbox by MathWorks, cuDNN, and Darknet. These tools provide pre-implemented deep learning models and algorithms, and they allow users to specify hyperparameters through configuration options. For example, in the Deep Learning Toolbox, users can specify the learning rate, the type of optimizer, and the number of hidden layers through the 'trainingOptions' function. In cuDNN, users can specify the learning rate, the momentum, and the weight decay through the 'cudnnSetTensorNdDescriptor' function. In Darknet, users can specify the learning rate, the momentum, and the decay through the 'darknet.cfg' file.

The context also mentions some computational methods and techniques that are often used when working with deep learning models. For example, it mentions GPU-based inference, which can speed up the learning process by parallelizing computations. It also mentions particle Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods, which can be used for Bayesian inference in deep learning models. These methods introduce additional hyperparameters, such as the number of particles and the proposal distribution.

In summary, while the provided context does not give a specific list of hyperparameters used in deep learning models, it does mention several tools and techniques that are used for deep learning. These tools and techniques allow users to specify various hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, the type of optimizer, the number of layers, and the type of activation function. Additionally, computational methods such as GPU-based inference and particle Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods introduce additional hyperparameters.
