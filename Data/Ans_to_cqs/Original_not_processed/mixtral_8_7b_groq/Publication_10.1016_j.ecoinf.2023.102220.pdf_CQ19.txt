Answer:::
The deep learning model was built using the TensorFlow framework. This is mentioned in the context when it says "The implementation of the classification methods was carried out in Python using the libraries TensorFlow and Scikit-learn". TensorFlow is a popular open-source library for building and training machine learning models, particularly deep learning models. It provides a comprehensive and flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications. Therefore, we can conclude that the deep learning model was built using TensorFlow.
