Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, the article "Improving Cloud Detection with Machine Learning" does mention that they used Sentinel-2 data, which is a type of Earth observation satellite data. It is common practice to perform certain preprocessing steps on remote sensing data before using it for machine learning tasks.

For Sentinel-2 data, preprocessing steps typically include:

1. Radiometric calibration: This step converts the digital numbers recorded by the sensor into at-sensor radiance.
2. Atmospheric correction: This step corrects for the effects of the atmosphere on the radiance measurements. This can be done using various methods such as the 6S algorithm or the dark object subtraction (DOS) method.
3. Geometric correction: This step corrects for the distortions in the image due to the sensor's viewing geometry and Earth's curvature. This can be done using ground control points or by co-registering the image with a reference image.
4. Scene classification: This step classifies each pixel in the image into a land cover class. This can be done using various methods such as decision trees or random forests.
5. Feature extraction: This step extracts relevant features from the image that can be used as input to a machine learning model. This can include spectral indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or texture features.

In the Ecological Informatics article, the authors mention that their approach "required no further user input, pre- or post-processing steps, and can therefore be seen as more objective, more comparable, and robust across time steps." This suggests that they may have performed some or all of these preprocessing steps prior to their analysis, but they do not provide specific details.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give specific information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, it is reasonable to assume that common preprocessing steps for remote sensing data, such as radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, geometric correction, scene classification, and feature extraction, were performed.
