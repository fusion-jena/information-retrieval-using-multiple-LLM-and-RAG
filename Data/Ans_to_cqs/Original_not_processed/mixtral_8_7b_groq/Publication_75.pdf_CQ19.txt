Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about which framework was used to build the deep learning model. The text focuses on describing the architecture of the proposed model, SeedNet, which is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with six learnable layers, five of which are convolutional, and the last one is fully-connected. The ReLU activation function is applied to the output of every convolutional layer, and a Max pooling strategy with a 3 × 3 filter size and 1 × 1 stride is employed between successive convolutional layers. The input image size is 224 × 224 × 3, and the output of the last fully-connected layer is fed to a N-way softmax, which produces a distribution over the N class labels to predict. However, the context does not mention any specific deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or others, that was used to implement this architecture.
