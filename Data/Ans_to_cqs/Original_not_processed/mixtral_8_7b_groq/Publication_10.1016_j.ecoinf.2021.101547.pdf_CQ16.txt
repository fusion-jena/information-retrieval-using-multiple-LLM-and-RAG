Answer:::

The training of a deep learning model, such as ResNet-50, typically involves several iterations of learning and updating internal parameters using mini-batches of training images. The criteria used to determine when training is complete can vary, but a common approach is to monitor the validation loss and stop training when the loss plateaus or shows only minimal improvement over a certain number of epochs.

In the context provided, the network performs a new round of learning on a mini-batch of images, focusing relatively more on images with higher loss scores, and updates its internal parameters before proceeding to the next training iteration with a new mini-batch of images. A full cycle through the entire set of training images is referred to as an 'epoch', and the number of iterations per epoch is equal to the total number of training images divided by the mini-batch size.

The mini-batch size is user-adjustable and limited by the amount of memory available to the GPU. Training is performed iteratively on small 'mini-batches' of the training images, and the network estimates the probability that the image represents each of the different user-defined classes. The network then computes a 'loss' score for the image based on the difference between the estimated class probability scores and the actual scores.

The criteria used to determine when training is complete can include monitoring the validation loss and stopping training when the loss plateaus or shows only minimal improvement over a certain number of epochs. Additionally, other criteria such as training time, computational resources, and model performance on a separate test set may also be considered.

In summary, the criteria used to determine when training is complete for a deep learning model like ResNet-50 typically involve monitoring the validation loss and stopping training when the loss plateaus or shows only minimal improvement over a certain number of epochs. Other factors, such as training time, computational resources, and model performance on a separate test set, may also be considered.
