Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context discusses the use of a repository for pivotal operations, a runoff scenario requiring early intervention, a mining process for data acquisition, and details about in situ and satellite data sources. However, it does not mention any specific postprocessing steps for model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to the query based on the given context.
