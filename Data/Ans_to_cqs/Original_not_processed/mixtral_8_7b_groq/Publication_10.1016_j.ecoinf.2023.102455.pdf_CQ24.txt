Answer:::

In the context of deep learning, randomness can be introduced in various stages of the pipeline, such as the initialization of weights and biases, the order of training samples, and the selection of hyperparameters. Strategies to handle randomness include the use of random seeds, cross-validation, and regularization techniques.

A random seed value is a fixed number used to initialize the random number generator, ensuring that the same sequence of random numbers is produced across different runs. This is particularly useful for reproducibility purposes, as it allows researchers to obtain consistent results when repeating the same experiment. For instance, in the first and second CNN-BiGRU models mentioned in the context, the random seed value is not explicitly stated, but the use of a fixed seed value can be inferred as it is a common practice in deep learning.

Cross-validation is another strategy used to handle randomness in deep learning. It involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on different subsets of the data, and evaluating its performance on the remaining portions. This process is repeated for each fold, providing a more robust estimate of the model's generalization ability. Cross-validation can be applied in nested or rolling basis, as mentioned in the context.

Regularization techniques are also used to handle randomness in deep learning by reducing overfitting and improving the model's generalization performance. Regularization methods, such as L1 and L2 regularization, add a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging large weight values and promoting smoother models. In the context, the Regularization_coefficient and kernel_parameter values are used in the MVMD-CNN-BiGRU model, indicating the application of regularization techniques.

In summary, handling randomness in deep learning involves the use of random seeds, cross-validation, and regularization techniques. These strategies help ensure reproducibility, assess model performance, and reduce overfitting, ultimately leading to more reliable and accurate models.
