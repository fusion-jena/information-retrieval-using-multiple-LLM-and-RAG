The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model in question. However, it is common practice to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which is well-suited for the matrix operations used in deep learning. Additionally, Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) developed by Google are specifically designed to accelerate machine learning workloads. Therefore, it is possible that GPUs or TPUs were used for training the deep learning model in the context, but this information is not explicitly stated.
