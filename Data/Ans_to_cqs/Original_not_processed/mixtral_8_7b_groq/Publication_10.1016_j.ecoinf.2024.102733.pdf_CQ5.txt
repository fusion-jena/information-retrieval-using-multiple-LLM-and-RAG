Answer:

The context provided does not give information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It focuses mainly on the description of the deep learning pipeline, the architecture of the MLP employed, and the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the models.

The pipeline involves using an Autoencoder model for unsupervised pre-training to extract latent representations from the input data. Then, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) is trained for the classification of fish events using these latent representations. The MLP employs four fully connected layers, with the third layer provided with Batch Normalization. The input to the MLP is of size 512, consisting of learned features extracted from the diffusion model.

The training of the MLP involves using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate adjusted by a scheduler when the network reaches a plateau. The MLP is trained for several epochs with various parameter configurations and regularization techniques, including both Cross-Entropy and Focal Loss. Regularization techniques such as weight decay, batch normalization, and dropout are also used.

The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as Macro F1, Weighted F1, Macro G-mean, and Weighted G-mean. The results show that the proposed method with Focal Loss and SMOTE outperforms the other methods.

Therefore, while the context provides valuable information about the deep learning pipeline, it does not specify the datasets used.
