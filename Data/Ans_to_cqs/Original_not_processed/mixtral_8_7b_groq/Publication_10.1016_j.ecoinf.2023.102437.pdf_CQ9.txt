Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no clear information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Ham, Kim, and Luo (2019). The study mentions using data from the NOAA Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, but it does not specify where the data and code for the deep learning pipeline are stored or shared.

It is a common practice in scientific research to share data and code to ensure reproducibility and transparency. However, the context provided does not include information on this aspect of the study.

In other studies mentioned in the context, such as those by Tan et al. (2018) and Yan et al. (2020), there is no information about the data repository either.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query. It is recommended to contact the authors of the study directly to inquire about the data repository.
