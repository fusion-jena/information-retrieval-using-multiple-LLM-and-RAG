Answer: In the training process, a 10-fold cross-validation method is implemented to monitor the model performance during training. This method involves dividing the training and validation set into ten parts, where nine parts are used as a training set and one part is used as a validation set. This process is repeated ten times, with a different part used as the validation set each time. The mean value of the ten results is then used to estimate the accuracy of the model.

Additionally, the training data has a ratio of 7:14:1:5:7 for the five types of land use suitability samples, which indicates an imbalance in the categorical data. To address this issue, a weighting strategy is implemented during the training process. Specifically, a relatively large weight is assigned to categories with fewer samples, while a smaller weight is assigned to categories with more samples. This approach helps improve the performance of the model for categories with small sample sizes.

Furthermore, batch normalization is performed on the input data, which are 40-dimensional data. Batch normalization involves calculating the mean and variance of each channel in the current batch and normalizing the input data using these statistics. The normalized output is then scaled and shifted using the scale parameter γ and the shift parameter β to obtain the final output. This process helps reduce the differences in the distribution between different batches of training data and between the training set and the test set.

Overall, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a 10-fold cross-validation method, implementing a weighting strategy for the imbalanced categorical data, and performing batch normalization on the input data.
