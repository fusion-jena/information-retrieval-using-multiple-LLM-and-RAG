Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention some relevant information regarding the model architecture and training process.

The models in question are Deeplabv3+ and Unet, which are used for semantic segmentation tasks. Deeplabv3+ uses a MobileNetV2 backbone with an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module in the encoding stage. On the other hand, Unet has an encoder-decoder structure with shortcut connections, making it suitable for biomedical image segmentation tasks.

As for the training process, the Unet model's input is a 512 × 512 pixels image, and it consists of multiple convolutional blocks with a 3 × 3 convolutional kernel layer, batch normalization, and an activation function. The learning rate was set to 0.01, and the SGD optimizer, ReLu activation function, and Dice loss function were used.

In terms of model deployment, the context only mentions that the models were used for remote sensing image segmentation tasks. Therefore, we can infer that the models were likely deployed on a server or cloud platform to process large satellite or aerial images.

An essential step in deploying a deep learning model is model serialization, where the trained model is saved in a file format that can be loaded later for inference. Common model serialization formats include h5, json, and pb files. However, the context does not provide information on the specific model serialization format used.

In summary, while the context provides valuable information about the model architectures and training processes, it does not explicitly mention the steps taken to deploy the trained deep learning models. Therefore, we can only infer that the models were likely serialized and deployed on a server or cloud platform for remote sensing image segmentation tasks.
