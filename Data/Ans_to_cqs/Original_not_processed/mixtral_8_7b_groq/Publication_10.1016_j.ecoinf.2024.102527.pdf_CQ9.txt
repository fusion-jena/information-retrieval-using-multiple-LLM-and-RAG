Answer:::

The text provided does not give information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It mentions that they used the ImageNet dataset, which is a well-known dataset in the field of deep learning, but it does not specify where they obtained it from or if they shared their specific dataset used in the study. The SS and LSM datasets mentioned are camera trap image datasets, and the text mentions that they kept the integrity of events during data splitting, but it does not provide information on where these datasets can be accessed.

In addition, the text mentions that they used a Dell PowerEdge C4130 rack server with two Tesla K80 GPUs and 256 GB of memory, and the PyTorch 1.7.1 platform for the deep learning environment. However, it does not mention if the code or models used in the study are available for others to use.

Therefore, I am unable to answer the query as the information is not provided in the text. It is best to contact the authors or look for additional information in the related publications or repositories.
