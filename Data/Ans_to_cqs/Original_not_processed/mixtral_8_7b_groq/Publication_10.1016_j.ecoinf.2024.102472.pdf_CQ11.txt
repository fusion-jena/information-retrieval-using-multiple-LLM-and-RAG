Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context includes several studies that have used different datasets for training their machine learning models, such as hyperspectral image classification in edge computing environments (De Lucia et al., 2022), integrated multispectral and SAR data for high-performance prediction of eucalyptus biomass (Domingues et al., 2020), and Landsat 8 multispectral sensor in quantifying aboveground biomass in uMgeni catchment, South Africa (Dube & Mutanga, 2015). However, none of these studies have provided a data repository link for their deep learning pipeline.

Furthermore, the study mentioned using Planetscope eight-band high-resolution image data, vegetation indices, texture features, and terrain variables for retrieving carbon stock estimates over a reforested urban landscape in South Africa using XGBoost and ANN models. However, the study did not provide a data repository link for the Planetscope image data or any other dataset used in the study.

Therefore, I regret to inform you that there is no data repository link available for the deep learning pipeline used in the study based on the provided context.
