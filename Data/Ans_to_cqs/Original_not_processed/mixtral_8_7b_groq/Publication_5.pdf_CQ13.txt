Answer:::
The specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, we do know that the model has 5 hidden layers and 85,569 trainable parameters. The training process involved iterative exposure of the training data to the network until the loss function reached its minimum value, which occurred after approximately 5000 iterations with a training batch size of 1024. The context also mentions that iterative grid search parameter tuning was performed on a small subset of the data, but it does not specify which parameters were tuned.

In general, common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include learning rate, number of hidden layers, number of neurons per layer, activation function, batch size, number of iterations, and regularization techniques such as dropout or weight decay. The choice of these hyperparameters can significantly affect the performance of the model.

In the context, it is mentioned that a small subset of the data was used for iterative grid search parameter tuning. This suggests that some hyperparameters were likely tuned using a grid search approach, where different combinations of hyperparameters are tried and the best combination is selected based on performance metrics. However, the specific hyperparameters that were tuned are not provided.

Therefore, while we cannot provide the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, we can say that common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include learning rate, number of hidden layers, number of neurons per layer, activation function, batch size, number of iterations, and regularization techniques. Some of these hyperparameters may have been tuned using a grid search approach, but the specific hyperparameters are not provided in the context.
