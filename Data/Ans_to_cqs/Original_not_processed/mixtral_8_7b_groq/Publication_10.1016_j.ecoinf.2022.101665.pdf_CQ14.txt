Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the Random Forest models were optimized. The text mentions that the models were implemented using the ranger package with the respect.unordered.factors option set to TRUE, but it does not specify any method for hyperparameter tuning such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization technique. It is possible that the out-of-the-box hyperparameter settings of the ranger package were used without further optimization. However, without more information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
