Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the performance of the runs was studied using TensorBoard, which can be used to monitor various metrics during training, such as loss and accuracy. It is common to use criteria like a validation loss plateau or convergence of the validation accuracy to determine when training is complete. Additionally, the context mentions that the algorithm was asked to exceed a certain threshold of variability in its predictions, which could potentially be used as a stopping criterion. However, without further information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
