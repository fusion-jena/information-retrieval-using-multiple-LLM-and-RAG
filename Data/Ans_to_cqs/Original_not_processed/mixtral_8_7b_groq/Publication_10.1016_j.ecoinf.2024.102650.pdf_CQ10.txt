Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository link of a deep learning pipeline. The texts mention various studies related to text classification, knowledge mining, social media influence on air quality, named entity recognition, and public participation in environmental governance. However, there is no reference to a deep learning pipeline and its code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested link to GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
