Answer:

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the application of pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) image representations to a coral reef classification problem, specifically using the VGGnet architecture. The authors fine-tuned the network's weights using the Benthoz15 dataset, which consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. They then analyzed coral reefs in the Abrolhos Islands and generated coral maps to quantify the coral population and investigate trends in coral population.

However, the text does not mention where the code repository for this deep learning pipeline is available. It is possible that the authors did not make the code publicly available or that it was not specified in the text provided. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
