Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using accuracy metrics on the train, validation, and test datasets for both raw and pre-processed data. This is demonstrated in the table provided, where the accuracy of four models (AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201) is measured at different stages of the training process. 

The raw data accuracy is calculated for the train, validation, and test datasets. Similarly, the pre-processed data accuracy is also calculated for the train, validation, and test datasets. The pre-processing step here could be the transformation from RGB to Lab color space as described in the context.

Additionally, the performance of the models is further evaluated by swapping the testing sets (source â†’ target) to see how well each model generalizes. This is shown in Table 5, where the accuracy of each model is tested using the raw data as the source and the pre-processed data as the target, and vice versa.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of confusion matrices, specifically for the VGG-19 architecture, which is a tool to visualize the performance of a classification model. It can help identify patterns in misclassification and give a more detailed view of how the model is performing.

Lastly, the context also mentions the use of SmoothGrad, a method that plots a point cloud where the density denotes the input space relevance. This can provide a visual representation of which regions of the input space the network is focusing on the most when classifying.

Therefore, the strategy to monitor model performance during training involves using accuracy metrics, confusion matrices, and methods like SmoothGrad to visualize and understand the model's performance and its focus areas.
