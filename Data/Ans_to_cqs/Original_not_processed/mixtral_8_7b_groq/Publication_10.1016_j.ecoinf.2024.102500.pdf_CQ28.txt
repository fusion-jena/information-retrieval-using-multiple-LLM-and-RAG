The provided context does not include information about the deployment platform for the deep learning model. There are details about the Lazy Predict library, which is a Python library used for machine learning, and the use of various hyperparameters for model evaluation and hyperparameter selection. However, there is no mention of any cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform being used for deploying a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
