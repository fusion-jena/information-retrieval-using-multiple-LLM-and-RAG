Answer:::

The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is indicated that the pipeline involves training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other state-of-the-art model architectures on bioclimatic data. The bioclimatic data was likely extracted from a database or a collection of datasets, but the specific source is not provided.

Furthermore, the pipeline includes the use of the iNaturalist plant photograph database, which contains a large number of RGB photographs of plants from various biomes and regions around the world. These photographs were used as input data for the CNNs to extract a set of plant functional traits.

Therefore, while the specific datasets used in the pipeline are not explicitly named, it can be inferred that they include bioclimatic data and a large collection of plant photographs from the iNaturalist database.
