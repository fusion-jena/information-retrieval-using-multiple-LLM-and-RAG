Based on the provided context, there is no information about any deep learning pipeline or data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The study focuses on feature selection for logistic regression and random forest models using two feature sets, 'random-CV' and 'spatial-CV', and evaluating their performance via random cross-validation and spatial cross-validation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer related to data augmentation techniques in the context of this study.
