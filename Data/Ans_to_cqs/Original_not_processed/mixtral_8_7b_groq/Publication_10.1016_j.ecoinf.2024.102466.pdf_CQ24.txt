The provided article does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does discuss the impact of noise on the performance of deep learning algorithms in the context of bird detection from camera trap datasets. While this is not a direct answer to the query, it is worth noting that noise in the dataset can be a source of randomness that affects the algorithm's performance.

In the context of the article, noise in the bird detection dataset can arise from various sources, such as vandalism, animal damage, loss of power, extreme weather, and environmental clutter. This noise can make it difficult for the algorithm to accurately learn the features of a particular bird species during training, thus affecting its detection and recognition capabilities.

To handle noise in the dataset, the article describes the construction of a wild bird dataset consisting of 15 species and 9717 images. The study investigated the accuracy of eight mainstream deep learning methods for bird identification, analyzing the impact of species, target size, and model frameworks on model accuracy.

While the article does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does highlight the importance of appropriate training times for different models. The study found that not all models are better with more training times, and choosing appropriate training times for different models can be beneficial in saving computing resources.

In summary, while the provided article does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does touch on the impact of noise in the dataset on the algorithm's performance. The article also highlights the importance of appropriate training times for different models in handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
