Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various studies and methods related to machine learning and species distribution modeling, but it does not mention where the data used in these studies is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.

It is possible that the data repository is not specified in the given sources because they focus on the methods and results of the studies rather than the data itself. In such cases, it is common to contact the authors of the studies directly to inquire about the data.

In summary, I don't know the answer to the query about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.
