The context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization methods.

However, the authors conducted a comparative analysis of several models with similar structures, including ResNet, ResNeXt, and ResNeSt. They evaluated these models based on various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score. The results showed that the integration of both CA and SA modules enhanced the models' ability to classify medicinal and poisonous plants. Specifically, the ResNeSt101 + SCAM model performed slightly better than the ResNeSt50 + SCAM model, with the lowest number of parameters and the best performance among the other models.

Additionally, the authors developed a machine learning-based algorithm to evaluate the maturity level of hawthorns. They used an image-based deep learning network and machine vision system to predict soil texture. However, the context does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of these models were optimized.

In another study, the authors proposed a model for identifying different plants using a deep convolutional neural network based on global average pooling. They achieved high accuracy rates, demonstrating the excellent performance of the proposed model. However, the context does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of this model were optimized.

In conclusion, while the authors conducted a comparative analysis of several models and developed various algorithms and models, the context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of these models were optimized. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
