Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it does mention that the authors have curated a subset of 330 videos from the GBIF database for their study. It is also mentioned that every frame from these videos has been manually annotated, indicating whether or not it contains an animal. The training and validation split used to tune parameters and evaluate the system has also been provided. However, there is no information about where this data can be accessed or if it has been shared on any data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
