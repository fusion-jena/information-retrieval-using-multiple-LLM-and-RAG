Answer:::
The provided context does not specify where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It mentions the use of a dataset of 42 water quality parameters (WQPs) from 13 monitoring sites along the Santiago-Guadalajara River, which underwent pre-processing and outlier detection. However, it does not provide information on where this dataset or the resulting models can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.

It is important to note that data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF are excellent platforms for sharing and preserving research data, and it is good practice to make datasets and models publicly available for reproducibility and reuse. However, without further information, it is not possible to determine whether the authors of the study in question have deposited their data in one of these repositories.
