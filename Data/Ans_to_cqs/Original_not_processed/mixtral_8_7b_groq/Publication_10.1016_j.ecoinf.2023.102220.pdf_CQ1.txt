Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on presenting the PBP method, a new machine learning approach that is an improvement over current state-of-the-art tools, especially for non-specialists in fields like ecology.

However, the context does mention that the study is a case study, and the PBP method was tested using time series data. This implies that the raw data was collected over time, likely using sensors or surveys to monitor the presence or absence of a particular pest. Additionally, the authors mention that they used public datasets, suggesting that some of the data may have been obtained from pre-existing sources.

To summarize, while the context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data, it can be inferred that the data was collected over time using sensors or surveys and supplemented with public datasets.

Answer::: 

The provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the raw data was collected over time using sensors or surveys and supplemented with public datasets, based on the mention of a case study using time series data and public datasets.
