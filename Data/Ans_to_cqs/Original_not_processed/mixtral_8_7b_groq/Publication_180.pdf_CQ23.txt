Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated that diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting were used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the model was calibrated for Mexican and Brazilian species using different numbers of training steps, and two factors were considered to find the optima for training TensorFlow: correct identification rate and processing time. This suggests that the model's performance was evaluated using the identification rate, which could be a measure of the model's ability to generalize.

Additionally, it is mentioned that the validation percentage was adjusted from the default setting of 10% to 16% due to small numbers of images available for some species. This adjustment could be seen as a way to ensure that the model is exposed to a more diverse set of data during the validation process, which could help improve the model's ability to generalize.

However, it is important to note that, in general, deep learning models can be sensitive to overfitting, which can negatively impact their ability to generalize. To mitigate this, it is common practice to use techniques such as data augmentation, regularization, cross-validation, and stratified splitting. Since these techniques are not mentioned in the provided context, it is unclear if they were used to ensure the generalizability of the model.

In summary, while the provided context suggests that some measures were taken to evaluate the model's performance and ensure that it is exposed to a diverse set of data, it is not explicitly stated that diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting were used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
