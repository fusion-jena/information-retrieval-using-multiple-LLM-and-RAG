Answer:::

The data format used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the study is primarily multi-spectral image data. More specifically, the researchers used Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite images, which consist of eleven spectral bands with varying spatial resolutions. These spectral bands range from visible light to near-infrared and shortwave-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The use of multi-spectral image data allows the deep learning models to differentiate spectral signatures of burned and unburned areas in the study region.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in this study primarily uses multi-spectral image data (Landsat 8 OLI satellite images) as input.
