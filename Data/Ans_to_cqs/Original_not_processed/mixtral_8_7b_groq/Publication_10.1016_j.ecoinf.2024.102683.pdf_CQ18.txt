Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the models was evaluated at different stages of training.

In Figure 8, the performance of the models is reported at different epochs, which suggests that the models' performance was being monitored throughout the training process. Specifically, Figure 8a shows the performance of the SCAM-Herb model based on the Tree-CA module with 50% of the dataset and 100 epochs, achieving an accuracy of 96.64%. Additionally, Figure 8b, 8c, and 8d show the performance of the SCAM-Herb model based on the gated-CA, mixed-CA, and GAP-CA modules, respectively, with varying amounts of training data and epochs.

Furthermore, the context states that the models were evaluated based on various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score. These metrics were calculated for each model, and the results were presented in Table 3. The table shows that the ResNeSt101 + SCAM model had the best performance among the other models, with accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score of 99.56%, 99.53%, 99.76%, 99.54%, and 99.64%, respectively.

Therefore, while the specific strategy for monitoring the models' performance during training is not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the models' performance was being evaluated at different stages of training based on various performance metrics.
