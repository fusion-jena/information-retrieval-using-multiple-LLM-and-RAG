Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the specific frameworks used to build a deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text focuses on the use of the Maxent model for species distribution modeling in marine conservation, specifically for seahorses (H. guttulatus and H. hippocampus). It discusses the use of the AICc (corrected Akaike Information Criterion) for model selection and the importance of model complexity and goodness-of-fit. However, it does not mention any deep learning frameworks.
