Answer:::
The DeepLabV3+ model training process was executed on a GeForce RTX 3070 GPU. This specific type of GPU was used for handling the computational requirements of the deep learning model during both the training and inference stages. GPUs are commonly used for deep learning tasks due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which is essential for the efficient handling of large datasets and complex computations involved in training deep learning models. In this case, the GeForce RTX 3070 GPU was utilized to manage the computational needs of the DeepLabV3+ model while training on remote sensing images and semantic labels of land cover classes, which were divided into 32 Ã— 32 pixel image blocks for input.

An additional note is that the selection of GPU for deep learning tasks is influenced by factors such as memory size, computational power, and cost. The GeForce RTX 3070 GPU offers a balance between these factors, making it a suitable choice for the training of the DeepLabV3+ model in this investigation. However, other hardware resources like Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) could also be used for deep learning tasks, depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the project.
