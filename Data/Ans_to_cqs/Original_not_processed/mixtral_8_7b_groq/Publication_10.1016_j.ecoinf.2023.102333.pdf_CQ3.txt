Answer:::
The provided article abstracts and titles do not directly mention the data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. However, they do discuss various applications of deep learning in image processing, remote sensing, and land-use/land-cover classification. Common annotation techniques in deep learning image applications include:
1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image. It is widely used in object detection tasks, where the goal is to locate and identify objects within an image.
2. Semantic segmentation: This method involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class. It is used for image segmentation tasks, where the goal is to partition an image into multiple regions according to the object category.
3. Instance segmentation: This technique combines object detection and semantic segmentation. It involves detecting and segmenting individual objects within an image, providing a mask for each instance of the object.

These annotation techniques are crucial for training deep learning models, as they provide the ground truth labels required for supervised learning. The articles mentioned in the context discuss various aspects of deep learning model development, including hyperparameter optimization and architecture design, but they do not explicitly cover data annotation techniques.
