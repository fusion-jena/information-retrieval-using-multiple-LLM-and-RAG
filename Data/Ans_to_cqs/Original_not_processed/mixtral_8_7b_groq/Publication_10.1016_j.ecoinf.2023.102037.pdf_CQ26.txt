Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of a specific dataset and image processing techniques but does not explicitly mention the strategies used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the importance of considering limitations in data splitting procedures and the dissimilarity of insect classes in the dataset.

In the context of deep learning, addressing data bias during preprocessing can involve several techniques, including:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria (such as class labels) and then randomly splitting the data while preserving the distribution of these subgroups. This can help ensure that each subset of the data (e.g., training, validation, or test set) contains a representative sample of each class.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of a particular class in the dataset to balance the class distribution. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class in the dataset to balance the class distribution. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population being studied. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards a particular subset of the population.

In the context of the provided research, it is possible that the authors used one or more of these techniques to address data bias during preprocessing. However, the specific techniques used are not mentioned in the provided context.
