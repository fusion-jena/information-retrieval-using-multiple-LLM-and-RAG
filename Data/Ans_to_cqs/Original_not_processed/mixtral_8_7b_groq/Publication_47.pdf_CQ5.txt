Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline developed in the study for automating the conservation evaluation of the Orchidaceae family does not use any of the standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, this pipeline uses a custom dataset specific to the task of predicting the conservation status of orchid species. The dataset is derived from digitally available occurrence records of orchid species, which include geographic, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic features.

The geographic features consist of mean latitude and longitude, longitudinal and latitudinal range, extent of occurrence (EOO), area of occupancy (AOO), number of locations (sensu IUCN), and occurrence records. The climatic features include mean values of 19 bioclim variables from Karger et al. (2017). The biome features represent the presence of species in 14 biomes from Olson et al. (2001), and the anthropogenic features include the mean Human Footprint Index from the Wildlife Conservation Society & International Earth Science Information Network (2005).

The dataset is split into a training set (90% of the entries), a test set (10%), and a validation set (20% of the training set). The validation set is shifted five times to quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy. The neural network with the lowest cross-entropy loss is then used to predict the conservation status of all orchid species at two levels: binary (possibly threatened vs. not threatened) and detailed (CR, EN, VU, NT, and LC).

Therefore, the dataset used in this deep learning pipeline is a custom dataset derived from occurrence records of orchid species, which includes geographic, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic features.
