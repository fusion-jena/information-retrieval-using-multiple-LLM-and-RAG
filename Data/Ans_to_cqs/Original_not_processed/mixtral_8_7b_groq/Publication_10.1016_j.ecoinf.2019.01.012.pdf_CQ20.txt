Answer:::
The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only describes the details of the training process, such as the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with ReLU activation for convolutional layers and ELU activation for the fully connected layer. The optimizer used is the adaptive ADAM with a learning rate of 0.0001, and the training was performed with a batch size of 256 over 16,290 iterations (90 epochs). However, it does not mention any details about the hardware resources used for this training process. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
