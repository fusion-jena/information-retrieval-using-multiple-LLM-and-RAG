Answer: The data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the text is images. The study focuses on counting wildebeest within survey images, and the deep learning method employed is a multi-layer deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) that processes these image data. The images are tiled into smaller subimages and passed through the YOLO DCNN, which is trained using pretrained weights from the COCO dataset. The COCO dataset is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset that primarily uses images as its data format. Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in this study works with image data.
