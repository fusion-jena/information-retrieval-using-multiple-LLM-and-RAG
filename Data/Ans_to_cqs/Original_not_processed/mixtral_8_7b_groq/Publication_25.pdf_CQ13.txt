Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. Hyperparameters are configuration variables that are set before the learning process begins. They include learning rate, number of hidden layers, number of neurons, optimizer, batch size, and many others.

In the first reference, Wu and Prasad (2018) discuss a semi-supervised deep learning model for hyperspectral image classification, but they do not provide details about the hyperparameters used in their model. Similarly, in the second reference, Romero et al. (2014) introduce FitNets, a framework for training thin deep networks, but they do not mention the specific hyperparameters used in their experiments.

The third reference, Erhan et al. (2009), investigates the difficulty of training deep architectures and the effect of unsupervised pre-training. However, they do not provide information about the hyperparameters used in their deep learning models.

The fourth reference, Weinstein and White (2019), present a LIDAR-based unsupervised detection method for generating initial training data for a deep learning model, but they do not discuss the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.

Finally, in the fifth reference, Dalponte et al. (2019) propose a semi-supervised framework for tree-centric mapping of forest carbon density using airborne laser data and labeled data. They mention that a deep learning-based approach holds the potential for large-scale actionable information on natural systems to be derived from remote sensing data. However, they do not provide details about the hyperparameters used in their deep learning model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
