Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct information given about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context contains several strings of characters that could be part of a URL, but they are not a complete, valid URL that can be accessed as a code repository.

Additionally, the context includes a reference to IEEE Xplore, which is a digital library for technology and engineering publications. It is possible that the deep learning pipeline is described in one of the publications available on IEEE Xplore, but the context does not provide enough information to identify the specific publication or its location in the database.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. However, I would suggest checking IEEE Xplore or other academic databases for publications related to the deep learning pipeline, which may include a link to the code repository.
