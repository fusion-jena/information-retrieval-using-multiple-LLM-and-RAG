The provided context does not contain information about a deep learning pipeline. However, it does contain information about a machine learning study that used water quality data to train models. The water quality data is in a tabular format, likely stored in a CSV file, with different parameters (such as pH, temperature, and various chemical concentrations) represented as columns and individual measurements represented as rows. The study used this data to train three machine learning models: Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The data was used to calculate various evaluation measurements, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2). The study found that the selection of the most representative and variable scenarios from the dataset improved the performance of the machine learning models. Therefore, the data format used in this machine learning study is a tabular format, likely stored in a CSV file.
