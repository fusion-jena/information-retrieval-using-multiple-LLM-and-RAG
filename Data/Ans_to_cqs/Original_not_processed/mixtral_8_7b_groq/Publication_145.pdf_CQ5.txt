Answer:::

The text provided does not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of high-resolution imagery for species distribution and the application of a deep learning method called U-net, but it does not specify the source of these images or whether they are part of a standard dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question based on the given context.
