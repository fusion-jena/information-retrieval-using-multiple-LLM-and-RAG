The provided context does not contain information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. Instead, it focuses on ensemble models and their performance in relation to the number of background points used during training.

The hyperparameters mentioned in the context are related to the number of background points used for training individual models and ensemble models. These include optimizing the number of background points for individual modeling approaches and testing ensemble models with four combinations of background points. The text highlights that the ensemble performed slightly better when all individual models used their optimal number of background points.

However, the context does not mention any deep learning model or its hyperparameters, such as learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given information.
