Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it is not possible to directly determine the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. This is because the context does not contain information about a deep learning model, but rather focuses on the use of the MaxEnt model in a ecological study.

However, we can infer some information about the overall modeling process that may have been used. For example, the study involved running the MaxEnt model with a subsampling approach and a 30% test percentage. The model's output was then analyzed to determine the relative contributions of various environmental and territorial variables.

Furthermore, the study used a set of temperature, precipitation, and geographical factors as inputs to the model. These factors include variables such as mean temperature of driest quarter, precipitation of wettest month, and slope.

While this information does not directly answer the query about deep learning hyperparameters, it does provide some insight into the overall modeling process and the types of inputs used. It is possible that a deep learning model was used in conjunction with the MaxEnt model or as a subsequent step in the analysis, but without further information, we cannot make any definitive conclusions.
