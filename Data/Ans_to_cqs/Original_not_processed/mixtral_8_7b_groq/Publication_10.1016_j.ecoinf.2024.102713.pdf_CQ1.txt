Answer:::

The text does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some of the data sources and types of data that are used in the pipeline.

The Raw tier of the data platform hosts the data lake, which stores raw data in its native format. This raw data comes from external sources and includes structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

One of the data sources mentioned is a "Monitoring network" which is likely to involve sensors or other types of monitoring devices that collect data about the environment. The text also mentions satellite images as a data source, which are likely collected using remote sensing technologies.

In addition to these sources, the text mentions that the Raw tier stores data collected from CASE, which is a system that appears to be based on questionnaires or surveys filled out by users. This suggests that survey data may also be used as a source of raw data in the pipeline.

Finally, the text mentions that the Raw tier stores data from public datasets, although it does not provide specific examples of what these datasets might be.

In summary, while the text does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data, it does mention several data sources that are likely to involve sensors, remote sensing, surveys, and public datasets.
