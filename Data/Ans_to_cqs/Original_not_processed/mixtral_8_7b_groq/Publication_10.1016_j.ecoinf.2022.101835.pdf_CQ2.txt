Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data used in this study is likely to be in a structured format such as CSV or a similar tabular format, since the models are built using daily average temperature data. The context also mentions the use of the LightGBM library, which is a gradient boosting framework that is designed to work with structured data. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the data used in this study is in a structured format. The context does not provide any information about the use of image, audio, or video data formats in the deep learning pipeline.
