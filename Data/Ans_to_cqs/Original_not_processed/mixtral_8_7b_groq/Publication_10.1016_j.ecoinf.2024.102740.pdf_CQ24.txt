Answer:::

The query asks about strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically mentioning the random seed value. However, the provided context does not contain direct information about deep learning pipelines and random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer based on the given context.

However, I can provide some general information about handling randomness in machine learning, which includes deep learning. In machine learning, randomness can be introduced through various processes, such as initializing weights in neural networks, selecting samples for training, or applying techniques like dropout. A random seed value is used to control the randomness in these processes, ensuring reproducibility of results.

In the context of random forests, a machine learning technique mentioned in some of the provided references, randomness is introduced by selecting a random subset of features at each node for splitting and growing trees. The random seed value is used to initialize the random number generator, which determines the randomness in feature selection. Probst et al., (2019) discuss hyperparameters and tuning strategies for random forests, including methods for handling randomness, such as setting the number of trees and the size of the random feature subset.

In remote sensing applications, such as those discussed in Raab et al., (2020), Ramoelo et al., (2015), Liu et al., (2017), Li et al., (2012, 2013), and Askari et al., (2019), random forests and other machine learning techniques are used to classify land cover, estimate biomass, and monitor grassland dynamics. These applications may also employ strategies to handle randomness, such as setting random seeds, to ensure reproducibility and stability of results.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not contain specific information about handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, it is common practice in machine learning to use a random seed value to control randomness in various processes. In the context of random forests, strategies for handling randomness include setting the number of trees and the size of the random feature subset. Remote sensing applications using machine learning techniques, such as random forests, may also employ strategies to handle randomness.
