Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct link to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline for harmful algal blooms (HABs) monitoring and prediction. However, the context mentions a study by Busari et al. (2024) that predicts chlorophyll-a as an indicator of HABs using deep learning with Bayesian approximation for uncertainty assessment. It is likely that the code repository for this study is available on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

To access the code repository, you can contact the authors of the study directly. The authors have acknowledged the Land Development Division of Greenville County for providing the datasets utilized in the study. Therefore, you can reach out to Greenville County or the Clemson University Experiment Station for further information.

Additionally, you can search for the authors' names on popular code repositories like GitHub or GitLab. If the code repository is public, you can access it directly. If it is private, you can request access from the authors.

It is also worth noting that the study by Busari et al. (2024) used a deep learning model with Bayesian approximation for uncertainty assessment. Therefore, the code repository may include implementations of Bayesian deep learning models.

In summary, while there is no direct link to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline for HABs monitoring and prediction, you can contact the authors or search for their names on popular code repositories to access the code. The code repository may include implementations of Bayesian deep learning models.
