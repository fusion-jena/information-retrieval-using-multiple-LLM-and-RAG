Answer:::

The text provided does not give detailed information on the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that once the network has processed a list of cropped thumbnails and their labels, it uses inception layers based on the GoogLeNet architecture. The inception layers allow for a reduction of the picture's dimension to one pixel, making the model not dependent on the dimensional impact. The network's parameters have been adapted to achieve better results than a classic architecture.

Additionally, the text describes the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for training. The CNN is given a database consisting of image-label couples, where the label is the fish species in this specific application. The CNN uses convolutional layers with kernels, an activation function, and a pooling phase to transform the signal from the previous layer and select significant pixels. The last convolutional layer concatenates all the information into one feature vector and sends it to another layer or a classifier.

However, the information on model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment steps is not provided in the text. Therefore, I cannot give a comprehensive answer to this query.
