Answer: The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are the ImageNet dataset, PAD Full, and PAD Lite datasets.

The ImageNet dataset is used to pre-train the model before fine-tuning it on the PAD Full and PAD Lite datasets. The ImageNet dataset is a large-scale image recognition dataset that contains over 14 million images belonging to 1000 classes. It has been widely used in the computer vision community for training and evaluating image classification models.

On the other hand, the PAD Full and PAD Lite datasets are used for fine-tuning the pre-trained model. These datasets are related to ecological informatics and are used for age estimation of wild animals. However, the specific details of these datasets, such as the number of images, classes, and animal species, are not provided in the given context.

It is worth noting that the authors used a five-fold subject-exclusive (SE) strategy to ensure that the same subject did not appear in the training set and testing set at the same time. This strategy helps to eliminate the influence of individuals and improve the generalization of the model.

Furthermore, the authors downscaled the resolution of all images to 224 Ã— 224 pixels before feeding them to the models. They also applied aggressive data augmentation to avoid overfitting and imbalanced problems.

Overall, the given context provides information on the deep learning pipeline used for age estimation of wild animals. However, it does not provide detailed information about the PAD Full and PAD Lite datasets.
