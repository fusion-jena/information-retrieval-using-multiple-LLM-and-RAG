Based on the provided context, the specific purpose of implementing a deep learning model for image recognition in this particular project is not explicitly stated. However, it is mentioned that the limited geographical area and the nature of the tweets, which often contain a low number of words and may not be well written, prevent the researchers from making major efforts in training an image recognition model. This suggests that an image recognition model, such as a deep learning model, could be used for classifying, segmenting, or detecting specific objects or organisms in images shared on Twitter.

The potential benefits of such a model are highlighted in the context, as it could help reduce human effort and provide useful information for biodiversity observations. The successful implementation of the current methodology, which involves searching tweets with specific criteria related to the discovery of interesting things, could be extended to larger areas and more languages with the help of a deep learning model. This is due to the subsequent increase in the volume of data that could be processed and analyzed.

In summary, while the specific purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that it would be used for image recognition tasks related to the classification, segmentation, or detection of objects or organisms in images shared on Twitter. The implementation of such a model could help reduce human effort, provide useful information for biodiversity observations, and extend the current methodology to larger areas and more languages.
