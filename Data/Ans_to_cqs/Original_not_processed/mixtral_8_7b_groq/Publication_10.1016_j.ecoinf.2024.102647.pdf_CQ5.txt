Based on the provided context, there is no specific mention of the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the described studies. Instead, the studies focus on using various datasets related to soil salinity, soil moisture, soil pH, topographic features, land use, land cover, and groundwater data.

In the study titled "An automated deep learning convolutional neural network algorithm applied for soil salinity distribution mapping in Lake Urmia, Iran" by Geng and Boufadel (2017), the authors used soil salinity data from Lake Urmia in Iran. Similarly, in the study by Ghazali et al. (2020), the authors used satellite imagery to generate soil salinity, soil moisture, and soil pH data.

In addition to soil salinity data, other studies have used topographic and land use data. For instance, Rahmati et al. (2019) used land subsidence data for land subsidence modeling using tree-based machine learning algorithms. Similarly, Razavi Termeh et al. (2017) used groundwater potential mapping data, including topographic wetness index, slope, curvature, and land use data.

Furthermore, some studies have used well data and groundwater data. For example, the study titled "Acknowledging the limitations imposed by data scarcity, our utilization of the available well data underscores our commitment to maximizing plain groundwater resources" by Al-Bakri et al. (2015) used well data to maximize plain groundwater resources. Similarly, Re and Sacchi (2017) used nitrate and boron isotopes data in coastal aquifers from arid regions to tackle the salinity-pollution nexus.

Therefore, while the provided context does not mention the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it shows that various datasets related to soil salinity, topographic features, land use, land cover, and groundwater data have been used in the deep learning pipelines in the studies.
