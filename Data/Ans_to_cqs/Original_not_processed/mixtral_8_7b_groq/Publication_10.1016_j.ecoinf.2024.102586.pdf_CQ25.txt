Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating that a deep learning model was used in the study. The study instead employed the Random Forest (RF) model, a machine learning technique, to examine the relative importance of selected environmental and anthropogenic variables on invasive plant species richness and abundance. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer regarding the purpose of a deep learning model in this context.
