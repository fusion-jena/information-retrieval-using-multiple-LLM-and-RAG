Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific criterion used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it is mentioned that the hyperparameter tuning was done for each training set, followed by model training using an optimal setting of the hyperparameter. Four regression models (AdaBoost, RF, NET, and Bayes) were used for modeling forest AGB.

Additionally, the study evaluated the models using several metrics, including RMSE, R2, cross-validation R2, and average angle deviation from the line 1:1 for test samples (AD\_test) and all samples (AD\_all). The difference between R2\_test and R2\_all (Diff\_R2) was also calculated.

Therefore, while the specific criterion for determining training completion is not mentioned, the study did use various evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the models. It is possible that the training was completed based on these evaluation metrics, such as achieving a desired RMSE or R2 value, or reaching a plateau in the cross-validation R2 score. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
