Based on the provided context, there is no information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text mainly discusses data repositories, particularly the ESS-DIVE repository, which stores data from research funded by the DOEâ€™s Biological and Environmental Research (BER) Environmental Systems Science (ESS) program. It mentions nothing about any code repository related to these projects.

The context does mention several US Department of Energy (DOE) projects, including the Environmental Systems Science Data Infrastructure for a Virtual Ecosystem (ESS-DIVE) data repository, the AmeriFlux carbon flux network, the Watershed Function Science Focus Area (WFSFA), and Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments - Tropics (NGEE-Tropics). However, it focuses on the data management and storage aspects of these projects, not on any code repositories.

Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline because it is not mentioned in the given context.
