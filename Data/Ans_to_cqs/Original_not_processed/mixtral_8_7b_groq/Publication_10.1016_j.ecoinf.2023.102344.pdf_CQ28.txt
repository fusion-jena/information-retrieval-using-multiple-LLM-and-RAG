The context provided does not give information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses various detection, classification, and tracking models, such as EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetv2, and InceptionV3, in the context of ecological informatics and traceability. It also explains some techniques used to improve the performance of these models, such as shortcut connections, skip connections, and global average pooling. However, it does not mention any cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform) that was used for deployment.
