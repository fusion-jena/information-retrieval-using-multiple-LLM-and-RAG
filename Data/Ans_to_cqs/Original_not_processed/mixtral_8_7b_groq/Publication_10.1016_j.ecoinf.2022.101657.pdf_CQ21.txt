After the model training, there are several postprocessing steps that can be involved, such as generating saliency maps, calculating various metrics, and creating a confusion matrix. However, the specific postprocessing steps mentioned in the provided context are metrics calculation and creating a confusion matrix.

In the context, it is mentioned that the official, MS-COCO pre-trained, version of the architecture was further trained using the WCS dataset and its recommended data split. After this transfer-learning, a credible mean average precision (mAP) score of 0.75 was achieved. The mAP metric takes the mean over all considered species of their respective, species-specific average precision. The subscript 50 refers to the requirement that the area of the intersection of ground truth bounding box and predicted bounding box needs to be at least 50% of the area of the union of both for an otherwise true species identification to be considered correct.

Additionally, a confusion matrix can be created to evaluate the performance of the model. A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model (or "classifier") on a set of test data for which the true values are known. It allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. It has four components: true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). These values are used to calculate additional metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.

It is important to note that in the provided context, there is no mention of generating saliency maps. Saliency maps are a graphical representation of the importance of each pixel in an image with respect to a particular task, such as object detection. Saliency maps can be used to help understand and interpret the predictions made by a deep learning model.

In summary, after training the model, postprocessing steps such as calculating metrics (mAP) and creating a confusion matrix are mentioned in the provided context. However, generating saliency maps is not mentioned.
