Based on the provided context, there is no specific information given about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The text mainly focuses on the overall system architecture of the PTDLEN-VAE model, the design of the IKHO algorithm for parameter optimization, and the comparison of the PTDLEN-VAE model's performance with other techniques.

However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated based on the classification outcomes analysis presented in Table 1 and Fig. 6. The analysis includes the evaluation of precision and recall of the PTDLEN-VAE model and other techniques. Precision is the measure of the correct positive predictions made by the model, while recall is the measure of the actual positive instances that the model correctly identified. These metrics provide insights into the model's performance, indicating how well the model is identifying relevant features and making accurate predictions.

Additionally, the IKHO algorithm is designed to optimize the hyperparameters of the EfficientNet model, which is used as a feature extractor in the PTDLEN-VAE model. The IKHO algorithm integrates the KH algorithm with a free search operator to avoid local optimal problems. This optimization process is likely to improve the model's performance during training.

In summary, while there is no explicit information provided about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, the analysis of precision and recall, along with the optimization of hyperparameters using the IKHO algorithm, provides insights into the model's performance.
