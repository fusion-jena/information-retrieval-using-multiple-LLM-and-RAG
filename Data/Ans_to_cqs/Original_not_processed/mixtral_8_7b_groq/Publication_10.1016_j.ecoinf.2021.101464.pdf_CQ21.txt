Based on the provided context, there are no specific details about postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating confusion matrices. However, the context does mention that they performed a 10-fold cross-validation using independent test data after training the Random Forest (RF) model. This step helps to evaluate the model's performance and stability.

In the context, they have presented the evaluation metrics, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R-squared (R2), for both the original RF model and its 10-fold cross-validation using independent test data. These metrics give an idea of the model's accuracy and goodness of fit.

To summarize, the postprocessing steps mentioned in the context are:

1. Model evaluation using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R-squared (R2).
2. Model stability assessment through 10-fold cross-validation using independent test data.

However, other common postprocessing steps, such as generating saliency maps or calculating additional metrics like precision, recall, and creating confusion matrices, are not mentioned in the provided context.
