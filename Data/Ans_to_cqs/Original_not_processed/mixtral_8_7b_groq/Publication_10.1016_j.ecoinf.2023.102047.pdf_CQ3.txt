In the context provided, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. This is used in the training and testing of the Faster R-CNN model for object detection.

In more detail, the images used in the study are first labeled using 'LabelImg' software under expert guidance. 'LabelImg' is a graphical image annotation tool written in Python, and it saves the labeled files in PASCAL VOC format as .xml files. A sample image labeled using the 'LabelImg' software is presented in Fig. 5. For the Faster R-CNN model, the datasets are then converted into 'TFRecords' file format, which is well-optimized for TensorFlow and internally uses protocol buffers to serialize and deserialize the data.

The Faster R-CNN model is a two-stage object detector, where the input images are fed into a CNN, which produces feature maps from the input images. A different neural network, RPN, is then applied to predict the candidate bounding boxes. RoI pooling layers are applied to reshape the inputs, and these properties render these two-stage detectors superior to one-stage detectors.

It is worth noting that while the context provided only mentions bounding box annotation, there are other data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. For instance, instance segmentation is a more fine-grained annotation technique where each instance of an object is segmented and labeled in the image. This technique provides more detailed information about the objects in the image, but it is also more time-consuming and labor-intensive than bounding box annotation.

In summary, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context provided is bounding box annotation, which is used for object detection in the Faster R-CNN model. Other data annotation techniques, such as instance segmentation, are also used in deep learning pipelines for more detailed object information.
