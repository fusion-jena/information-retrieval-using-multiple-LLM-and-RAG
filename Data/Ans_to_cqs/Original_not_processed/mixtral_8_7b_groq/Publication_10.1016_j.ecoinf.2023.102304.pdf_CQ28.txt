Answer:::

The information provided does not specify the exact platform used to deploy a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the data preparation and implementation of the Land Transformation Rate (LTR) algorithm, which is used to mask out cloud, shadow, and water bodies within multitemporal imagery, are run in the Google Earth Engine platform. It is important to note that the Google Earth Engine platform is a different service from the Google Cloud Platform and is primarily used for geospatial analysis and remote sensing applications. Therefore, while it is not explicitly stated, it is possible that the Google Earth Engine platform was used for the deployment of the deep learning model.
