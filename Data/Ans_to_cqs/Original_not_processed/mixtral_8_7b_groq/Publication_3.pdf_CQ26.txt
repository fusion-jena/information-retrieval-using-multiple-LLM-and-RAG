The provided context discusses a research study that uses deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and TensorFlow, for species identification through bioacoustic monitoring. However, the text does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

That being said, there are some implicit indications of data preprocessing methods that could potentially help mitigate data bias. For instance, the study used data from Cornell Universityâ€™s Laboratory of Ornithology and Macaulay Library of Natural Sounds, which suggests a diverse data collection. Additionally, the authors considered two factors, correct identification rate and processing time, when calibrating models for classification challenges. This implies that they might have employed techniques such as oversampling or undersampling to balance the dataset and improve model performance.

In general, addressing data bias in deep learning pipelines can involve several preprocessing techniques, including:

1. Stratified splitting: This method involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria (e.g., species or class labels) and then randomly splitting each subgroup to maintain the original distribution in both training and testing sets.
2. Oversampling: In cases where certain classes are underrepresented, oversampling can help balance the dataset by duplicating instances from the minority class.
3. Undersampling: Alternatively, undersampling can be used to balance the dataset by randomly removing instances from the majority class.
4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources, locations, and conditions can help ensure that the dataset is representative of the real-world scenarios and reduce potential biases.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, it is essential to consider data bias and employ appropriate preprocessing methods when working with deep learning pipelines.
