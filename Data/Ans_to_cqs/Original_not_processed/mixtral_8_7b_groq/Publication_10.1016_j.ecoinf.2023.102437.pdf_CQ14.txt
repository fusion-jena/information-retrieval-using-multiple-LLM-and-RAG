The provided context does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization methods.

However, the authors did compare the performance of different machine learning models, including Lasso, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Random Forest (RF), for predicting land cover/land use (LCLU) classification. They also implemented a pre-selection method using the Python function “SelectKBest” from the toolbox “Scikitlearn” to see if it had an impact on the predictive results.

The authors evaluated the performance of the models using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R-squared (R2) metrics. The LSTM and Lasso models exhibited the highest correlation coefficients, while the RF model had a fairly constant predictive performance, close to R2 = 0.6.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameter optimization methods used, it does provide insights into the predictive performance of different machine learning models for LCLU classification.
