The provided context does not contain information about the evaluation metrics used for a deep learning model. The tables and figures presented in the context evaluate the performance of object-oriented nearest neighbor and random forest classification methods for land cover classification. These methods are not deep learning models.

The evaluation metrics used for the classification methods include producer accuracy, user accuracy, overall accuracy, and Kappa. Producer accuracy measures how well the map agrees with the actual ground conditions, user accuracy measures how well the actual ground conditions are represented in the map, overall accuracy is the percentage of correctly classified pixels out of the total number of pixels, and Kappa is a statistical measure that compares the observed accuracy with the expected accuracy.

Therefore, I cannot answer the query about the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model as there is no information provided in the context about it.
