Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training typically include creating separate sets for training, validation, and testing. However, the specific criteria are not mentioned in the provided context. Here's a general explanation based on common practices in deep learning:

1. Training Set: This is the portion of the data used to train the model. The model learns patterns from this data and adjusts its parameters to minimize the difference between its predictions and the actual values.

2. Validation Set: This set is used during the training process to validate the model's performance and adjust the model's hyperparameters. The validation set helps to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.

3. Testing Set: After the training process is complete, the model's performance is evaluated on the testing set. This set is used to provide an unbiased estimate of how the model will perform on new, unseen data.

The specific split ratio can vary depending on the size and complexity of the dataset. A common practice is to use 60-70% of the data for training, 10-15% for validation, and 15-20% for testing. However, these ratios can be adjusted based on the specific requirements of the problem and the available data.

In the context of environmental sound classification, a study by Piczak (2015) used a split of 80% for training and 20% for testing. Similarly, Salamon and Bello (2016) used a 70-30% split for training and testing, respectively.

In the case of CNNFAST, a deep learning tool for bat acoustic signal detection, the authors do not mention specific data split criteria. However, they do emphasize the importance of using a large and diverse dataset for training the model.
