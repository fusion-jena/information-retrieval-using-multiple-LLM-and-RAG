Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of control mechanisms that prevent the optimization process from deviating from previous optimal solutions. This is achieved through the formulation of control mechanisms in Eqs. (6)-(8), which incorporate a form of memory of previous local optima over a certain number of epochs. The trade-off between long and short-term memory of losses and their corresponding optima helps the model to steer towards more global optima.

In addition, the clustering performance of the model is improved by including an additional loss term scaling term γ(t)ℒcls in Eq. (9). The value of γ is cycled between 0.01 and 2 to keep the contribution from ℒcls in a similar range as ℒrec and ℒreg. This allows for a more stable and consistent training process.

Furthermore, the performance of the model is compared to a non-adaptive VAE, and it is observed that the non-adaptive VAE is more cumbersome to train as the model collapses frequently during training. This suggests that the implemented strategy is effective in preventing the model from collapsing and improving the overall training process.

Lastly, the number of clusters is selected based on the reconstruction quality of a dataset recorded at a different location, which is gradually expanded until reconstructions are sufficiently good. The size of the bottleneck of the model (latent dimension) is limited to two for visualization purposes.

In conclusion, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of control mechanisms that prevent deviation from previous optimal solutions, the inclusion of an additional loss term scaling term to improve clustering performance, and the comparison of the model's performance to a non-adaptive VAE. Additionally, the number of clusters is selected based on the reconstruction quality of a dataset. These strategies help ensure a stable and consistent training process, leading to improved model performance.
