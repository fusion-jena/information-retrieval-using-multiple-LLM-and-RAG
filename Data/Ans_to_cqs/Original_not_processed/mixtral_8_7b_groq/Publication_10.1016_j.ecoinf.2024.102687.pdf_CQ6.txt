The provided context discusses the fine-tuning and comparative analysis of pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) backbones for a specific task, but it does not directly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it is important to note that these steps are typically carried out as part of the data preparation process before training a deep learning model.

In the context of computer vision tasks, data normalization is often performed by scaling pixel values to a range of [0, 1] or [-1, 1] to improve the model's convergence during training. Additionally, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and cropping are commonly applied to increase the size and diversity of the training set.

In the provided context, the authors mention the use of pretrained CNNs on the ImageNet dataset, which is a large and general dataset. However, they also suggest that using features extracted from models trained on smaller but more specific datasets, such as bird sound datasets, could lead to higher quality classification. This implies that the authors may have performed some form of data preprocessing specific to the Darksound dataset used in their experiments.

Furthermore, the authors mention fine-tuning the pretrained DenseNet on the Darksound dataset, which involves updating the pretrained model's weights to better fit the new dataset. This process typically requires preprocessing steps such as normalization and scaling to be consistent with those used during the initial training of the pretrained model.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, it is implied that such steps were taken as part of the data preparation process. These steps may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, and data augmentation, among others, and are crucial for ensuring the model's convergence and performance during training.
