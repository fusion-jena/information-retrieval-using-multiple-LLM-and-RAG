Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning models tested, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. However, it does mention that two object detection models, YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, were compared.

YOLOv5 has several pre-defined configurations that use different hyperparameters. These configurations include YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, and YOLOv5l, where "s", "m", and "l" stand for small, medium, and large, respectively. The choice of configuration can affect the model's speed and accuracy. Additionally, the context mentions a modified variant of YOLOv5 called TPH-YOLOv5, which uses a Transformer Prediction Head (TPH) to improve performance.

Faster R-CNN is a two-stage object detection model that first generates region proposals and then classifies those proposals. The specific hyperparameters used in the Faster R-CNN model tested are not provided in the context. However, common hyperparameters for Faster R-CNN include learning rate, momentum, weight decay, and the choice of optimizer.

Therefore, while the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning models tested are not specified in the given context, it is mentioned that two different models were compared, and each model has several configurations or hyperparameters that can be adjusted to optimize performance.
