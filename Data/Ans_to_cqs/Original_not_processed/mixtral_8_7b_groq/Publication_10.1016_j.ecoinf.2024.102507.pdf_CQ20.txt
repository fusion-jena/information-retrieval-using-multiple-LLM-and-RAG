Based on the information provided, the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model are not mentioned. However, it is suggested that memory capacity may be an issue when inputting sample images for bands with large dimensions (36 and 72 bands). To address this, the images were disassembled into single-band images using Python's Rasterio module, which reduced the hardware resources and computing time required for deep learning. This process is equivalent to flattening the thick convolution kernel. Therefore, it can be inferred that the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model include a computer with sufficient memory to handle the image data and a processing unit (CPU) capable of running the deep learning algorithm. Additionally, a GPU or TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) might have been used to accelerate the training process, but this is not explicitly stated in the context.
