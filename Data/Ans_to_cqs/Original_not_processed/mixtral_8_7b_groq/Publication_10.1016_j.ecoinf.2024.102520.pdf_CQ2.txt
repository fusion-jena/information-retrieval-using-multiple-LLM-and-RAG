Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in this specific study uses remote sensing image data in the form of Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands. These bands are of 30-m resolution and were accessed from Google Earth Engine (GEE) on April 21, 2023.

The image data underwent pre-processing, which included geometric, radiometric, and image mosaicking, and cropping. The Surface Reflectance (SR) was measured from the Digital Number (DN) of the original image. The Top of Atmosphere (TOA) and SR picture sets from Google Earth Engine (GEE) were used to expedite data processing.

The function ee.Image Collection in image preprocessing utilized the Landsat 8 SR images (High resolution satellite L2) from the GEE platform. Only the selected photos were reprocessed to perform de-clouding, mosaicking, and cropping.

Therefore, in this particular deep learning pipeline, the data format used is remote sensing image data. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the context provided.

Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline in this study uses remote sensing image data in the form of Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands, which were accessed from Google Earth Engine (GEE) and underwent pre-processing. Therefore, the data format used in this pipeline is remote sensing image data.
