Answer:::

The deep learning model for fish detection was trained on a Windows 10-based mobile laptop equipped with an Intel(R) i7-11800H CPU and a GeForce RTX3080 GPU with 16GB of video memory. This information indicates that the model training was primarily performed using the GPU, which is a common practice in deep learning due to the high computational power and parallel processing capabilities of GPUs. The use of GPUs significantly accelerates the training process compared to using CPUs alone. The specific GPU model used in this study, the GeForce RTX3080, is known for its high performance and large video memory, making it suitable for handling complex deep learning tasks and large datasets. No mention was made of the use of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), which are custom-built hardware accelerators designed specifically for machine learning tasks and developed by Google. Thus, based on the information provided, the deep learning model for fish detection was trained using a GPU (GeForce RTX3080).
