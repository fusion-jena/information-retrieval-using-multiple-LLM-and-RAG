The provided pieces of context do not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, they do discuss the use of machine learning techniques in species distribution modeling and metapopulation dynamics.

In the context of species distribution modeling, the studies use seven different machine learning models, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART). These models are used to assess the impact of urban development on species distribution by extracting the Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for each model before and after urban development. Although the studies do not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, it is a common practice in machine learning to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility and handle randomness in the pipeline.

In the context of metapopulation dynamics, Moilanen and Hanski (1998) discuss the effects of habitat quality and landscape structure on metapopulation dynamics. Although this study does not directly discuss deep learning or machine learning techniques, it highlights the importance of handling randomness and uncertainty in ecological modeling. In the context of environmental impact assessment, Tarabon et al. (2019) discuss the use of species distribution and habitat connectivity modeling to improve the assessment of development projects' environmental impact. Again, while this study does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, it emphasizes the importance of handling uncertainty in ecological modeling.

Therefore, while the provided pieces of context do not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is a common practice in machine learning to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility and handle randomness in the pipeline. Additionally, handling randomness and uncertainty is an important consideration in ecological modeling, as highlighted in the studies discussing species distribution modeling and metapopulation dynamics.
