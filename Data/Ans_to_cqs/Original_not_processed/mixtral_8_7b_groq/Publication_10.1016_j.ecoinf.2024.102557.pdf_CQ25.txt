Based on the provided context, the specific purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for applications in ecology, such as species distribution, identification, land use change characterization, conservation, estimation, and invasive species risk assessment.

Deep learning models can be used for various tasks, including classification, segmentation, and object detection. In the context of ecology, deep learning models are often used for classification tasks, such as species identification through imagery (Gao et al., 2024). These models can learn complex features and patterns from large datasets, making them well-suited for identifying species in images or other types of data.

Deep learning models can also be used for segmentation tasks, which involve dividing an image or other type of data into distinct regions or segments. In ecology, segmentation can be used for land use change characterization (Gelabert et al., 2021), where different land use types are segmented and analyzed.

Finally, deep learning models can be used for object detection tasks, such as identifying and locating specific objects or features in an image or other type of data. In ecology, object detection can be used for identifying conservable or restorable areas (Cheng et al., 2018), where specific features or objects are detected and used to identify areas that are suitable for conservation or restoration.

Overall, the purpose of the deep learning model in ecology is to improve the accuracy of results compared to traditional modeling techniques by approximating non-linear relationships and considering a large number of predictors. The specific task that the deep learning model is used for (classification, segmentation, or detection) depends on the specific application and the type of data being analyzed.
