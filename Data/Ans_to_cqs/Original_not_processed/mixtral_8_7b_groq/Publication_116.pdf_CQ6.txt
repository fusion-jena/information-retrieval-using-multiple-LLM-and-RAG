Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are no explicit mentions of preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, we can infer some preprocessing steps from the description of the experiments.

The experiments involve training a deep learning model on herbarium specimen images of Bauhinia purpurea leaf samples. The model is a modified version of GoogleNet architecture [31] with Batch Normalization [32]. The authors used a batch size of 24 images for each iteration, with a learning rate of 0.0075, and images of 224 × 224 resolution. They also used simple crop and resize data augmentation with the default settings of Caffe [34].

Therefore, we can infer that the following preprocessing steps were involved:

1. Image resizing: The images were resized to 224 × 224 resolution.
2. Data augmentation: Simple crop and resize data augmentation was used with the default settings of Caffe.

However, there is no explicit mention of normalization, scaling, or cleaning. It is possible that these steps were performed but not mentioned in the provided context. In general, data preprocessing for deep learning models can include various steps such as:

1. Normalization: Scaling the input features to a similar range to avoid any feature dominating the learning process.
2. Scaling: Changing the range of features to improve learning.
3. Cleaning: Removing noise, outliers, or missing values from the data.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention these preprocessing steps, they are commonly used in deep learning and may have been applied in this case.
