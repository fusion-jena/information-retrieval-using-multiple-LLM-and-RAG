Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training of the MaxEnt model is complete. However, it does mention that the analysis is based on the subsample run type with a 30% random test percentage and averages of 10 replicate runs.

In the context, the MaxEnt model's output is analyzed to estimate the relative contributions of environmental and territorial variables. Two methods are used to determine the importance of each variable: percent contribution and permutation importance. The percent contribution is determined by the increase in regularized gain added to the contribution of the corresponding variable in each iteration of the training algorithm. Permutation importance shows the values of that variable on training presence, and background data are randomly permuted. The model is then reevaluated on the permuted data, and the resulting drop in training AUC is shown, normalized to percentages.

The variables used in the model include temperature factors such as bio4 (temperature seasonality), bio8 (mean temperature of wettest quarter), and bio9 (mean temperature of driest quarter). Precipitation factors include bio13 (precipitation of wettest month) and bio19 (precipitation of coldest quarter). Geographical factors include slope, which is expressed in % values of the Iberian Peninsula.

While the provided context does not specify the criteria used to determine when training is complete, it does provide insight into the methods used to analyze the MaxEnt model's output and estimate the relative contributions of environmental and territorial variables. These methods can be useful in understanding the importance of different variables in predicting the distribution of species.
