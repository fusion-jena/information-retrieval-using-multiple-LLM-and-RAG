The provided context does not include information about the deep learning pipeline or any data annotation techniques used in it. The text focuses on data collection and processing related to carbon sources and sinks, as well as the authorship contribution statement and data availability for a specific study.

Data annotation techniques are essential for training deep learning models, especially in computer vision tasks. Some common data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding box annotation: Drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in images. This technique is useful for object detection tasks.
2. Instance segmentation: Labeling each pixel of an object in an image, distinguishing it from other objects and the background. This technique is helpful for semantic segmentation tasks.
3. Semantic segmentation: Assigning a class label to each pixel in an image, grouping similar objects and distinguishing them from other classes.
4. Class labeling: Assigning a class label to an entire image, useful for image classification tasks.
5. Key-point annotation: Identifying and labeling key points or landmarks on objects within images, useful for pose estimation tasks.

These techniques help create labeled datasets that can be used to train deep learning models. However, the provided context does not mention any of these annotation methods.
