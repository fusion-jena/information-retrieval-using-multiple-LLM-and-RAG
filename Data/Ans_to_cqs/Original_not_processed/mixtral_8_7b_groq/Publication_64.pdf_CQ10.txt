Answer:::
The code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study discussed in the provided text is available on GitHub. It can be accessed using the following link: github.com/IgnacioHeredia/plant-classification. This was determined by looking for a code repository link in the text, which was mentioned in the first line as "Code is available at github.com/IgnacioHeredia/plant-classification".

The study presents a deep learning pipeline for large-scale plant classification using ResNet50 architecture. The pipeline outperforms the most widely used online public plant classification algorithm by a significant margin. The pipeline is evaluated on three test datasets, including Google Image Search, Portuguese Flora, and iNaturalist. The pipeline uses random ten crop testing with smaller data augmentation parameters than those used during training.

The study also highlights the potential benefits of using this deep learning pipeline for large-scale biodiversity projects, such as the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and LifeWatch. The pipeline can help build a fast and reliable method for automatically monitoring biodiversity, opening the field to active contributions from non-expert users, including citizen scientists.

In summary, the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study is available on GitHub at github.com/IgnacioHeredia/plant-classification.
