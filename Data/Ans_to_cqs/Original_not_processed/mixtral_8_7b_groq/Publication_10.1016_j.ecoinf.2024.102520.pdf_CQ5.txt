Based on the provided context, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the study used remote sensing image data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) as one of the primary datasets. Specifically, Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands (Band 4, 3, and 2) of 30-m resolution were used in the study. Additionally, the study used Digital Number (DN) provided by the original image, which was processed to obtain the Measured Surface Reflectance (SR).

Furthermore, the study conducted Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) studies based on Geographic Information System (GIS), which revealed that agricultural (30%), horticultural (40%), and forest land (about 16%) uses account for >86% of the total area of the region studied. The remaining area includes wastelands, ravine streams, and urbanized sites. The native vegetation in the region includes Pinus spp., Fir spp., Citrus spp., Salix spp., Populus spp., and Ulmus spp..

However, it is important to note that the context does not mention any standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Therefore, it can be concluded that the study used custom remote sensing image data for their deep learning pipeline.
