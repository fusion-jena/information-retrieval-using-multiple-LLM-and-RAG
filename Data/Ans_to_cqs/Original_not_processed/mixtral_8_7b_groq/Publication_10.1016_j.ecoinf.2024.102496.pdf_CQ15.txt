Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text mainly discusses a tool for identifying locations for implementing Best Management Practices (BMPs) to reduce pollutant loads in water bodies.

However, it does mention that the tool uses various features such as search bars, filtering metrics, addition of online data, selection of different basemaps, and selection of a specific region. But these features are related to the functionality of the tool and not about the optimization techniques in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide information on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
