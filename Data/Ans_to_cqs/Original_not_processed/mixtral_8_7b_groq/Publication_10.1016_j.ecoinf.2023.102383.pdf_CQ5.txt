Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipelines for animal recognition and counting. However, it does mention several papers and sources that use deep learning models for object detection and small object detection, such as YOLOv4, R-CNN, and ResNet.

YOLOv4, as described in the Bochkovskiy et al. (2020) paper, is a state-of-the-art object detection system that uses a deep learning model. While the paper does not specify the dataset used for training, it is likely that a large-scale dataset was used, such as COCO or PASCAL VOC, which are commonly used for object detection tasks.

The R-CNN paper by Chen et al. (2017) focuses on small object detection and uses the PASCAL VOC dataset for training and evaluation. The PASCAL VOC dataset is a popular benchmark for object detection and segmentation tasks and contains images of 20 object categories.

The FRC_ResNet models mentioned in the context are likely to be trained on a dataset specific to animal recognition and counting. However, the exact dataset is not mentioned.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the datasets used for animal recognition and counting, it does mention several papers and models that use large-scale datasets for object detection tasks. Additionally, it is likely that a dataset specific to animal recognition and counting was used for training the FRC_ResNet models.
