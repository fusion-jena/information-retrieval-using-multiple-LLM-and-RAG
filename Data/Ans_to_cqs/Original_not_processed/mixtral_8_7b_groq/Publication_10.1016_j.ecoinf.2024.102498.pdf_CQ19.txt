The context does not provide specific information about the deep learning framework used to build the model. However, it is mentioned that deep learning techniques are integrated with the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform through the Google Cloud platform. Common deep learning frameworks that can be used with the Google Cloud platform include TensorFlow and PyTorch. TensorFlow is a popular open-source library for numerical computation, which provides robust support for deep learning and is widely used in research and industry. PyTorch is another open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, which is known for its simplicity and ease of use, as well as its seamless transition between CPUs and GPUs. Therefore, it is possible that either TensorFlow or PyTorch was used to build the deep learning model, but the context does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion.
