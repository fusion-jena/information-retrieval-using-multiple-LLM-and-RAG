Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, we can infer some steps that might have been taken based on common deep learning practices.

First, the model would have been trained using a suitable deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The training process would have involved feeding the model the labeled satellite images of the Brazilian Savanna physiognomies, along with their corresponding labels. The model would have learned to classify these images based on the spectral behavior of the physiognomies and their respective major groups, which rely on the information contained in different wavelengths represented by the satellite spectral bands.

Once the model was trained, it would have been evaluated using a separate validation dataset to estimate its accuracy metrics. After achieving satisfactory performance, the model would have been serialized, which involves saving the model's architecture, weights, and other relevant information in a file format that can be later loaded and used for inference.

The serialized model could then be deployed on a suitable platform for real-world use. This platform could be a cloud-based service, such as Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services, or a local server or workstation. The choice of platform would depend on various factors, such as the required computational resources, data privacy concerns, and cost considerations.

To use the model for inference, a sliding window approach would have been employed to classify the satellite images. This approach involves dividing the image into smaller overlapping regions, or "sliding windows," and feeding each window into the model for classification. The final Cerrado physiognomies map would have been generated by combining the classification results of all sliding windows.

Overall, while the context does not provide explicit information on the deployment process, it is likely that the trained deep learning model was serialized and deployed on a suitable platform for real-world use, and a sliding window approach was employed for image classification.
