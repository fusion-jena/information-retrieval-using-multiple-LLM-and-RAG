Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or any code repository link related to it. The text discusses the use of machine learning methods for image classification, but it does not mention any specific implementation or code repository. Furthermore, it also discusses the challenges and limitations of using machine learning methods for historical imagery analysis.

Therefore, I am unable to provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline as it was not mentioned in the given context.
