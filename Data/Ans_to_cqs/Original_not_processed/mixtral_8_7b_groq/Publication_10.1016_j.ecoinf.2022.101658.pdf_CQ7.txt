Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the data was split into training and testing sets, with an additional independent validation set.

The training and testing sets were created using data collected at Pelican Mountain (PM) and Calling Lake (CL) field sites. Specifically, manual classification of fuel types used in semantic segmentation training and testing were limited to data collected at PM and CL. On the other hand, field measurement data and raw photos from the Conklin (CK) field site were used solely for independent validation.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the data from PM and CL were used for training and testing the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) semantic segmentation algorithm, while the data from CK was used for independent validation. However, the specific criteria or ratio used for splitting the data into training and testing sets is not provided.
