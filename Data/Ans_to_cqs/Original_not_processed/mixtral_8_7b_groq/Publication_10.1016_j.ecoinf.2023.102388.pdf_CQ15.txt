Answer:::

In the deep learning pipelines described in the provided context, several optimization techniques are applied.

In the context of no-overfitting, the optimization algorithm used for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The learning rate for this SGD is set to 0.0001, and a weight decay of 0.5 is applied. The batch size is set to 32, and the number of training epochs is 200. Additionally, batch normalization and dropout techniques are used to reduce the overfitting level.

In the overfitting scenario, the same hyperparameters setting as the no-overfitting scenario is used, but the batch-norm, weight decay, and dropout techniques are removed to ensure that the model overfits.

In the scenario of strengthening the ability of trained models to generalize effectively, SGD with a momentum of 0.9 is used. The learning rate is set to 0.001, the batch size to 32, and a decay of 0.5 is applied every 512 iterations, summing up to a total of 2048 iterations.

In the context of the Siamese Neural Network (SNN) and Ensemble MIA approaches for the GREMM dataset, the optimization algorithm used to train CNNs is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), with a learning rate of 0.0001, a batch size set to 32, and the number of training epochs set to 200.

In summary, the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipelines described in the provided context are Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with various learning rates, momentum, weight decay, batch size, number of training epochs, and techniques to reduce overfitting like batch normalization and dropout.
