Answer:::
The metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in the provided context is top-1 accuracy. This is specified in Table 2, where the "Top-1 accuracy, %" column shows the performance of each model in detecting images that contain animals.

The top-1 accuracy is a common metric used in image classification tasks. It measures the percentage of images for which the model's predicted class matches the actual class, out of all images. In other words, it's the proportion of correct predictions made by the model when it's allowed to give only one answer.

It's important to note that other metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, etc., are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. These metrics can provide additional insights into the model's performance, especially in imbalanced datasets. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

In summary, the top-1 accuracy metric is used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in the provided context. However, other metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score can also be important to assess the model's performance in different scenarios.
