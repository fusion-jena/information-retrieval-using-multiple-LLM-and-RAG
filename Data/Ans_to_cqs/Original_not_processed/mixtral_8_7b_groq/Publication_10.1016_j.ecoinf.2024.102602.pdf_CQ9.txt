Answer:::
The data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available on Zenodo. The dataset, which includes 3274 images and their associated metadata, was collected by ASC in 2023 and can be accessed using the following DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.8348734. The data was collected and prepared for analysis by resizing the images to a resolution of 227x197 pixels and normalizing them to the [0,1] range. Six open-source Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were then selected for model optimization, including VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0. The Adam optimizer algorithm was used for model optimization, with a batch size of 10 and 100 epochs. The learning rates were chosen based on empirical trials over 100 epochs.

An additional resource for the deep learning pipeline is the CRediT authorship contribution statement, which provides information on the contributions made by the authors of the study. The study also addresses any biases or ethical concerns associated with deep learning applications and the use of personal data.

In summary, the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available on Zenodo, and can be accessed using the provided DOI. The dataset includes 3274 images and their associated metadata, and was prepared for analysis using open-source CNNs and the Adam optimizer algorithm. The study also includes a CRediT authorship contribution statement and addresses any biases or ethical concerns associated with the use of personal data.
