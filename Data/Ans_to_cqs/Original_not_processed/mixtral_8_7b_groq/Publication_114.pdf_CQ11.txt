Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context consists of a figure illustrating the workflow for identifying tree species using deep learning approaches, a table presenting the classification accuracies of three deep learning algorithms, and a brief description of the study's results. However, there is no information on where the data or code for the deep learning pipeline can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
