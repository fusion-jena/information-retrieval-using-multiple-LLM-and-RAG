The provided pieces of context do not directly discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention several sources of data that could be used as inputs for such a pipeline.

Answer:::
The sources of data mentioned in the context include remote sensing data, nighttime light imagery, and various bioclimate and geographical environment factors. Remote sensing data can be collected using sensors mounted on satellites or aircraft. Nighttime light imagery can also be collected using satellite-mounted sensors. Bioclimate and geographical environment factors could be obtained from public datasets or through surveys and measurements taken in the field.

Answer:::
In addition, some of the papers mentioned in the context discuss the use of human spread factors and variable classification methods. Human spread factors could be collected through surveys or other forms of data collection that involve human participants. Variable classification methods, on the other hand, are a type of data processing technique used to categorize and analyze data, rather than a method for collecting raw data.

Answer:::
Overall, while the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, it suggests that sensors, surveys, and public datasets are all potential sources of raw data for a deep learning pipeline. The specific methods used would depend on the type of data being collected and the research question being addressed.
