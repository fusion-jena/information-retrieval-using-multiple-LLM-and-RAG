Answer:::
I don't have enough information to provide the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model because the context provided does not include any details about the deep learning model or its configuration. The context mainly focuses on marine fish species data, species representativeness analysis (SRI), and bioregions.

However, I can provide some general guidance on typical deep learning model hyperparameters. Common hyperparameters include:

1. Learning rate: The step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function.
2. Optimizer: An algorithm used to update the weights and biases in the model based on the gradient of the loss function. Examples include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam.
3. Number of layers and neurons: The architecture of the neural network, including the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each layer.
4. Activation functions: Functions applied to the output of each neuron, such as ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), sigmoid, or tanh.
5. Batch size: The number of samples processed before the model's weights are updated.
6. Regularization techniques: Methods to prevent overfitting, such as L1, L2, or dropout.
7. Number of epochs: The number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.

To determine the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, one would typically refer to the model configuration or training code provided by the authors or developers.
