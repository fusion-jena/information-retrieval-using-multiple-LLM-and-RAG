Answer:::
The pieces of context provided do not explicitly mention the deep learning framework used to build the models. However, they do refer to several models and libraries that are compatible with the TensorFlow framework.

For instance, the VGG16 and ResNet152V2 models are referred to, which are part of TensorFlow's keras.applications module. Additionally, the use of TensorFlow Hub to access pre-trained models like VGGish and Yamnet suggests that the models are built using TensorFlow.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly state the deep learning framework used, it is strongly implied that TensorFlow is used to build the deep learning models.
