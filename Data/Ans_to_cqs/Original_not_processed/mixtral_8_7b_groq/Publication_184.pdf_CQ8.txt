Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context mainly focuses on the use of the YOLOv3 algorithm for fish detection in underwater images and videos, as well as the details of the training process and hyperparameters used. However, it does not mention where the code for this pipeline is located. Therefore, I am unable to provide the location of the code repository based on the given information.
