The provided context discusses the evaluation of various algorithms, including some that may be considered "deep learning" models, but it does not explicitly specify the metrics used to evaluate a deep learning model. However, it does provide information on several metrics used to evaluate the performance of different algorithms in predicting temperature.

The metrics provided in the context include:

1. Pbias: a percentage bias score, where positive values indicate underestimation and negative values indicate overestimation.
2. MAE: Mean Absolute Error, which measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.
3. RMSE: Root Mean Square Error, which is similar to MAE but gives more weight to larger errors.

The context states that "Percent biases were always remarkably close to zero, with little differences between algorithms," indicating that the models were generally unbiased in their predictions. It also mentions that "MAE and RMSE increased for all the algorithms during the hot season, although both metrics showed limited variability (0.4â€“1.3 
C;  Fig.  A.10c  and  Fig.  A.10d  in  Appendices)," indicating that the models' performance decreased during the hot season.

Therefore, while the context does not provide information on the specific metrics used to evaluate a deep learning model, it does provide information on several metrics used to evaluate temperature prediction algorithms, which may include deep learning models. These metrics include Pbias, MAE, and RMSE, and they provide information on the models' bias, accuracy, and error magnitude, respectively.
