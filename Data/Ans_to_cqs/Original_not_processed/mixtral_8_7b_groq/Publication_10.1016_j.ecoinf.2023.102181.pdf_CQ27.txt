Based on the provided context, there is no information about the training and deployment of a deep learning model. The text discusses the challenge of minimizing biased training of machine learning models with clustered data, specifically using covariance-weighted bagging. It also explains a process of repeating the modeling and prediction for each simulated sample point, generating an empirical semivariogram, fitting a semivariogram model, and simulating Gaussian random fields. However, this process pertains to a different methodology and does not include the training and deployment of a deep learning model.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context. Apologies for any inconvenience.
