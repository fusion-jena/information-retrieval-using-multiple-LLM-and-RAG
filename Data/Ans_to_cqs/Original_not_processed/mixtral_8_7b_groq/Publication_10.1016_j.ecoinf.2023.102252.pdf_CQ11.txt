Answer:::
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context mainly discusses a model related to environmental flow, riparian ecosystem, wetland, and biodiversity maintenance, with a focus on drought and dry spell duration. There is no mention of any deep learning pipeline or data repository link in the text. I hope this information is helpful.
