Answer:

The strategy to monitor the model performance during training in the context provided is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated by comparing its classification results with the target PSI. The target PSI, which has the same format as the trained PSI, is classified using the trained model. If the satellite imagery accumulates due to continuous satellite observations, the PSI can be continuously generated, and classification can be continued using the model. This enables PCF land monitoring and implies that the model's performance is continuously monitored during operation.

Additionally, it is expected that the multi-year classification performance will be improved by learning classification results and incorporating them into the model. This suggests a strategy of using past classification results to iteratively improve the model's performance. However, this strategy does not directly pertain to monitoring the model's performance during training.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit details about the strategy to monitor the model's performance during training, it can be inferred that the model's performance is continuously monitored during operation by comparing its classification results with the target PSI. Furthermore, a strategy of using past classification results to iteratively improve the model's performance is suggested.
