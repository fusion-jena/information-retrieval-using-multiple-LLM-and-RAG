Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is for cetacean vocalization detection. This is a detection task, where the model is trained to identify and locate the presence of cetacean vocalizations in underwater recordings. The model is designed to address the challenges associated with the scarcity of ground truth data in underwater Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) studies by leveraging multi-annotation campaigns involving both expert and novice annotators. The deep learning model is trained on annotations from both novices and experts, with the aim of optimizing the potential of multi-annotation and mitigating the presence of noisy labels. The two proposed annotation aggregation methods, majority voting and soft labeling, are used to improve model performance and reduce variability, particularly when a sufficient number of annotators are involved. The results suggest that instructing annotators to adopt a more conservative approach could be beneficial, as simple convolutional neural network models generalize better from the most obvious examples and the introduction of false positives deteriorates the performance more than the omission of a vocalization in the annotation set. Furthermore, the models are evaluated on datasets different from the one used for training, in terms of recording devices, geographical areas, and the annotator that produced the annotation for pseudo-ground truth. The performances of these models are assessed by taking into account the agreement between the annotations of novices and those of the expert.
