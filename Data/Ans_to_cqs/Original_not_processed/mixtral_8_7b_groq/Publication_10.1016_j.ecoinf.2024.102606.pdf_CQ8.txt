Answer:::

Based on the information provided, there is no mention of a specific code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. The text focuses on the methodology, hypotheses, and results of the research, but it does not include any details about the availability of the code.

It is common for researchers to share their code and data to promote transparency and reproducibility, but it is not always required or possible. In this case, the authors may have chosen not to share the code publicly, or they might be planning to do so in the future.

If you are interested in accessing the code, I would recommend contacting the authors directly. They may be willing to share their code with you, or they might be able to provide more information about its availability.

Here is the citation for the study, which includes the authors' names and affiliations:

"Deep Learning for Automated Identification of Collembola in Agricultural Soils: A Proof of Concept" by J. Leclerc, A. Mouret, and J. Gauduchon.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
