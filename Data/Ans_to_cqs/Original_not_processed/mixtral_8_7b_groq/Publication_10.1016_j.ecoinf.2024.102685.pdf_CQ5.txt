Based on the provided context, the study does not involve a deep learning pipeline using standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the study focuses on mapping seagrass meadows in the Grado and Marano lagoon (Northeast Italy) using seasonal multispectral images from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and 8 Operational Land Imager satellites. The images cover a time period from 1999 to 2019, and the study aims to classify seagrass communities and species using a Random Forest machine learning algorithm.

Therefore, the datasets used in this study are specific to the seagrass meadows in the Grado and Marano lagoon, and not one of the standard deep learning datasets.
