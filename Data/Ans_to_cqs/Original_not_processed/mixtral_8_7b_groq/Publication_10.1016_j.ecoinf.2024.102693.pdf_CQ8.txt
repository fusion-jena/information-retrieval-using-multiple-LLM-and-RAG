Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various models such as CNN, Transformer-like models, and specific models like ViT, ResNet, and Volo, along with their features and performance. However, it does not mention where the code for these models or the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.
