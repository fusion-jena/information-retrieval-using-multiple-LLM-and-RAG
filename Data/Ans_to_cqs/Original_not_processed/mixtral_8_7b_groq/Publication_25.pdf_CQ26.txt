Answer:::

The provided context discusses techniques used to address the lack of training data in deep learning for remote sensing applications, particularly for tree detection. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific preprocessing techniques for addressing data bias such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique used to ensure that each subset (e.g., training, validation, testing) of the data is representative of the original dataset's distribution. Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance the class distribution in the dataset. Diverse data collection refers to the process of gathering data from various sources or under different conditions to ensure that the dataset is representative of the target population.

The context does mention the use of "self-supervised learning" (Wu et al., 2018) and "unsupervised pre-training" (Erhan et al., 2009) as approaches to address the data limitation in deep learning. Self-supervised learning uses unsupervised methods to generate training data that is then used to train supervised models. Unsupervised pre-training involves training a deep learning model on an unlabeled dataset before fine-tuning it on a labeled dataset. These techniques can help reduce the dependence on labeled data and improve the model's generalization performance.

In the context of tree detection, the authors mention the use of labeled data combined with unsupervised tree delimitation approaches for initial model training. However, it is unclear whether moderate to low-quality annotations can be used for this purpose due to the imperfect nature of existing unsupervised tree delimitation methods.

In summary, while the provided context discusses techniques for addressing the lack of training data in deep learning, it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing techniques for addressing data bias such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
