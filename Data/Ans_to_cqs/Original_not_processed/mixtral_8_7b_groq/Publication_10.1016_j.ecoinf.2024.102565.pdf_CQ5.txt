Answer:::
In the provided pieces of context, there are no specific mentions of the commonly used datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipeline. However, some studies mentioned using Landsat 8 data, Sentinel-2 images, and geostationary satellite ocean color data for their respective research.

Hanintyo et al., 2021, utilized Landsat 8 data over Wangi-Wangi Island, Indonesia for chlorophyll-a and total suspended matter retrieval. Similarly, Peterson et al., 2020, used Landsat-8/Sentinel-2 virtual constellation data for deep learning-based water quality estimation and anomaly detection. Noori et al., 2024, employed Sentinel-2 images for water body extraction. Additionally, Poormorteza et al., 2023, used UAV images for high-resolution, spatially resolved quantification of wind erosion rates. Psychalas et al., 2023, focused on mapping muddy waters with Sentinel-2 using machine learning.

In summary, the provided context does not explicitly mention the commonly used deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, various studies have used Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and UAV images for their research purposes.
