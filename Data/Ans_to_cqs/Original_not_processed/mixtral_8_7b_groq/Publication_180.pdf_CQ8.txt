Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the specific location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this project. The text only mentions that TensorFlow, an open-source software platform, was adapted and configured for their project using Python. However, it does not specify where the code is hosted.

It is common for researchers to share their code and data through repositories like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket to promote transparency and reproducibility. However, in this case, the context does not provide enough information to determine the exact location of the code repository.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
