Answer:::

The provided context does not contain specific information on the optimization of hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search. However, it does mention several models and methods used in environmental and ecological studies.

In the study "Habitat quality assessment of mining cities based on InVEST model - a case study of Yanshan County, Jiangxi Province" (Li et al., 2022), the InVEST model is used to assess habitat quality. However, the context does not mention how the hyperparameters of this model are optimized.

The study "A spatial Bayesian-network approach as a decision-making tool for ecological-risk prevention in land ecosystems" (Guo et al., 2020) uses a spatial Bayesian network approach. While the paper discusses the model's structure and application, it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization.

Guo et al. (2021a) propose an optimization framework for landscape spatial structure, but the context does not mention the specific methods used for hyperparameter optimization.

In "Effects of landscape patterns on runoff and sediment in Danjiang River Basin" (Guo et al., 2021), the authors analyze the impact of landscape patterns on runoff and sediment. However, the optimization of hyperparameters is not discussed.

Malekmohammadi and Blouchi (2014) use a multi-criteria decision-making approach for ecological risk assessment. While they describe the decision-making process, the context does not mention hyperparameter optimization methods.

Manning (2019), Margules and Pressey (2000), and Moilanen (2007) discuss broader topics related to ecological planning and conservation, but do not provide specific information on hyperparameter optimization.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the optimization of hyperparameters.
