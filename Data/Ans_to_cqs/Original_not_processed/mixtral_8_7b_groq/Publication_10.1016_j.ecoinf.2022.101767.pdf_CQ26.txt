Answer:::

The provided context does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a wrapper feature selection algorithm working with random forest analysis to identify important factors in a dataset. This technique can help reduce bias by ensuring that all relevant features are considered in the analysis.

In the context of deep learning, there are several techniques commonly used to address data bias during preprocessing. These include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria (such as class labels) and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to create the training and testing sets. This helps ensure that each set is representative of the overall dataset and reduces bias.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances in a minority class to balance the dataset. This can help reduce bias by ensuring that the model is trained on a sufficient number of instances from each class.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances in a majority class to balance the dataset. This can help reduce bias by ensuring that the model is not overfitting to the majority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help reduce bias by ensuring that the model is trained on a diverse set of instances.

It is important to note that while these techniques can help reduce bias, they are not a substitute for careful consideration of the data collection and preprocessing process. Researchers should strive to collect diverse and representative datasets and to carefully evaluate the potential for bias at each stage of the process.
