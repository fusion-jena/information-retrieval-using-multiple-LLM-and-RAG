Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the study used Landsat images and phenological data as input to the deep learning model. It can be inferred that some common preprocessing steps for Landsat images might have been applied, such as:

1. Atmospheric correction: This step is used to minimize the effects of the atmosphere on the image, which can affect the accuracy of the classification.

2. Radiometric calibration: This step is used to convert the digital numbers in the image to at-sensor radiance or reflectance values.

3. Geometric correction: This step is used to correct the geometric distortions in the image, such as those caused by the sensor's viewing geometry and Earth's curvature.

Moreover, the study mentions the use of Phenological data (Ppf-CM) as input to the deep learning model. Phenological data refers to the study of periodic plant life cycle events, such as germination, flowering, and fruiting. It can be inferred that the phenological data was preprocessed to extract the relevant features for the study.

Furthermore, the context also suggests that the study used Spectral data, specifically capturing the three stages of paddy rice (sowing, green, and bare soil) to enhance the spectral separability between paddy rice and others. This implies that the spectral bands of the Landsat images might have been used as input to the deep learning model, and some preprocessing steps such as band selection, normalization, and scaling might have been applied.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details on the preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model, it can be inferred that common preprocessing steps for Landsat images, such as atmospheric correction, radiometric calibration, and geometric correction, might have been applied. Additionally, preprocessing of phenological data and spectral data, such as feature extraction, normalization, and scaling, might have been performed to improve the performance of the deep learning model.
