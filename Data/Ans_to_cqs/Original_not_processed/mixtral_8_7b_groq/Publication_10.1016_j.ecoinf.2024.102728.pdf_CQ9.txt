Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. None of the sources mention where the data used in the studies is stored or shared, or if there is a specific repository for it. It is possible that the data is not publicly available or that it is stored in a repository that is not mentioned in the sources. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
