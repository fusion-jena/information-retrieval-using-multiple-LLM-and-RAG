Based on the provided context, the optimization techniques used in the artificial neural network (ANN) model fitting and evaluation process are not specified as advanced methods such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. Instead, the context focuses on the use of a single hidden-layer neural network with two hyperparameters: size and decay. The number of units in the hidden layer (size) and regularization parameter to avoid overfitting (decay) are optimized to find the best model fit based on accuracy.

However, the context does mention the use of a regularization parameter, decay, to prevent overfitting. This technique can be seen as a simple form of optimization, as it helps in finding a balance between fitting the training data and maintaining generalization capabilities for unseen data.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the use of optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam, it does discuss the use of a regularization parameter, decay, to prevent overfitting. This can be considered a simple form of optimization in the deep learning pipeline.
