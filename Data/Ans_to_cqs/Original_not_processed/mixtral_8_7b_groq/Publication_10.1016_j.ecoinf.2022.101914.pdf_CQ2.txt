Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the data format used in the modeling pipeline is not explicitly specified as image, audio, video, or a particular file format such as CSV. However, it can be inferred that the data used in this study is likely in a format that can be processed by the biomod2 package in R, which is used to build the component models. This package typically works with tabular data, where each row represents a sample and columns represent different variables or features associated with that sample.

The data is divided into presence and background points, and the spatial distribution of these points is considered during the division of data into training and testing datasets. A spatial blocking technique is used, where the study area is divided into 25 equally-sized blocks, and these blocks are further divided among five folds for cross-validation. This suggests that the data has a spatial component and is likely in a format that can represent spatial coordinates, such as latitude and longitude.

Furthermore, the component models used in this study include Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Maximum Entropy software (MaxEnt). Among these, GLMs, GAMs, MARS, and RF typically work with tabular data, while ANN can work with various data formats, including images and time-series data. However, the specific data format used in this study is not mentioned.

Therefore, while the exact data format is not specified, it can be inferred that the data used in this study is likely in a tabular format with spatial coordinates, which can be processed by the biomod2 package in R and used in the specified modeling approaches.
