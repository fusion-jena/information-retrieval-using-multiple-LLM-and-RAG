Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. The context focuses on the use of color gradients, color maps, and their importance in scientific communication, particularly in the fields of ecological informatics, computational ecology, and oceanography.

There are references to R packages, such as 'cmocean' and 'colourist', which can be used for creating color maps and coloring wildlife distributions in space-time. There is also a mention of Python in a tutorial context. However, there is no mention of deep learning models or their hyperparameters.

Hyperparameters in deep learning models can include learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, activation functions, batch size, and more. These parameters significantly impact the performance and convergence of deep learning models. The choice of these hyperparameters depends on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, there is no information about the hyperparameters used in deep learning models.
