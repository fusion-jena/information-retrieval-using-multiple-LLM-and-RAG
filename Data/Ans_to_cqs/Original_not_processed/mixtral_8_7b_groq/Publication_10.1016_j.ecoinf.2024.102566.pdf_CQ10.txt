Answer:::
I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or any code repository links related to it. The context focuses on a study about forest biomass density in the Qinba Mountains, including data on needleleaf forest, broadleaf forest, and mixed forest from various inventory periods. While the study uses GIMMS NDVI3g dataset for downscaling and creating a 1 km resolution map, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link.
