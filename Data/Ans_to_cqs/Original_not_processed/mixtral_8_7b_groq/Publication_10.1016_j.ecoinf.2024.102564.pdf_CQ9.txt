Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context focuses on the comparison of machine learning models, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forests (RF), for modeling net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil.

The study mentions the input and output variables, techniques, algorithms, functions, and statistics of the models, but it does not provide any details about the data repository. Therefore, it is not possible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.

It is possible that the data repository is not publicly available or was not mentioned in the study. If you need access to the data, it may be worth reaching out to the authors of the study to inquire about the availability of the data repository.

In summary, based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study.
