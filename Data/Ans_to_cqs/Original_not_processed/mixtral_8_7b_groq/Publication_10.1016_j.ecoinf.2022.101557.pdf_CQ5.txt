Answer:::

The context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the study used maps from OpenStreetMap as the primary data source. The maps were pre-processed and split into smaller areas of 80 Ã— 80 pixels for training and evaluation of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). A 10-fold cross validation was performed using these smaller areas, with 9 sets used for training and the final set used for evaluation. During training, 20% of the samples were used as a validation set to prevent overfitting.
