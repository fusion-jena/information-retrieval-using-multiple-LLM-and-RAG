Answer:::

The training process of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is determined to be complete when the validation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) does not further improve compared to the preceding epochs and diverges from the training MAE, indicating an 'overfit' situation.

In other words, the training of the model continues until the MAE of the validation dataset stops decreasing and starts to increase compared to the training MAE, which suggests that the model has started to overfit the training data. At this point, the training process is considered complete.

Additionally, the training process involves a batch size of 20 images, an RMSprop optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and a learning rate decay of 0.0001, and the chosen loss function is mean squared error. The prediction accuracy is quantified by the MAE of the respective dataset.

The validation dataset is used to monitor the training progress after each full training cycle (epoch), and the model training is carried out on a workstation with two CUDA-compatible NVIDIA GPUs (GeForce RTX 2080 Ti, CUDA version 11.0).

Furthermore, the target values are log10-transformed and normalized between 0 and 1 using the minimum and maximum values of the log10-transformed training dataset exclusively, preventing any leakage of information from the validation and test datasets to the training process. The same normalization scheme is applied to the bioclimatic variables.

Therefore, the training of the CNN model is determined to be complete based on the validation MAE not improving and diverging from the training MAE, while considering the specified hyperparameters and data preprocessing techniques.
