Answer:::

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a hybrid model that combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). This hybrid CNN-LSTM model is designed to enhance processing power, improve robustness, and better handle the complexity of drought propagation time and the relationship between influencing factors.

The CNN component of the model is used to extract spatial features from the input data, while the LSTM component is used to capture temporal dynamics. By embedding LSTM into the CNN, the model's prediction accuracy on the testing set has improved by about 20% compared to the original CNN, even without any adjustments to the hyperparameters.

This specific combination of CNN and LSTM models is chosen because of its ability to effectively handle sequential data, which is crucial for analyzing the temporal dynamics of various factors' influence on drought propagation. The model is applied to a comprehensive dataset that includes various influencing factors and an extensive drought propagation time series spanning from January 1950 to December 2020.

In summary, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a hybrid CNN-LSTM model, which is specifically designed to analyze the temporal dynamics of drought propagation and the influence of various factors on it.
