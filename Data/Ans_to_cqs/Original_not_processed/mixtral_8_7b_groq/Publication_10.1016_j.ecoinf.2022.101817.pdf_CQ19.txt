Answer:::
The provided context does not give information about the specific deep learning framework used to build the CNN model. The text focuses on the details of the designed CNN model, which is based on the VGG architecture, and its performance in classifying terrestrial images under different environmental conditions. It mentions that the model was designed with 12 layers, unlike the conventional VGG16 or VGG19 models, and shows the confusion matrices for the validation performance of CNN Model 4.

However, it does not specify the deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) used to build the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
