Answer:::

In the context of deep learning model training, the data is typically split into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. Although the context does not explicitly mention the criteria used for this split, there are common practices in the field.

1. Training set: This is the portion of the data used to train the model. In supervised learning, the training data consists of input and target image pairs, where the input image describes the image to be classified and the target image describes the corresponding classes. For semantic image segmentation, the target image consists of a fully labeled image, with every single pixel assigned to a certain class.

2. Validation set: This set is used to validate the model during the training process. The model's hyperparameters, such as learning rate or regularization strength, are often adjusted based on the performance on the validation set. This helps to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model learns the training data too well, to the point where it performs poorly on unseen data.

3. Testing set: This is the final set used to evaluate the model's performance. It is crucial that the testing data remains unseen during the training process. The performance on the testing set provides an unbiased estimate of how the model will generalize to new, unseen data.

It is important to note that the data split should be random, but stratified if the data is imbalanced. Stratification ensures that each set maintains the same distribution of classes as the original data.

Moreover, the context highlights the importance of having a training dataset that resembles the data on which the model will be applied, especially in long-term biomonitoring where data distributions can change over time due to different recording conditions or devices. This is a separate concern from the training, validation, and testing data split but is crucial for the model's performance in real-world applications.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the criteria for splitting data in deep learning, common practice involves using a training set for learning, a validation set for adjusting hyperparameters, and a testing set for unbiased performance evaluation. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the training data resembles the data the model will encounter in its intended application.
