After reviewing the provided sources, I was unable to locate information regarding the data repository of a deep learning pipeline. While the sources contain various studies related to remote sensing, machine learning, and ecological construction programs, none of them explicitly mention the data repository for a deep learning pipeline.

Some of the sources, such as Liu et al. (2018), Liu et al. (2022), Qin et al. (2022), and Tong et al. (2020), discuss the application of remote sensing and machine learning techniques in ecological studies, but they do not provide information about the data repository for their deep learning pipelines.

Sources like Marrs and Ni-Meister (2019), Torresani et al. (2023), and Viana et al. (2012) focus on machine learning techniques for tree species classification, canopy height estimation, and biomass estimation, respectively. However, they do not mention the data repository for their deep learning pipelines either.

In summary, I was unable to find information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline in the provided sources. If the information is available in other sources, I would recommend looking at the documentation or materials accompanying the deep learning pipeline or contacting the authors directly for clarification.
