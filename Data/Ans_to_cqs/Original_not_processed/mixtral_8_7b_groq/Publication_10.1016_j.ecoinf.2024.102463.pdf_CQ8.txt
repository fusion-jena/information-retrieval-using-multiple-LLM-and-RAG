Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information given about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The context mainly focuses on the study that evaluates the relevance of a deep learning tool for reconstructing caesium-137 chronics particulate concentration in rivers using a specific neural network architecture called "Hierarchical Attention-Based Recurrent Highway Networks" (HRHN).

The context describes the different parameters used in the HRHN architecture, such as the CNN window size, the number of filters, the number of hidden layers, and the dimension of the hidden state. However, there is no mention of where the code repository for this deep learning pipeline can be found.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query as it is not addressed in the given context.
