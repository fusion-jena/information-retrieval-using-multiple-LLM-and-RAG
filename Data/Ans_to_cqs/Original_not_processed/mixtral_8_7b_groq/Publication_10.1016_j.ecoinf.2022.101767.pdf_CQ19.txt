Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context discusses a study related to wild bird species richness in online shared videos and the benefits of using these videos as a data source for ecological studies. It mentions two studies by Y. Kikuchi et al. published in Ecological Informatics in 2022, but it does not provide details about the deep learning models or the frameworks used to build them. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
