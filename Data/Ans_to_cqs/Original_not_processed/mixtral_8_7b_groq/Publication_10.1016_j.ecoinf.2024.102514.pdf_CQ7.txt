Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the data splitting criteria for machine learning (ML) models, not specifically deep learning models, were discussed. In the study, the WQ indicator data was divided into training and testing data sets with an 80% and 20% ratio, respectively. This means that 80% of the data was used for training the ML models, and the remaining 20% was used for testing the models. No validation data set was mentioned in the context.

In ML, typical data splitting ratios for training and testing datasets are 80% and 20%, 67% and 33%, and 50% and 50%, respectively. After partitioning the data, eight ML models were trained and tested on training and testing datasets. Later, performances of the model were conducted for both phases.

It is worth noting that in deep learning, data splitting is typically done into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. However, the context provided does not mention the use of a validation set, which is a crucial step in deep learning model training.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training typically include a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. However, the context only discusses the use of a training set and a testing set for ML models.
