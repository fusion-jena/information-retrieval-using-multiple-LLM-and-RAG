Answer:::
The provided context does not specify any type of deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers being used in the pipeline. The context discusses various machine learning models and techniques used for predicting aboveground biomass (AGB) but does not mention any deep learning models. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine what type of deep learning model, if any, is used in the pipeline.
