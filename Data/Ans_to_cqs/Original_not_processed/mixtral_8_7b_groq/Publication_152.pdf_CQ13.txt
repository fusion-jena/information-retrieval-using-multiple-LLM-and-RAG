Answer:::

The specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not provided in the given context. However, it does mention the use of data augmentation and the Adam optimizer. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by creating modified versions of images in the dataset, such as changes in brightness, zoom, and height. This can help improve the model's performance by providing more varied data. The Adam optimizer is a method for stochastic optimization that is often used in training deep learning models. It is an extension of stochastic gradient descent that uses adaptive learning rates for each parameter.

Additionally, the authors mention using a U-Net architecture for the model, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for biomedical image segmentation. U-Net consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path for precise localization. The network uses skip connections between the contracting and expanding paths to retain high-resolution information.

However, the learning rate, which is an important hyperparameter that determines the size of the steps that the model takes during training, is not specified. The learning rate can significantly impact the model's performance and convergence, and it is often tuned during the training process to find the optimal value.

In summary, while the given context mentions the use of data augmentation and the Adam optimizer, it does not provide specific information on other hyperparameters such as the learning rate.
