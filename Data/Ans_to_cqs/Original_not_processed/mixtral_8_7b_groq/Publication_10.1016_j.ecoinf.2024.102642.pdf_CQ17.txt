Answer:::
In the deep learning pipeline described in the context, a dropout layer is used as a regularization method to prevent overfitting. Specifically, a dropout rate of 0.25 is employed in a CNN model comprising three convolutional layers followed by three fully connected layers. This dropout layer is incorporated between the convolutional layers and the fully connected layers to introduce randomness during training, thereby preventing over-dependence on specific neurons and reducing overfitting. No explicit mention of L2 regularization is made in the provided context.

The need for regularization arises from the fact that the training sets used in this study are relatively small, as indicated in Table 1. In such scenarios, there is a risk of overfitting, where the model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization techniques help mitigate this risk by adding a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging large weights, and promoting generalization.

In summary, the regularization method used in the described deep learning pipeline is dropout, with a dropout rate of 0.25. This method is applied to a CNN model with three convolutional and three fully connected layers to prevent overfitting and improve the model's performance on unseen data.
