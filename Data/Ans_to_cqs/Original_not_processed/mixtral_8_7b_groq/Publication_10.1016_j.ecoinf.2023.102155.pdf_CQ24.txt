Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, the context does discuss a study that compares the performance of various methods, including "indiv" (individual method) and "CoinF" (a method that randomly assigns initial point labels), in the context of ecological informatics.

In this study, the authors evaluate the performance of these methods in retrieving an initial process at different levels of hidden observations (20%, 50%, and 80%) and with or without tests of lasso regularization and bias correction. The results suggest that the methods' performance varies depending on the amount of hidden observations and the use of lasso regularization and bias correction.

While this study does not directly address the question of how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline, it does highlight the importance of considering randomness in the development and evaluation of machine learning methods. The use of randomness in methods such as "CoinF" suggests that the authors recognize the potential impact of randomness on method performance and are taking steps to account for it in their evaluations.

In general, the use of a random seed value is a common strategy for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. By setting a fixed random seed value, researchers can ensure that the random processes used in the pipeline, such as the initialization of weights or the selection of training examples, are reproducible across different runs of the pipeline. This can help to improve the reliability and validity of the pipeline's output.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly address the question of how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest that the authors of the study are aware of the potential impact of randomness on method performance and are taking steps to account for it in their evaluations. Additionally, the use of a random seed value is a common strategy for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, which can help to improve the reliability and validity of the pipeline's output.
