Answer:::

The text provided does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validating the deep learning model. However, it does provide some context about the data and the methods used in the study that may help infer possible approaches.

In the study, the authors used Landsat images and a cluster classification map to collect training data for a supervised classification algorithm. They selected 70 training sites (each point represents one pixel on the map) for each of the five classes (mines, water, forest, urban areas, and bare soil), making up a total of 350 points per image. These points were chosen using a stratified (by class) random sampling approach and were distributed across the entire study area.

The selection of a stratified random sampling approach suggests that the authors aimed to ensure that each class was adequately represented in the training data. This method can help reduce bias and improve the model's ability to generalize to the entire study area.

Furthermore, the authors used a cluster classification algorithm to segment each image into 10 classes based on RGB, near infrared, and shortwave infrared bands. This step allowed for an initial assessment of the study area and the identification of sub-class spectral patterns that existed within each of the five final classes. The cluster images were then used for a more informed decision about suitable locations for training sites for the supervised classification.

Based on this information, it is plausible that the authors used a portion of the 350 training points per image for training the deep learning model, while reserving a separate subset for testing and validating the model's performance. However, the text does not provide explicit details about the criteria used for splitting the data. Common approaches for splitting data in machine learning include random sampling, k-fold cross-validation, or using separate datasets for training, testing, and validation.
