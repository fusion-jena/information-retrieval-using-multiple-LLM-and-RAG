Answer:::

The provided context does not include specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some studies that use artificial neural networks in various fields such as forest vegetation mapping, global climate change, and ecological research. These studies might have used different datasets depending on their specific research questions and objectives.

In general, deep learning models have been applied to a wide range of datasets in various domains. Some of the commonly used datasets in deep learning research include:

1. MNIST: A dataset of handwritten digits that consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
2. CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100: Datasets of natural images that consist of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 and 100 classes, respectively.
3. ImageNet: A large-scale dataset of over 14 million images that belong to 1000 classes.
4. COCO: A dataset of common objects in context that consists of over 330,000 images and 80 object categories.
5. Kaggle datasets: A platform that hosts a wide variety of datasets for machine learning competitions and projects.

These datasets have been used to train and evaluate deep learning models for various tasks such as image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and natural language processing.

In summary, the provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, deep learning models have been applied to a wide range of datasets in various domains, including MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet.
