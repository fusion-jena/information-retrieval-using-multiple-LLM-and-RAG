Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about how the hyperparameters of the Random Forest (RF) model were optimized for this study. Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned from the data but instead are set prior to training the model. Examples of RF hyperparameters include the number of trees, the number of variables considered at each split, and the maximum depth of the trees.

There are various methods for hyperparameter optimization, including grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves specifying a range of possible values for each hyperparameter and then training the model with all possible combinations of these values. Random search, on the other hand, involves randomly selecting values for the hyperparameters within specified ranges and training the model with these values. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic approach to iteratively select hyperparameter values that are expected to result in good model performance.

Without more information from the study, it is not possible to say for certain which method was used to optimize the RF hyperparameters. However, it is mentioned that the RF models "naturally modeled potential interactions" and were able to handle collinearity among predictors, which suggests that some form of hyperparameter optimization was used to ensure that the model was able to handle these complexities.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about how the RF hyperparameters were optimized, it is mentioned that some form of hyperparameter optimization was used to ensure that the model was able to handle complexities in the data.
