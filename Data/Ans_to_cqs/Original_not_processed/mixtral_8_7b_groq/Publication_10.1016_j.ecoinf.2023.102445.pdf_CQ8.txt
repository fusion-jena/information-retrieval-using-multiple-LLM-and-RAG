Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning-based pipeline for estimating the number of insects present in images of color-changing sticky traps, as proposed by Luca Ciampi et al. (2023). The paper discusses the methodology and performance of the pipeline but does not mention where the code for this pipeline can be found. It is possible that the code has not been made publicly available yet, or it could be hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. If you are interested in the code, I would recommend reaching out to the authors directly for more information.
