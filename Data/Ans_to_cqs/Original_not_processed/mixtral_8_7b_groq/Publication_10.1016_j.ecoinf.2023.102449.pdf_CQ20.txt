Answer:::
The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions various techniques and methods used in the training process, such as logistic regression, VAE (Variational Autoencoder), UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection), and wide residual networks. However, it does not specify the physical hardware used for training, like GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) or TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query based on the given context.
