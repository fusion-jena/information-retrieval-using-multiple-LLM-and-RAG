The text provided does not give a detailed explanation of how the hyperparameters of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were optimized. However, it does mention that several values of k were tested for the k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) model, and k = 4 was found to yield the best performance.

In general, there are several methods for optimizing hyperparameters, including grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves systematically testing a finite number of predefined hyperparameter values, while random search involves randomly selecting hyperparameter values to test. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic model to make informed decisions about which hyperparameter values to test next.

Without further information, it is unclear which method was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the CNN used in the DialectDecoder model. It is possible that the authors used a method that is not explicitly mentioned in the text provided. Therefore, a definitive answer to this query cannot be given based on the information provided.
