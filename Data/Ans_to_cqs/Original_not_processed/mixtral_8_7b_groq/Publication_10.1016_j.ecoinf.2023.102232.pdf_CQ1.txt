Based on the provided context, the raw data used in the deep learning pipeline for Precision Agriculture (PA) is primarily collected through field surveys. Field surveys involve direct data collection from the agricultural fields, which can include various types of data such as soil samples, crop yields, weather conditions, and other relevant agricultural data. However, the context highlights that field surveys can be resource-intensive in terms of time, manpower, and materials.

In addition to field surveys, the context does not explicitly mention other sources of raw data such as sensors or public datasets. However, it is possible that these sources of data could be used in other applications of deep learning in PA. For instance, sensors could be used to collect real-time data on various agricultural parameters, while public datasets could provide additional sources of data for training and validating deep learning models.

It is also worth noting that the context describes a specific approach to using deep learning in PA, which involves using a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the results of a least squares (LS) procedure for estimating biological parameters of agricultural species. In this approach, the raw data collected through field surveys is used to estimate the parameters of a physiologically based model that represents the biology of a given species. The GA is then used to optimize the results of the LS procedure and improve the accuracy of the parameter estimates.

Overall, based on the provided context, the primary source of raw data in the deep learning pipeline for PA is field surveys. However, other sources of data such as sensors and public datasets could also be used in other applications of deep learning in PA.
