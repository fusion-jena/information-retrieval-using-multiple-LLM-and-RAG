Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models mentioned in the context are the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, and weight decay.

In the study about hierarchical classification of protein families published in PLoS ONE 2021, the authors used a deep learning model for multitask learning (MTL) with transfer learning. They used the ResNet50 and EfficientNetB3 architectures, which were pre-trained on ImageNet. However, the specific hyperparameters used in their models are not provided in the context.

In the survey of hierarchical classification across different application domains published in Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 2011, the authors discussed various hyperparameters used in deep learning models for hierarchical classification. They mentioned that the learning rate, batch size, and weight decay are important hyperparameters that can affect the performance of the models.

In the paper about a disciplined approach to neural network hyperparameters published in arXiv 2018, the author discussed the learning rate, batch size, momentum, and weight decay in detail. The author suggested using a learning rate schedule, a batch size of 256, a momentum of 0.9, and a weight decay of 0.0001 for most deep learning models.

In the study about EfficientNet published in the 36th International Conference on Machine Learning 2019, the authors introduced a new neural network architecture called EfficientNet. They used a compound scaling method to scale up the network width, depth, and resolution simultaneously. They also used a learning rate schedule and a weight decay of 0.00004.

In the study about personalized multitask learning for predicting tomorrow's mood, stress, and health published in IEEE Transactions on Affective Computing 2020, the authors used a deep learning model with MTL for predicting affective states. They used the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and a batch size of 32.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the commonly used hyperparameters in deep learning models are the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, and weight decay. However, the specific values of these hyperparameters may vary depending on the model architecture, dataset, and task.
