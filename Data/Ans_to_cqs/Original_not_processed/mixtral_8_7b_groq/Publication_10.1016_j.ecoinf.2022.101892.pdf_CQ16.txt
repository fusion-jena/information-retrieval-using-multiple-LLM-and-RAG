Answer:::
The context provided does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the Cross-Subject Similarity (CS) is calculated based on the Equation (1) in the context. It is possible that the training is complete when the Cross-Subject Similarity or some other evaluation metric reaches a certain threshold or plateaus. In general, training of machine learning models is often considered complete when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, or when the model's performance on a separate validation set stops improving. It is also possible that the training is complete when it reaches a predetermined number of epochs. Without more information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.

Additionally, it is worth noting that the authors of the study mentioned in the context have used five-fold Subject-Exclusive (SE) Protocol with an OR method to evaluate the performance of different models on the PAD Lite dataset. They have used Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Cross-Subject Similarity (CS) as evaluation metrics. The CS is calculated based on the Equation (1) in the context, which is the exponential of the sum of the logits of the output for each sample, divided by the sum of the exponentials of the logits for all classes, multiplied by the number of classes.

Another point that can be inferred from the context is that the models were trained and tested on facial images of pandas, and the models struggled with adult pandas, often categorizing pandas aged 17 to 25 with pandas aged 7 to 17 years.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, it is possible that the training is complete when the Cross-Subject Similarity or some other evaluation metric reaches a certain threshold or plateaus. Additionally, the authors have used five-fold Subject-Exclusive (SE) Protocol with an OR method and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Cross-Subject Similarity (CS) as evaluation metrics to evaluate the performance of different models on the PAD Lite dataset.
