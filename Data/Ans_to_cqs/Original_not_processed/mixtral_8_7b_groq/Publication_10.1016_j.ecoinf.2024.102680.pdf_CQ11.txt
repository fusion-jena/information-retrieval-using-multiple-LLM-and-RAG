Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various deep learning models, such as Faster RCNN, Libra RCNN, FCOS, ATSS, YOLOv5m, and YOLOv8m, and their performance on the URPC 2020 dataset. However, it does not mention any data repository link for these models or their training data.

The context also describes the input layer of UODN, which performs preprocessing operations on the initial images, such as resizing and mosaic data augmentation. But again, it does not provide any link to the data repository used for training UODN or any other models.

Therefore, I cannot provide the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
