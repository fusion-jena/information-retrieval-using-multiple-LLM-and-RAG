Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps taken after the model training for the MLPnn-MC model. However, it is common practice in machine learning and remote sensing applications to perform certain postprocessing steps to evaluate the model's performance and gain insights into the model behavior.

Here are some possible postprocessing steps that could be applied after training a model like MLPnn-MC:

1. **Calculation of metrics**: Metrics such as overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, F1 score, and Cohen's kappa can be calculated to assess the model's performance. These metrics provide a quantitative evaluation of the model's ability to classify land use and land cover (LULC) categories accurately.

2. **Confusion matrix**: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the classification results by comparing the predicted classes with the actual (ground truth) classes. It provides a detailed breakdown of where the model is making errors, such as misclassifying one LULC category as another.

3. **Saliency maps**: Saliency maps are a technique for visualizing the importance of input features for a given prediction. They can help identify which features the model is relying on the most to make its predictions. However, the provided context does not mention the use of saliency maps specifically for the MLPnn-MC model.

4. **Cross-validation**: Cross-validation is a technique for assessing the model's performance by dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on different combinations of these subsets, and evaluating the model's performance on the remaining portions of the data. This technique can help reduce overfitting and provide a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

5. **Error analysis**: Error analysis involves examining the misclassified samples in detail to understand the reasons for the errors. This process can help identify areas where the model is struggling and inform the development of strategies to improve the model's performance.

Based on the provided context, it is unclear if any of these specific postprocessing steps were taken. However, it is important to perform these steps to ensure the model's performance and applicability for LULC classification and prediction tasks.
