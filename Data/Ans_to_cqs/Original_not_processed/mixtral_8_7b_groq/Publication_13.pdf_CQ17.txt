Answer: Based on the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout.

The deep learning pipeline described in the context involves training a neural network with a dataset of local low-quality (LL) images, specifically single-specimen photographs taken using a stereoscope. The neural network consists of two fully connected (FC) layers, with 512 and 256 units, respectively. During training, the stochastic gradient descent algorithm with softmax cross-entropy loss was used for 300 epochs, with a batch size of 10 and a fixed learning rate of 0.01.

To prevent overfitting, the dropout rate was determined using five-fold cross-validation. However, the specific value of the dropout rate is not provided in the context. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the input units to zero during training, which helps prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of feature detectors (Srivastava et al., 2014).

Other regularization techniques, such as L2 regularization, are not explicitly mentioned in the context. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which can help prevent overfitting. However, the context only mentions dropout as a regularization method.

It's worth noting that the deep learning pipeline in the context also employs domain adversarial training (DANN) to improve the classification performance between datasets. DANN incorporates a portion of the unknown target dataset in the model and jointly predicts the class label of the source images and the dataset (domain) of all input images. While DANN is not a regularization method, it can help improve the generalization performance of the model by learning domain-invariant features.
