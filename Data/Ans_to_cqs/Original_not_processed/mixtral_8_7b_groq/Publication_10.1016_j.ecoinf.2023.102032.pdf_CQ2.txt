The specific details about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not provided in the given pieces of context. However, based on the URL and some of the terms mentioned, it can be inferred that the data format is likely to be image data.

The URL refers to an article on Medium about improving cloud detection with machine learning, and the article is focused on Sentinel-2 image data. Sentinel-2 is a European Space Agency (ESA) Earth observation mission that provides high-resolution optical imagery of the Earth's surface. Therefore, it is likely that the deep learning pipeline in question is using Sentinel-2 image data as input.

Furthermore, the term "wetland use intensity" (WUI) suggests that the data format is likely to be image data. WUI is a measure of the intensity of human activity in wetland areas, and it is typically calculated by analyzing satellite or aerial imagery. Therefore, it is likely that the deep learning pipeline is using image data to calculate WUI for wetland areas in East Africa.

However, it is important to note that this is an inference based on the given context, and the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated. Therefore, further information would be needed to provide a definitive answer.
