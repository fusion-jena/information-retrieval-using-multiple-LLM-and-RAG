Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. The context focuses on the metadata, data organization, and file descriptions for a specific dataset related to E-Field measurements.

However, when evaluating the performance of a deep learning model, several metrics are commonly used, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics help assess the model's ability to classify or predict outcomes correctly.

Answer:::
 The context provided does not include information on the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, in the general context of machine learning and deep learning, metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are commonly used to assess a model's performance.
