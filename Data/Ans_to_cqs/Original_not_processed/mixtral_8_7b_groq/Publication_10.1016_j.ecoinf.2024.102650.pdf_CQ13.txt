Answer:::
The provided context does not include specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The focus of the text is on the application of the ERNIE model for emotion analysis and the use of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling.

However, it is important to note that the choice of hyperparameters can significantly impact the performance of a deep learning model. Common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include learning rate, batch size, number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each layer, and type of optimizer.

The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. Common choices for the learning rate include fixed values, step decay, and adaptive learning rates.

The optimizer is a function that updates the weights of the model based on the gradient of the loss function. Common optimizers used in deep learning include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.

The batch size determines the number of samples used to calculate the gradient of the loss function at each iteration. A larger batch size can result in more stable gradients but may require more memory.

The number of hidden layers and number of neurons in each layer determine the complexity of the model. A larger number of layers and neurons can result in a more expressive model but may also lead to overfitting.

In summary, while the provided context does not include specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, the choice of hyperparameters can significantly impact the performance of the model. Common hyperparameters include learning rate, batch size, number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each layer, and type of optimizer.
