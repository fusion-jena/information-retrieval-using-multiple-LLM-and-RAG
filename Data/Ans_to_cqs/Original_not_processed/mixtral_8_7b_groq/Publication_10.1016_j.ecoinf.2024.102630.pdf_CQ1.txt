The text provided does not give specific information about the deep learning pipeline used in the study. However, it does mention the use of several remote sensing datasets to obtain NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data. These datasets include the 16-day synthesized MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI dataset (MODIS NDVI), the daily NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of AVHRR NDVI V5 dataset (CDR AVHRR NDVI), the third generation GIMMS NDVI from AVHRR sensors dataset (GIMMS NDVI), and SPOT/VEGETATION products (SPOT NDVI). 

The MODIS NDVI, CDR AVHRR NDVI, and GIMMS NDVI datasets are sourced from the Google Earth Engine platform, which provides rich remote sensing data. The SPOT NDVI dataset is sourced from the Resource and Environmental Data Center of the Ecological Informatics. 

Therefore, it can be inferred that the raw data for this study was collected using remote sensing satellites or sensors. The specific sensors used for each dataset are not mentioned, but MODIS, AVHRR, and SPOT are all Earth observation satellite systems that capture data in various bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, which can then be processed to calculate NDVI.

Public datasets, such as those provided by the Google Earth Engine platform and the Resource and Environmental Data Center, were used to obtain the NDVI data. The text does not mention any surveys or other methods for collecting raw data.
