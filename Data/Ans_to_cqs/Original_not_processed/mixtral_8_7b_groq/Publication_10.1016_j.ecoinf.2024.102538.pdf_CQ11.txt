Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in bird population studies. The text focuses on the description of a new approach called Phylogenetic Perspective Neural Network (PPNN), which incorporates hierarchical multilevel labels for each bird and uses a hierarchical semantic embedding framework to capture feature information at different levels.

The authors mention that they conducted experiments on bird acoustic datasets, but they do not specify where the datasets can be found or accessed. They only compare the performance of their proposed method with other existing methods, such as 3DCNN-LSTM and Soundception, but there is no reference to a data repository link for these methods either.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in bird population studies based on the given context. If you need access to bird acoustic datasets or other related resources, I would recommend searching specialized databases such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, or contacting the authors of the relevant studies for further information.
