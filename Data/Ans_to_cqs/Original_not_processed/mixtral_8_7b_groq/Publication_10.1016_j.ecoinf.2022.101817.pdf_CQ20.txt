Based on the provided context, the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model are not explicitly stated. However, we can infer that some of the systems have the capability to perform deep learning tasks due to their specifications.

The AMD Ryzen 9 95,900x and Intel Core i7-12700K processors have high core and thread counts, large memory capacities, and fast core clock speeds, making them suitable for general-purpose computing tasks, including deep learning model training. However, these systems do not have specialized hardware, such as GPUs or TPUs, explicitly mentioned.

The Nvidia Jetson Nano, MediaTek Pumpkin i500, and Raspberry Pi 4 systems have GPUs, which can be used for deep learning tasks. The Nvidia Jetson Nano features a 128-core Maxwell GPU, the MediaTek Pumpkin i500 has an Imagination PowerVR Series8XE GPU, and the Raspberry Pi 4 has a VideoCore VI GPU. These GPUs can accelerate deep learning tasks, especially when using frameworks optimized for the specific GPU architecture.

The Cortex-A57, Cortex-A72, and Cortex-A73 Cortex-A53 systems do not have explicitly mentioned specialized hardware for deep learning tasks. However, they can still perform deep learning tasks using their CPUs, albeit at a slower pace compared to systems with GPUs or TPUs.

In summary, the Nvidia Jetson Nano, MediaTek Pumpkin i500, and Raspberry Pi 4 systems have GPUs that can be used for deep learning tasks. The other systems, AMD Ryzen 9 95,900x, Intel Core i7-12700K, and the various Cortex processors, can perform deep learning tasks using their CPUs, but they may not be as efficient as systems with GPUs or TPUs.
