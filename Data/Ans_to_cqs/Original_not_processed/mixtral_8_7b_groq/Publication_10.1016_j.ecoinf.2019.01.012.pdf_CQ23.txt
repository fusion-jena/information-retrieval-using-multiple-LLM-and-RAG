The generalizability of a deep learning model refers to its ability to perform well on unseen data, by avoiding overfitting on the training data and learning robust features. Based on the provided context, several measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model in this study:

1. **Data shuffling and stratified splitting**: To prevent spatial autocorrelation between neighboring tiles, the tiles were collected in one folder, shuffled, and then split into training, validation, and test sets. This process is called stratified splitting, as it ensures that each set has a similar distribution of classes.
2. **Data augmentation**: To increase the number of training samples and expose the model to more variations, data augmentation was performed on the training set. This involves applying slight transformations to the original data, such as rotation, scaling, or flipping.
3. **Hyperparameter tuning**: The validation set was used during training for the fine-tuning of hyperparameters and model selection. This allows the model to learn the optimal parameters that minimize the loss function and improve the performance on unseen data.
4. **Model evaluation on different datasets**: The final model was tested on two different datasets: individual tiles and whole repeat photographs. This provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's generalizability, as it assesses its performance on different levels of granularity and context.
5. **Scratch training**: Instead of using pre-trained models, the model was trained from scratch. This ensures that the model learns features that are specific to the current classification problem, rather than relying on features that may not be relevant or optimal for the task.

These measures help to improve the generalizability of the deep learning model by reducing overfitting, increasing the diversity of the training data, and optimizing the model parameters. However, it is important to note that these measures alone do not guarantee the generalizability of the model, as other factors such as the quality and quantity of the data, the complexity of the model, and the similarity between the training and test data can also affect the model's performance.
