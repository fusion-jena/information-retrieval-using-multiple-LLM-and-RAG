Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline described in the text uses audio data as its primary input format. The audio data is converted into mel spectrograms using a fast Fourier transform window size of 1024, hop length of 896, and 128 mel filterbanks. These mel spectrograms are then used as input for the ResNet152-based models, which have been trained from scratch with randomly initialized weights.

Additionally, the pipeline uses two pre-trained models, VGGish and BirdNET, which were originally trained on audio data as well. VGGish is a 128-dimensional embeddings model trained on YouTube-8M, a large-scale video dataset with over 3,000 classes, including many related to animals and their sounds. BirdNET, on the other hand, is a model specifically designed for bird species classification, which takes 3-second audio inputs.

There is no mention of using other data formats such as images, videos, or CSV files in this pipeline. The focus is on processing and analyzing audio data using deep learning techniques.
