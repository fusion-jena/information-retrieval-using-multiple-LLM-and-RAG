Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the use of deep learning models, including the frameworks used for building them such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The text focuses on the classification of input dataset combinations using three classifiers (RF, SVM, MARS) with two sets of classes (7C and 13C), resulting in 60 models. The classifications and hyperparameter tuning were conducted in R 4.2 with the caret package. The accuracy assessment includes Jeffries-Matusita separability analysis, but it does not mention deep learning models or their frameworks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
