Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. There is no mention of any link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context focuses on the methodology and architecture of a deep learning approach for ecoacoustic representations, but it does not provide information about the data used or the repository where it can be found. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested link.
