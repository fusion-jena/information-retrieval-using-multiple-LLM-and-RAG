Answer:::
The given context discusses two different cloud services, Google Earth Engine (GEE) and NASA's MODIS/VIIRS Land Products Web Service. Let's address the deep learning frameworks used in each service.

For Google Earth Engine (GEE), the context specifies that deep learning analysis can be carried out using TensorFlow, an open-source framework developed by Google's Brain team. However, the text also points out that GEE is a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service), meaning that users cannot modify or introduce different deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), or Caffe. Therefore, for GEE, only TensorFlow is the deep learning framework available for users.

Regarding the NASA Web Service API, the provided context focuses on the nasawebservice Python package, which facilitates automatic MODIS data ingestion from the NASA MODIS/VIIRS Land Products Web Service. However, the context does not mention any deep learning frameworks being used or supported within this package.

In summary, based on the given context, the deep learning models in Google Earth Engine can be built using TensorFlow, while the nasawebservice package does not explicitly support any deep learning frameworks.
