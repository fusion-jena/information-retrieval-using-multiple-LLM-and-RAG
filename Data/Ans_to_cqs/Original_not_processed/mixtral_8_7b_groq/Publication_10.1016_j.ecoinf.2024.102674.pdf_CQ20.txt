Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model in the study by Dujardin and Lehning (2022). However, it is mentioned that they used the "deep learning" approach to downscale near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography.

Deep learning models typically require substantial computational resources, including Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), to handle the large amounts of data and computations involved. GPUs are particularly well-suited for deep learning tasks due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which is essential for training complex neural network models.

In the context, there is no explicit mention of the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given information.
