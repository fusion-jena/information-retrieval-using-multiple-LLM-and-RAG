The provided context does not give specific details about the process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was trained on a GPU server and a desktop PC using different training sets. The implication is that the trained model was then deployed to perform the task it was designed for, such as automatically identifying, counting, and describing wild animals in camera-trap images.

The context also mentions that the DCNN model used in the study was the AlexNet model, which included five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers. This information suggests that the model was likely serialized, or saved in a file format that can be used to reload the model and its weights, so that it can be deployed and used for inference.

In addition, the context provides information about the training process, including the use of Local Response Normalization (LRN) processing, Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function processing, and downsampling using the mean pooling method. This information suggests that the training process included several steps to optimize the model's performance.

Overall, while the context does not provide specific details about the process used to deploy the trained deep learning model, it does suggest that the model was likely serialized and then deployed to perform the task it was designed for, after undergoing a training process that included several optimization steps.
