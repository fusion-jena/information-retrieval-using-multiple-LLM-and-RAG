Answer:::

Based on the information provided, specific preprocessing steps before training a deep learning model like MLPnn-MC are not mentioned. However, I can provide some common preprocessing steps that are generally involved in training deep learning models.

Deep learning models, including MLPnn-MC, typically require preprocessing of input data to improve model performance and convergence. Common preprocessing steps include:

1. Data cleaning: This involves removing noise, outliers, or missing values from the dataset. For raster data, this might include removing cloud cover or speckle noise.

2. Data normalization or scaling: Deep learning models are sensitive to the scale of input features. Therefore, it is essential to normalize or scale the data to a similar range, usually between 0 and 1. This ensures that all features contribute equally to the learning process.

3. Data augmentation: This technique is used to increase the size of the dataset by applying transformations like rotation, scaling, or flipping to the existing data. Data augmentation helps improve model generalization and prevents overfitting.

4. Feature extraction or selection: Depending on the complexity of the problem, feature extraction or selection techniques might be applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. This can help improve model performance and reduce training time.

In the context of the study, the raster and supplementary data provided in Table 1 of the document undergo preprocessing before being used as input for the MLPnn-MC model. However, the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned.

In summary, while the specific preprocessing steps for the MLPnn-MC model are not provided in the context, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include data cleaning, normalization or scaling, data augmentation, and feature extraction or selection.
