Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline code is not directly provided in the given text, nor is there a specific link to a code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) mentioned. However, the text does mention that the deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained using the Python-based open-source library "fastai" version 1, available at this link: <https://github.com/fastai/fastai>. It is likely that the code for the deep learning pipeline is based on this library and can be found in the associated code repository. Nonetheless, without specific instructions from the authors or additional information, locating the exact code repository may require further investigation.
