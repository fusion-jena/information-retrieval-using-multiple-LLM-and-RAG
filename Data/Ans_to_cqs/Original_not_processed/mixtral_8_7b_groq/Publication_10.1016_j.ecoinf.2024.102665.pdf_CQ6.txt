Based on the provided context, there are no specific preprocessing steps mentioned for training a deep learning model. However, there are some general data preprocessing techniques that are commonly used before training deep learning models, which include:

1. Data cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant, missing, or duplicate data from the dataset. In the context of the second paper, it is mentioned that due to the restrictions in MWST, the representation of data might not be as high as other learning methods. Therefore, data cleaning is an essential step to ensure that the model is trained on high-quality data.
2. Normalization and scaling: These techniques are used to transform the data to a similar scale, which helps the model to learn better. In the context of deep learning models, normalization and scaling are crucial steps, especially when dealing with images or time-series data. For instance, in the first paper, the authors studied the effect of water motion on coral photosynthesis and calcification. Here, normalization and scaling of the data could be useful to ensure that the model learns the appropriate features from the data.
3. Feature extraction: This technique involves selecting the most relevant features from the dataset that are useful for training the model. In the context of the third paper, the authors combined fish and benthic communities into multiple regimes, revealing complex reef dynamics. Here, feature extraction could be useful to select the most relevant features that represent the fish and benthic communities.
4. Data augmentation: This technique involves creating new data by applying transformations to the existing data. This technique is useful when the dataset is small, and it helps the model to generalize better. In the context of the second paper, data augmentation could be useful to create new data for the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming.

Therefore, based on the general practices in deep learning, data cleaning, normalization and scaling, feature extraction, and data augmentation are some of the preprocessing steps that could be involved before training a deep learning model.
