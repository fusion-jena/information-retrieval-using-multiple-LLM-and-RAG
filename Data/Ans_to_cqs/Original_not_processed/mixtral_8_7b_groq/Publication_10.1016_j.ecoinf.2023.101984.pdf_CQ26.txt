Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the deep learning pipeline or data bias techniques used during its preprocessing. However, I can provide a general explanation of some common techniques used to address data bias in machine learning, which can also be applied to deep learning.

1. Stratified sampling: This technique is used to ensure that the training and testing datasets are representative of the overall data distribution. In a stratified sampling approach, the data is divided into subgroups (strata) based on specific criteria (e.g., class labels), and then a sample is taken from each subgroup. This ensures that each subgroup is proportionally represented in the training and testing datasets.

2. Oversampling: In oversampling, the minority class in the dataset is increased by replicating instances. This technique helps to balance the dataset and prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class. However, oversampling may lead to overfitting, as the model may learn to recognize the replicated instances instead of generalizing the patterns.

3. Undersampling: Undersampling is the opposite of oversampling, where the majority class is reduced to balance the dataset. This technique helps to reduce the computational cost and time required for training the model. However, undersampling may lead to loss of important information from the majority class.

4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is diverse and representative of the population. This helps to reduce bias and improve the model's ability to generalize patterns.

5. Data augmentation: Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of the dataset by applying transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping) to the existing data. This helps to increase the variability of the dataset and prevent overfitting.

In summary, data bias is a common issue in machine learning and deep learning, and several techniques can be used to address it during preprocessing. These techniques include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection, and data augmentation. The choice of technique depends on the specific dataset and the problem at hand.
