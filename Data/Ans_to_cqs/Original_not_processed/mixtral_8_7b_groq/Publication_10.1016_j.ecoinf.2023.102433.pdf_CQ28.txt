Answer:::
The text provided does not give specific information about the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it does mention that Google's Earth Engine (GEE) is used for the analysis, and that Tensorflow, a machine learning framework developed by Google, is used for deep learning. This suggests that the model may have been deployed on the Google Cloud Platform, as this is the cloud service provided by Google. However, this is not explicitly stated in the text, so it is possible that a different platform was used. Without further information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer to this question.
