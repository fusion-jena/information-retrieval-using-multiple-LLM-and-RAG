Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly name the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for Chagas disease vector identification. However, it does mention that the researchers employed TensorFlow to train a deep learning algorithm for discriminating among Mexican and Brazilian triatomine species. The training data consisted of 405 images for Mexican triatomine species and 1,584 images for Brazilian triatomine species. These custom datasets were likely used for training and testing the deep learning model, rather than publicly available datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
