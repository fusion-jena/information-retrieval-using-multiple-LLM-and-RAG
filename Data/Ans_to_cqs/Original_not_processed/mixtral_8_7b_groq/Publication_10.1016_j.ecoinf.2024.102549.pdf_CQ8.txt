Answer:::

I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. It is common for research papers to omit specific implementation details such as code repositories, focusing more on the methodology and results. If you are interested in the specifics of the deep learning pipeline, I would recommend reaching out to the authors of the study or looking for supplementary materials they may have provided along with the paper.
