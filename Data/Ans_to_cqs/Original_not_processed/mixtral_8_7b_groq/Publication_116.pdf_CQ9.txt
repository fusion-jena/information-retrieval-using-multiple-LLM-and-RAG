Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the studies. The context consists of various papers and a table that describe different deep learning architectures and techniques used for plant identification, but there is no mention of where the data repository can be found. It is important to note that the data repository could be located in various places, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, as mentioned in the query. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer. Therefore, I would have to say that I don't know the answer to this query.
