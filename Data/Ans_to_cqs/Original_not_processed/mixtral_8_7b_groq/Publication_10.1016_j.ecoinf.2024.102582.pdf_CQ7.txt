The criteria used to split the data for training a deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that in the study, training and validation datasets were created for the random forest algorithm. The samples were randomly divided into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio. This means that 70% of the samples were used for training the model, and 30% were used for validating the model's performance.

In the context of deep learning, the data splitting criteria can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. Commonly, the data is split into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

In the provided context, it appears that the authors used a similar approach of splitting the data into training and validation sets for the random forest algorithm. However, it is not explicitly mentioned if they used a separate testing set to evaluate the final model's performance.

It is also worth noting that the data splitting criteria can have a significant impact on the model's performance. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the criteria and ensure that the data is split in a way that accurately represents the problem and provides a reliable evaluation of the model's performance.
