Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, the context does provide details about the development of a model for time series NDVI prediction incorporating climate elements in the Yellow River Basin, China.

The research framework (Fig. 2) outlines the process starting with data collection and preprocessing, followed by feature extraction and selection. The kNDVI (climate-normalized difference vegetation index) was calculated, and its trend was analyzed using a linear regression model. The significance of the trends was evaluated using the F test, and the trends were categorized into four types (Table 3).

The study used a long short-term memory (LSTM) model for time series NDVI prediction. The LSTM model was trained using the kNDVI and climate variables as inputs and the kNDVI as the output. The performance of the LSTM model was compared with other machine learning models, and the LSTM model outperformed the other models.

However, the context does not provide information on how the trained LSTM model was deployed, such as model serialization, platform selection, or model serving. Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model in a file format that can be loaded and used for making predictions. Platform selection involves choosing a platform or environment for deploying the model, such as a cloud-based platform or an edge device. Model serving is the process of making the model available as a web service or an API for making predictions.

Therefore, while the context provides details on the development of the LSTM model for time series NDVI prediction, it does not provide information on the deployment of the model.
