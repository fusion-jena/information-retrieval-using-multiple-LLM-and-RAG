Based on the provided context, there is no information about deploying a trained deep learning model. The text describes a study that analyzed YouTube videos of wild birds (called "yacho" in Japanese) to examine the relationship between the number of views and video factors such as species richness and the presence of specific bird species. The researchers extracted videos with more than 100 views, recorded the number of views as of July 16, 2022, and gathered information on video metadata, channel details, and bird species. They then used machine learning to examine the relationship between video factors and the number of views.

However, the context does not mention any steps related to deploying a deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given information.
