Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not include a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context mainly focuses on the application and potential of deep learning in ecological prediction, specifically for forecasting bark beetle outbreaks in conifer forests.

The authors, Reichstein et al., mention that they provide a reproducible example, including code and data, but they do not specify the exact location of this code repository. It is possible that the code and data are available upon request or through a different channel, such as personal communication with the authors or through the journal's website.

To find the code repository, you may consider contacting the authors directly or looking for the study's information on the Frontiers in Plant Science website, where the article was published. Additionally, you can search for the authors' names and the paper's title on popular code-sharing platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, as they might have created a repository after publication.
