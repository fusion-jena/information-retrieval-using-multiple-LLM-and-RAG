The provided context discusses a study on predictive modeling of global vegetation cover, where target labels are structurally incomplete, and various weakly supervised learning tasks are mentioned. However, the context does not provide information on data augmentation techniques typically applied in deep learning pipelines, such as flipping, rotating, and scaling.

Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size and diversity of training datasets, helping to improve model performance and prevent overfitting. These techniques create modified versions of the original training samples by applying various transformations, such as:

1. Flipping: This technique involves horizontally or vertically flipping images in the dataset. Horizontal flipping is the most common form of flipping, as it helps the model learn symmetrical features.

2. Rotating: Rotating images by a certain angle can help the model learn to recognize features at different orientations.

3. Scaling: Scaling or zooming images can help the model learn to recognize features at different scales.

4. Translation: Translating or shifting images can help the model learn to recognize features in different positions.

5. Color jittering: Changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue of images can help the model learn to recognize features under different lighting conditions or color variations.

The context provided for this answer focuses on a specific study about predictive modeling of vegetation cover with structurally incomplete target labels. It does not mention data augmentation techniques or deep learning pipelines. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an answer based on the given context.
