Answer:::
The deep learning models used in the pipeline mentioned in the context are the Hybrid CNN-LSTM model, Vision Transformer, and Wav2vec.

The Hybrid CNN-LSTM model combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. CNN excels in extracting spatial features like edges, textures, and shapes from an input, while LSTM excels in extracting temporal data, such as the order of words in a phrase or frames in a movie. By combining the two, the model can learn spatial and temporal data, making it suitable for tasks that require understanding both types of information.

The Vision Transformer is an advanced architecture that evolved from the success of transformers in natural language processing (NLP). It processes each input image as patches, which are treated as tokens by an NLP model. The model then processes the tokens to learn more about the visual representation of the input. The transformer-based results demonstrated state-of-the-art performance by processing more deep features in limited computational resources compared to CNN techniques.

Wav2vec is a state-of-the-art model for Automatic Speech Recognition and other audio-related problems. Its architecture is based on the transformer's encoder, with a training objective like BERT's masked language modelling objective but adapted for speech instead of text. The self-supervised way of training allows Wav2vec to pre-train on unlabelled data, which is more accessible. Later, the model can be fine-tuned on a particular dataset for a specific purpose.

Therefore, depending on the task and the type of data, different deep learning models are used in the pipeline.
