Answer:::
I am unable to provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline as it is not included in the given context. The first piece of context, "Navares, R., Aznarte, J.L., 2020. Predicting air quality with deep learning LSTM: Towards comprehensive models. In: Ecological Informatics, vol. 55. Elsevier BV, p. 101019. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2019.101019>.", describes a study that uses deep learning LSTM to predict air quality but does not mention or provide a link to the code repository. Similarly, the other pieces of context discuss various aspects of air quality and pollution but do not provide the requested information.
