Answer:::
The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models for image classification, specifically for identifying medicinal plants from similar poisonous plants. However, it does not give explicit information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer.

In the context, it is mentioned that the data is divided into five folds and policies are used to augment the data. A CNN model is used for processing the data, and the output of each CNN is controlled by a Bayesian optimizer. This suggests that hyperparameters were likely optimized using a Bayesian optimization method.

Furthermore, the context discusses the use of attention mechanisms, specifically four pooling operations, to enhance the performance of the proposed model. However, it does not provide information about how these attention mechanisms were implemented or the specific hyperparameters used.

In summary, while the context provides information about the overall architecture of the deep learning model and the use of attention mechanisms, it does not give explicit information about the specific hyperparameters used in the model.
