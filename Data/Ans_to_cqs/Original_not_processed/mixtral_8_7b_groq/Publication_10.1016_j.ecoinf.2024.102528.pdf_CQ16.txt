Answer:::
The provided context does not contain specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the models or algorithms mentioned. However, it is common in machine learning and deep learning practices to use validation loss plateau as a criterion for determining when training is complete. This means monitoring the loss function (a measure of error or discrepancy between predicted and actual values) on a validation dataset that is separate from the training dataset. If the loss function value stops decreasing or decreases very slowly over a certain number of epochs (iterations through the entire training dataset), the training process is considered complete. This approach helps to prevent overfitting, a situation where the model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and performs poorly on unseen data. Other criteria that might be used to determine training completion include early stopping based on a performance metric, such as accuracy, or reaching a predefined number of epochs.
