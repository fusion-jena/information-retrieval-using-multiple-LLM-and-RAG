Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about a code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. The text describes the methods and objectives of a study that used machine learning techniques, specifically Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forests (RF), to estimate net growth in Atlantic Forest fragments. However, it does not mention where the code for this pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific location for the code repository.
