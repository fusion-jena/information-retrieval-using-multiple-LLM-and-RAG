Answer:::

The data for deep learning model training is split based on the number of training images, validation images, and out-of-sample test images. The number of images for each class is different, with the 'Vole' class having the most images at 53636, while the 'Bad quality' class has the least with 6453 images.

For model training, a subset of the data is used as the training data set. In this case, the original training data set consisted of 6453 'Bad quality' images, 3382 'Bird' images, 9444 'Empty' images, and so on, totaling 53636 images.

A separate subset of the data is used as the validation data set, which is used for model validation during model training. The validation data set consisted of 677 'Bad quality' images, 219 'Bird' images, 979 'Empty' images, and so on, totaling 5364 images.

Finally, a third subset of the data is used as the out-of-sample test data set, which is used for external model validation after training is finished. The test data set consisted of 306 'Bad quality' images, 195 'Bird' images, 533 'Empty' images, and so on, totaling 3276 images.

Additionally, new images were selected from the images taken between summer 2020 and summer 2021 for model retraining. The number of new training images for each class varied, with 647 'Bad quality' images, 584 'Bird' images, 64 'Empty' images, and so on, totaling 6252 images.

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the data was split randomly or stratified based on the number of images for each class. This approach helps ensure that the model is trained, validated, and tested on a diverse set of images, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving the model's ability to generalize to new data.
