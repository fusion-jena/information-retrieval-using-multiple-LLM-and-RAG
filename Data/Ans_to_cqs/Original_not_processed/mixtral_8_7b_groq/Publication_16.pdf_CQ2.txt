Answer:
The deep learning pipeline described in the given context uses audio data as its primary input format. The acquired audio files are transmitted over 4G using SMTP and then segmented into 15-second windows. These sample windows are then passed to the feature extractor function, where Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are used to extract features from the audio data for the classifier.

There is no mention of using image, video, or CSV data formats directly in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that by combining both vision and acoustic-based data, the platform's reach can be extended into habitats where visual monitoring is not feasible. This suggests that image or video data might be used in conjunction with the audio data, but it is not clear from the provided context how this data would be integrated into the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline described in the given context primarily uses audio data in the form of audio files or audio segments. While there is a mention of using visual data for extending the platform's reach, there is no explicit description of how this data would be integrated into the deep learning pipeline.
