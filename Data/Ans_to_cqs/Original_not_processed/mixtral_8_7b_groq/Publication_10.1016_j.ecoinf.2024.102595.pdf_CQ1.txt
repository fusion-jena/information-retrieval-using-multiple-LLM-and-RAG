Answer:::
The provided text does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for oil palm yield prediction. However, it does mention that comprehensive datasets were used, which suggests that multiple sources could have been involved in the data collection process. 

These sources could include surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Surveys are a common method for collecting data directly from individuals or organizations involved in agriculture. Sensors could refer to various types of equipment used to gather data automatically, such as yield monitors, weather stations, or satellite imagery. Public datasets might include repositories of agricultural data maintained by government agencies or research institutions.

Additionally, the text mentions the use of the MinMaxScaler and LabelEncoder techniques during data preprocessing. These techniques are typically applied after the data has been collected and are used to normalize and encode the data, respectively. Therefore, while the text does not provide explicit details about the data collection methods, it is likely that a combination of primary data collection (through surveys or sensors) and secondary data collection (from public datasets) was employed.
