Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct information given about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. There are two papers mentioned from the journal Ecological Informatics, one from 2024 and another from 2022, both authored by M.S. Sarkar and colleagues (et al.). However, neither of these papers provide a link to the code repository.

It is a common practice in research to share the code used in the study to ensure reproducibility and transparency. Therefore, it is possible that the authors have shared the code in a public repository. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.

I would recommend looking up the papers themselves and checking the methodology or acknowledgments sections for any mention of a code repository. If that fails, you could try contacting the authors directly and asking for the code repository link.

So, I don't know the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
