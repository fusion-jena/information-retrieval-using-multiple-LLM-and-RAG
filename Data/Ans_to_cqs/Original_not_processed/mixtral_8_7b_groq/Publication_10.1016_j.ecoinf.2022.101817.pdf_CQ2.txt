Answer: Based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is video. The deep learning models used in this study are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are a type of neural network designed to process grid-like data, such as images or videos. In this study, the CNN models were used to classify environmental conditions based on video frames.

The study began by collecting a dataset of 1500 videos, which were then divided into a training set and a validation set. The training set was used to train the CNN models, while the validation set was used to evaluate their performance. To validate the models, one random frame was extracted from each video in the validation set, resulting in 1500 frames. These frames were then used to classify the videos into six environmental condition classes.

After completing the environmental classification phase, the system extracted a frame from each video for further processing. Image filtering/enhancement was applied to the frames before they were classified into environmental condition classes using the CNN models.

The CNN models were trained and tested using frames extracted from the training and testing dataset, which contained a total of 12,000 frames (8 frames * 1500 videos). Each of the five sets generated from the repeated random sub-sampling was split into a training/testing split of 80/20, resulting in 9600 frames for training and 2400 frames for testing.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is video.
