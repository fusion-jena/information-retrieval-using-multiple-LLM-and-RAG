Answer:

 The text does not provide explicit information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, data augmentation is a common technique used to increase the size and diversity of datasets, which can help improve the performance of deep learning models.

 Some common data augmentation techniques for image data include flipping, rotating, and scaling. Flipping involves creating new images by flipping the original image horizontally or vertically. Rotating involves creating new images by rotating the original image by a certain angle. Scaling involves creating new images by changing the size of the original image.

 In the context of the text, it is possible that data augmentation techniques were used during the preprocessing of the dataset. For example, the images in the dataset may have been resized to a specific size (e.g., (299, 299) pixels for Inception-V3, (224, 224) pixels for ResNet and ViT) and then randomly flipped or rotated to create new images.

 Additionally, the text mentions that class weights were included in the cross-entropy loss function to deal with dataset imbalance. This technique can be seen as a form of data augmentation, as it effectively increases the weight of the minority class in the loss function, making the model "see" more examples from the minority class during training.

 Therefore, while the text does not provide explicit information about the data augmentation techniques used, it is possible that common techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling were used during the preprocessing of the dataset, as well as techniques to deal with dataset imbalance.
