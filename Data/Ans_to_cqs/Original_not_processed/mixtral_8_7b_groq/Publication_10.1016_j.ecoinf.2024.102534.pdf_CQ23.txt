Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The text focuses on the development of a species distribution model for orchids in New Guinea, using an ensemble model approach, but it does not mention any steps taken to validate the model's ability to generalize to new data.

However, the text does mention that the Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metric and True Skill Statistics (TSS) were used to assess the performance of model predictions. These metrics can provide insights into the model's ability to distinguish between suitable and unsuitable areas for orchid growth.

Additionally, the model's predictions were validated using existing data, and the predictive maps were compared to estimate changes in suitable areas over time. This comparison can help identify any potential issues with the model's ability to generalize to future conditions.

It is also worth noting that the ensemble model approach used in the study can help improve the model's generalizability. By combining multiple models, the ensemble model can reduce the risk of overfitting and improve the model's ability to handle new data.

Overall, while the text does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, it does mention some steps that can provide insights into the model's ability to generalize to new data.
