Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning (DL) model in this context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the model is used for regression analysis. This is because the DL model is being compared to a random forest (RF) regression model, and the evaluation metric for comparing the models is not specified as a classification, segmentation, or detection metric.

The DL model is designed to learn complex nonlinear and multivariate mappings from inputs to outputs, making it suitable for regression problems. The model's performance was evaluated based on its ability to minimize the loss function, which is a common evaluation metric for regression problems.

Furthermore, the DL model used in this study is an artificial neural network (ANN) with a deeper network architecture, which is a common choice for regression problems. ANNs are composed of interconnected nodes or neurons that mimic the learning process of the human brain. By expanding ANNs to deep learning using deeper network architecture, the model can learn more complex mappings from inputs to outputs.

In summary, based on the information provided, the purpose of the DL model is to perform regression analysis. The model is designed to learn complex nonlinear and multivariate mappings from inputs to outputs, making it suitable for regression problems.
