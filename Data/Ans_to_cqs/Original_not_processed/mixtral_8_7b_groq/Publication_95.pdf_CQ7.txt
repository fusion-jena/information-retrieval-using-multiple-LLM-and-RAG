Answer:::

When splitting data for deep learning model training, there are important criteria to consider to ensure the effectiveness and validity of the model's performance. The data is typically split into three sets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used for optimizing the parameters of the network. This is the primary data set that the model learns from. It is crucial to have a sufficient size of the training set to capture the variability in the data and to avoid overfitting.

The validation set is used for monitoring the performance of the network during training and for comparing the performance of different networks. The validation set helps to tune the hyperparameters of the network and to ensure that the network is not overfitting to the training data. The validation set should be independent of the training set and have a similar class distribution.

The test set acts as a final evaluation of a network. After training and validating the network, the test set provides an unbiased estimate of the network's performance on new, unseen data. The test set should also be independent of the training and validation sets and have a similar class distribution.

When splitting the data, it is important to avoid information leakage between the data sets. This is especially crucial in the context of image data, where images may be captured in close proximity and potentially have overlapping fields of view. A na√Øve approach to splitting the data would be to randomly sample images from the full data set. However, due to the potential for overlapping fields of view, this may result in information leakage between the data sets.

An alternative approach to splitting the data is to consider the spatial distribution of the images. For example, in the context of the provided figure and table, the data is split according to the relative size of the annotations of each image. This approach ensures that the images in each set are independent and have similar class distributions, while also avoiding information leakage between the data sets.

In summary, when splitting data for deep learning model training, it is important to consider the following criteria:

1. Sufficient size of the training set to capture variability in the data and avoid overfitting.
2. Independence and similar class distribution of the validation and test sets.
3. Avoidance of information leakage between the data sets, especially in the context of image data.
4. Consideration of the spatial distribution of the images when splitting the data.
