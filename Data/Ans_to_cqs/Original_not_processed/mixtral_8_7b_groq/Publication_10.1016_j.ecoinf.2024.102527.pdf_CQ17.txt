Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a momentum value of Î¼ = 0.9 was used to train the model. While this is not a regularization method per se, the momentum term can help improve convergence and reduce oscillations, which could indirectly help mitigate overfitting.

In addition, the authors used different models (ResNext and ResNet) pre-trained on ImageNet, which suggests that transfer learning was employed. Transfer learning can also act as a form of implicit regularization by leveraging pre-existing knowledge from a different but related task, which can help prevent overfitting on the new task.

To further prevent overfitting, common regularization techniques such as L2 regularization, dropout, or early stopping could have been used. However, the context does not explicitly mention any of these methods. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to shrink the weights towards zero, while dropout randomly sets a fraction of the activations to zero during training, which helps prevent co-adaptation of features. Early stopping is a form of regularization where training is halted as soon as the validation loss starts to increase, preventing the model from further overfitting to the training data.

Answer:::
In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting, it is possible that transfer learning and the momentum term in the SGD optimizer were used for this purpose. However, without further information, it is not possible to definitively answer this question.
