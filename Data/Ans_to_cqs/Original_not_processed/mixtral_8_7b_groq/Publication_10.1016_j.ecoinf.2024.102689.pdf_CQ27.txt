Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involves model serialization and platform selection. 

Firstly, the model is trained using high-resolution monitoring of fish length and catch numbers from landings data. The training process utilizes Python 3.6, Pytorch version 1.8.0, and the virtual environment function of Anaconda3. The optimization is carried out using the Adam optimizer with a Momentum of 0.9 and a Batch size of 16. The images are processed at a resolution of 1024 Ã— 1024, with an initial learning rate set at 0.001 and a minimum learning rate of 0.0001. The descent mode is step, and training spans 300 epochs.

Once the model is trained, it is serialized, which means converting the model into a format that can be stored and loaded again. Model serialization allows the model to be deployed in different environments and platforms. In this case, the model is serialized to be deployed on a GPU that utilizes CUDA version 11.4.

The platform selection involves choosing a suitable hardware and software environment to deploy the model. In this case, the model is deployed on a GPU platform, which is suitable for deep learning models that require high computational power. The choice of GPU and CUDA version 11.4 ensures that the model can run efficiently and effectively.

Therefore, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involves training the model using specific parameters, serializing the model, and selecting a suitable platform for deployment. In this case, the model is trained using high-resolution fish data, serialized, and deployed on a GPU platform that utilizes CUDA version 11.4.
