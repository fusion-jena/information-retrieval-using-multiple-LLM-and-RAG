The text provided does not give a detailed description of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention some steps that can be inferred as part of the model deployment process.

Firstly, the model was built using the training set, and accuracy on the test set was used as an indicator to evaluate the performance of the classification models (Section 5.2). This implies that the model was trained and validated using a standard machine learning approach.

Secondly, the text mentions that the hardware platform used in the experiment is a desktop computer with specific configurations (Section 5.2.3). This suggests that the trained model was deployed on a local machine for testing and analysis.

Thirdly, the text mentions the use of Annaconda3, PyCharm 2020.1, Python 3.7, TensorFlow 2.6 as the deep learning platform, and MATLAB 2018b as the data processing platform (Section 5.2.3). This implies that the trained model was serialized or exported in a format that could be used by these platforms for deployment.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the model deployment process involved training and validating the model, deploying it on a local machine, and serializing or exporting it in a format that could be used by the chosen deep learning and data processing platforms. However, a more detailed description of the deployment process would be necessary to provide a more definitive answer.
