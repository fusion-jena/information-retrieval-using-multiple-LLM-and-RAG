The context provided does not give specific information about the deep learning frameworks used to build Wav2vec or Hybrid CNN-LSTM models. However, it is mentioned that Wav2vec uses a transformer's encoder architecture and the Hybrid CNN-LSTM model combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).

TensorFlow and PyTorch are two popular deep learning frameworks used for building and training neural networks. Both of these frameworks support the creation of models using transformer, CNN, and LSTM architectures.

TensorFlow, developed by Google Brain, is a powerful and flexible framework for building and training deep learning models. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources for developers. TensorFlow supports the creation of transformer, CNN, and LSTM models using its core API and Keras API.

PyTorch, developed by Facebook AI Research, is another popular deep learning framework known for its simplicity and ease of use. It has a dynamic computation graph, which makes it more flexible for research purposes compared to TensorFlow. PyTorch provides built-in modules for creating transformer, CNN, and LSTM models, making it convenient for developers to build and train deep learning models.

Given that Wav2vec and Hybrid CNN-LSTM models use transformer, CNN, and LSTM architectures, it is highly likely that they were built using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. However, the context does not provide specific information on this matter.
