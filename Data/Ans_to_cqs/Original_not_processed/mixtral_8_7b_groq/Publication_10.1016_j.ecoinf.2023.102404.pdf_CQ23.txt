The text provided does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the tuning of parameters for a machine learning model, specifically an ensemble of decision trees. However, I can still address the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of this machine learning model.

Answer:::
To ensure the generalizability of the machine learning model, several measures were taken. First, a grid search was performed to optimize the model's hyperparameters. The grid search exhaustively tested all possible combinations of potential values for the parameters 'numberOfTrees', 'minLeafPopulation', 'bagFraction', and 'seed'. This method allowed for the identification of the best combination of parameters that minimized the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and resulted in the most accurate predictions.

Second, cross-validation techniques were employed during the evaluation of the model's performance. Cross-validation is a powerful method to assess the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. It reduces overfitting and provides a more reliable estimation of the model's performance.

Third, the training dataset was created using a stratified random sampling approach. This technique aimed to ensure that the training/testing dataset accurately represented the distribution of AGB (Above-Ground Biomass) values within the LiDAR-derived AGB maps. By capturing the full distribution of AGB values, the model was exposed to a diverse dataset, which further enhanced its ability to generalize.

Lastly, the 'seed' parameter was included in the grid search. This parameter controlled the random selection of half of the pixels for the training and testing split. By tuning the seed, the authors ensured that the training/testing split was consistent and reproducible, allowing for a fair evaluation of the model's performance.

In summary, although the text does not mention deep learning, the described measures—grid search, cross-validation, stratified random sampling, and reproducible training/testing split—contribute to the generalizability of the machine learning model.
