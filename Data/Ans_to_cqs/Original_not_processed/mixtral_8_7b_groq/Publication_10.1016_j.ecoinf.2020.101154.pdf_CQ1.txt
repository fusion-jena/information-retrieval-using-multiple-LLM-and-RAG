Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific details about the data collection methods used in the deep learning pipeline for herring growth analysis. However, it does provide information about some of the data sources and preprocessing techniques used.

The data used in the study appears to come from a combination of sources, including the ICES Herring Assessment Working Group (HAWG) reports from 2014 and 2015, as well as historical reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data from the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the MET Office Hadley Centre. The SST data is derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and in-situ observations, and is provided through the Hydrax/OpenDAP server.

The ICES HAWG reports likely contain data collected through various fisheries-independent and fisheries-dependent methods, such as acoustic surveys, trawl surveys, and catch data from commercial fisheries. However, the specific methods used are not mentioned in the provided context.

In terms of data preprocessing, the context mentions that individual observations were grouped according to year of capture and randomly selected for inclusion in the train and test datasets. This approach is commonly used in machine learning to ensure that the model is tested using previously unseen combinations of explanatory variables.

Additionally, the context mentions that Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) were used as a learning algorithm to find patterns in the data. GBRT is a popular machine learning method for regression and classification tasks, and it can handle both numerical and categorical data.

Overall, while the provided context does not give specific details about the data collection methods used in the study, it does suggest that a combination of fisheries-independent and fisheries-dependent data sources were used, along with remote sensing data and machine learning techniques for data analysis.
