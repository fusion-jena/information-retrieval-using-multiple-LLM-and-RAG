Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, there are some clues that suggest possible methods that might have been used.

Firstly, the context mentions the use of environmental covariates for mapping the environmental space to the geographic space. This implies that the dataset used in the study likely includes a diverse range of environmental variables, which could help in creating a more generalizable model.

Secondly, the context mentions the use of two indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of each model in correcting sampling bias. While this is not a direct measure of generalizability, it does suggest that some form of model evaluation was performed, which could include techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting.

Cross-validation is a commonly used technique for evaluating the performance and generalizability of machine learning models. It involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, or folds, and training the model on all but one of these folds while testing it on the remaining fold. This process is then repeated for each fold, providing an estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.

Stratified splitting is another technique that could have been used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. This involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain criteria, such as class labels or geographical regions, and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to create the training and testing sets. This can help ensure that the model is exposed to a diverse range of data and is not overfitting to any particular subset of the data.

Overall, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, there are some indications that these techniques may have been used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
