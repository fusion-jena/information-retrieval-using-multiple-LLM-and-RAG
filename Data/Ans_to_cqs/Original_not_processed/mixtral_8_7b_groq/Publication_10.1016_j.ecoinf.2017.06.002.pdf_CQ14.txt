The provided context does not include information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text focuses on the organization and description of data, including the importance of transparent processing approaches and the integration of data with models. It also includes details about the structure of measurement data, such as installation details, measurement positions, and data files.

However, the optimization of hyperparameters is a process that typically takes place during the training of machine learning models and is not directly related to the organization and description of data. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
