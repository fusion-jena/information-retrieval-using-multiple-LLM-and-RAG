The provided context discusses the use of Elastic Net as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in a deep learning model for fish classification using DNA barcode sequences. Elastic Net is a linear combination of L1 and L2 regularization, which encourages the model to have a sparse representation by adding a penalty term to the loss function.

Elastic Net is used to solve the overfitting problem caused by the small dataset due to the limited number of species in the family. It improves the generalization ability of the proposed model, which is a deep learning model for extracting useful features and classifying fish from different families.

The context also mentions the use of an EN-SAE (Elastic Net Stacked Autoencoder) model to receive the outgroup scores, and the decision threshold is automatically learned by the KDE (Kernel Density Estimation) technique. This approach is proposed as a novel predictor for fish classification, while other classification studies often omit the importance of automatic learning threshold.

In summary, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline in the provided context is Elastic Net. It is used to improve the generalization ability of the proposed model for fish classification using DNA barcode sequences.
