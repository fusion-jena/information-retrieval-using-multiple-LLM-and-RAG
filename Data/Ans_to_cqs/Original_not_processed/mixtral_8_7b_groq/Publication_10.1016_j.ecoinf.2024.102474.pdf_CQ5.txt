Answer:::

The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the study are not explicitly mentioned as being MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the study utilizes a specific dataset provided as part of the EarthNet2021 Challenge. This dataset consists of 23,904 training datacubes located across Europe, with each datacube containing information about vegetation and other environmental factors. The authors use this dataset to train and test their deep learning models for predicting vegetation responses to extreme drought.

The dataset includes Sentinel-2 satellite data, which provides information about various vegetation indices, such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). The authors use this data in combination with a ConvLSTM (Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory) network, a type of machine learning model that can handle sequential data, to predict vegetation responses to drought.

Therefore, while the study does not use the standard deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it employs a different dataset specifically tailored to the task of predicting vegetation responses to drought.
