Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training in the study titled "Not seeing the forest for the trees: Generalised linear model out-performs random forest in species distribution modelling for Southeast Asian felids" involves the use of two different training data selection frameworks for both Generalised Linear Model (GLM) and Random Forest (RF) approaches. 

For the GLM, the model performance is monitored by calculating the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), Percent Correctly Classified (PCC), sensitivity, specificity, and True Skill Statistic (TSS) using a separate dataset composed of 20% of the camera traps that were not used in the training dataset. 

On the other hand, for the RF, the model performance is monitored by using the same training dataset used for the non-bootstrapped GLM, composed of randomly selected 80% of camera trap locations. The species distribution probability surfaces for each felid are produced, and the Out-Of-Bag (OOB) error is calculated for each covariate using univariate Random Forest. The scale with the lowest OOB error is then selected for each covariate.

Furthermore, for the bootstrapped GLM, the model performance is monitored by calculating AUC, PCC, sensitivity, specificity, and TSS for each of the 100 iterations using the data retained from the model training, composed of 80% of the presence and absence locations. The final metrics are obtained by averaging the results of the 100 validation iterations. This framework is implemented independently for each felid.

In summary, the study implemented a rigorous strategy to monitor the model performance during training for both GLM and RF approaches. The GLM model performance is monitored using a separate dataset composed of 20% of the camera traps, while the RF model performance is monitored using the OOB error calculated for each covariate. Additionally, the bootstrapped GLM model performance is monitored by calculating the validation metrics for each of the 100 iterations and averaging the results.
