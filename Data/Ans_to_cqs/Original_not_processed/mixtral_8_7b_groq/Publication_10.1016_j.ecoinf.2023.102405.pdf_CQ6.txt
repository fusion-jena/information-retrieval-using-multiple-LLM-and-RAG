Answer:::

In the context provided, the data pre-processing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as the AODEGRU model, include data cleaning and potentially other processes like normalization or scaling. 

Data cleaning is a significant aspect of data pre-processing as mentioned in the first piece of context. It involves identifying and removing incomplete or inaccurate records to ensure the dataset's accuracy. This is crucial for any deep learning model as the reliability and integrity of data directly impact the model's performance.

While the text does not explicitly mention normalization or scaling, these are common practices in preparing data for deep learning models. Normalization is the process of rescaling numeric data to a common range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling, on the other hand, might refer to adjusting the range of features to have similar scales, which can help some algorithms converge faster and perform better. 

In the second piece of context, there is no direct reference to data pre-processing steps. However, it does detail the training process for the AODEGRU model once the data has been prepared.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can infer that data cleaning is a necessary preprocessing step before training the AODEGRU model. Other common steps like normalization or scaling may also be involved but are not explicitly mentioned in the text.
