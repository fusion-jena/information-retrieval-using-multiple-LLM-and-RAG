Based on the provided context, there is no information about the data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline for analyzing the urban acoustic environment (AE). The context discusses various methods used for quantifying and analyzing the urban AE, such as fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering, sound event classification using machine learning approaches, and complex network analysis. However, it does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, which are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size and variability of training datasets.

Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
