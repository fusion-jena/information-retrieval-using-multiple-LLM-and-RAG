The provided context does not include specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for fish grading or freshness detection. However, it does mention that the research involves machine learning experiments using organoleptic parameters and six different fish species.

In general, data annotation techniques for deep learning in computer vision tasks can include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in an image. It is a simple and efficient way to label objects and is often used for object detection tasks.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel of an object in an image, creating a segmented mask for each instance of the object. It is a more precise method than bounding box annotation and is used for tasks such as semantic segmentation and object segmentation.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling pixels in an image according to their semantic class, such as "fish" or "background". It is used for scene understanding and image analysis tasks.
4. Keypoint annotation: This technique involves labeling specific points or landmarks on an object, such as the eyes and mouth of a fish. It is used for tasks such as facial recognition and pose estimation.

The choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the desired output. For fish grading or freshness detection, instance segmentation or semantic segmentation could be used to label individual fish or fish parts, while bounding box annotation could be used for detecting the presence of fish in an image.

In summary, while the provided context does not specify the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for fish grading or freshness detection, common techniques for computer vision tasks include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and keypoint annotation. The choice of technique depends on the specific task and desired output.
