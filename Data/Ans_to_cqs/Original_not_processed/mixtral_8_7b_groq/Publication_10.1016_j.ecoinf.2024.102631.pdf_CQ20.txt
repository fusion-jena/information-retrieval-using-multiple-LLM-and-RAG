The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the network follows a fully convolutional design, which involves applying 2D convolutions using 4 Ã— 4 filters. This type of operation is computationally intensive and typically benefits from the parallel processing capabilities of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Therefore, it can be inferred that either GPUs or TPUs were likely used to train this deep learning model, but the exact details are not provided in the context.
