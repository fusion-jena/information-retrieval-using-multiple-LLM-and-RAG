Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on discussing the model, its advantages, limitations, and future work, as well as summarizing the main findings.

However, it does mention the use of "reasonable data and computational requirements" and the collection of "diverse data" for flood pulse modeling. Although not explicitly stated as preprocessing techniques for bias reduction, these practices can contribute to reducing data bias.

Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are common techniques for handling data bias. Stratified splitting ensures that the train and test datasets have a similar distribution of classes. Oversampling and undersampling are used to balance the class distribution in the dataset. Oversampling replicates instances from the minority class, while undersampling reduces instances from the majority class.

Given the lack of specific information in the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer. However, it is possible that the authors used some of these techniques or others not mentioned here.

Answer:::
There is no explicit information in the provided context about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. While the text mentions the use of reasonable data and diverse data collection, it does not specify any preprocessing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling.
