Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text includes details about the study's ecological informatics, the locations and dates of acoustic data collection, and the CRediT authorship contribution statement. However, it does not mention where the code repository is hosted, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide the specific location of the code repository.
