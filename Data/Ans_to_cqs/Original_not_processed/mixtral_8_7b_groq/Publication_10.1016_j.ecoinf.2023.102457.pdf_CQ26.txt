The provided context discusses the use of deep learning for bioacoustic applications, specifically for gibbon vocalization analysis, but it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. However, it does touch upon some related concepts that are often used to address data bias, such as diverse data collection and the use of pre-trained models.

Answer:::
While the provided context does not directly answer the query, it is still important to address data bias in deep learning projects. Some techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria (such as class distribution) and then randomly sampling from these subgroups to create training, validation, and test sets. This ensures that each set has a similar distribution of samples, reducing bias.

2. Oversampling: When certain classes are underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to increase the number of samples from these classes. This can be done by duplicating existing samples or by using techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to create new synthetic samples.

3. Undersampling: Alternatively, when certain classes are overrepresented in the dataset, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of samples from these classes. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of samples from the overrepresented classes.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting a diverse dataset that represents various demographics, scenarios, and conditions can help reduce bias in the model. This includes collecting data from different geographical locations, varying environmental conditions, and including samples from different demographic groups.

5. Pre-trained models: Using pre-trained models, like the pre-trained BirdNET model mentioned in the context, can help reduce bias by leveraging existing knowledge from a larger, more diverse dataset. These models can be fine-tuned on the specific task and dataset, allowing the model to benefit from the diverse data used to train the pre-trained model.

In the context provided, the researchers used pre-trained models and a dataset of gibbon vocalizations to extract embeddings for individual gibbon discrimination. While they do not explicitly mention techniques to address data bias, using a pre-trained model and potentially collecting a diverse dataset of gibbon vocalizations could help reduce bias in their study.
