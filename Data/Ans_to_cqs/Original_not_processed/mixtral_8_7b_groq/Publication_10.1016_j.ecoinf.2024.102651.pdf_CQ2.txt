Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the text is images. The study presents experimental results on the classification of microorganisms and Cervidae (a type of deer) using deep learning models. The models are trained and tested on image datasets, with the images likely being in a format such as JPEG or PNG.

The models used in the study include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), ViT (Vision Transformer), and ResNet (Residual Network). These models are commonly used for image classification tasks, and they take images as input. CNNs are known for their ability to extract local features from images, while ViT primarily extracts features from a spatial perspective. The combination of CAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) and ViT enables the network to better learn image features. ResNet, on the other hand, has a residual structure that connects different network layers via shortcuts, preserving input features and addressing the degradation problem of deep networks.

Therefore, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the text is images. The study uses various deep learning models to classify microorganisms and Cervidae based on image datasets.
