Answer:::

The provided context discusses the training of deep learning models for object detection in ecological studies, specifically for detecting animals in aerial imagery. However, it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training the models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer based on the given context.

However, I can provide a general overview of common preprocessing steps involved in training deep learning models:

1. Data cleaning: This step involves removing or correcting erroneous data points that can negatively impact model performance. For images, this might include removing corrupt or irrelevant images from the dataset.

2. Data augmentation: This technique is used to increase the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing images, such as rotation, scaling, flipping, or cropping. This helps improve the model's ability to generalize and handle variations in the input data.

3. Normalization: This step involves scaling the input data to a common range, often between 0 and 1, to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model's learning process. For images, this typically involves dividing each pixel value by 255 (since pixel values usually range from 0 to 255).

4. Resizing: Deep learning models typically require a fixed input size. Therefore, images need to be resized to match the input dimensions of the model. Care should be taken to avoid distorting the aspect ratio of the images during resizing.

5. Feature extraction: In some cases, it might be beneficial to extract features from the images before training the model. This can be done using various techniques, such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) or Local Binary Patterns (LBP).

While the provided context does not mention these specific preprocessing steps, it is possible that some or all of these steps were applied in the training process. It is essential to consider these preprocessing steps when training deep learning models, as they can significantly impact model performance.
