Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are a few relevant sections that could potentially touch on this topic.

Firstly, in section 4.3. Data processing, the authors mention the use of "optimal segmentation scale for different parameter factors at small scales" (EcologicalInformatics77(2023)1022424Shape: 0.5 Compactness: 0.5 Shape: 0.4 Compactness: 0.5 Shape: 0.5 Compactness: 0.6 Shape: 0.4 Compactness: 0.6). This could imply that the authors have considered the impact of different scales and parameters on the model's performance, which is a step towards ensuring generalizability.

Secondly, in section 4.4. Classification method, the authors mention the need to "refine the subsequent classification process" and "focus on this issue to yield more reliable results" in future research. This suggests that the authors are aware of the importance of improving the model's reliability and robustness, which are crucial aspects of generalizability.

However, these sections do not provide concrete evidence of the use of specific techniques such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.

Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. While there are some indications that the authors have considered the impact of different scales and parameters on the model's performance, and are aware of the importance of improving the model's reliability and robustness, there is no mention of the use of techniques such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, the answer to the query is: there is no information available in the given context regarding the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
