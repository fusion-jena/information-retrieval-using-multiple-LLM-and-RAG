The provided context does not contain information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context mainly focuses on the use of machine learning techniques, specifically the classical random forest method, for predicting infectious diseases. It discusses the implementation of two feature elimination techniques, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF), to enhance the precision of the random forest method. However, it does not mention any optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
