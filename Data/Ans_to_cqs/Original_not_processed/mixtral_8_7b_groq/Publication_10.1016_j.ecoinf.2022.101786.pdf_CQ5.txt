The context provided does not specify the exact names of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that manual annotations were used to generate training, validation, and testing datasets. These datasets were generated from a collection of marine images. Therefore, the datasets used in this specific deep learning pipeline are not standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, but rather custom datasets created from marine image annotations.
