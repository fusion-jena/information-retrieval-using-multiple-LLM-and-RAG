Answer: The deep learning pipeline described in the text involves the use of video files in the training and evaluation of a neural network model for hummingbird detection. The videos are first processed for motion detection, and the resulting frames are then passed to the neural network for classification. Therefore, the primary data format used in this pipeline is video. However, it is important to note that the neural network itself likely works with image data, as each frame of the video would be treated as a separate image during classification. Additionally, the feature extraction process for the fixed inception layers is performed using image data, as evidenced by the use of Google Cloud DataFlow for parallel extraction of features from images. Therefore, both video and image data formats are used in this deep learning pipeline. There is no mention of audio or CSV data formats being used in this pipeline.
