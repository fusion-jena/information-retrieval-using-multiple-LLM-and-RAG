Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of the Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm for identifying the optimal hyperparameters of machine learning and deep learning models in the context of river quality assessment. However, it does not specify the exact hyperparameters that were optimized for the deep learning models used in the study.

In general, hyperparameters for deep learning models can include learning rate, number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each layer, activation functions, batch size, number of epochs, optimizer, regularization techniques, and dropout rate, among others.

The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls how much the weights in the model are adjusted during training. The optimizer is a hyperparameter that determines the algorithm used to find the minimum of the loss function. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.

The number of hidden layers and number of neurons in each layer are hyperparameters that determine the complexity of the model. Activation functions are used to introduce non-linearity into the model. Batch size is a hyperparameter that determines the number of samples used in each update of the weights during training. The number of epochs is a hyperparameter that determines the number of times the entire training dataset is used during training.

Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, are used to prevent overfitting. Dropout rate is a hyperparameter used in regularization to randomly drop out neurons during training to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, while the specific hyperparameters that were optimized for the deep learning models used in the study are not provided, it is clear that the TPE algorithm was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the deep learning models used in the study. The hyperparameters that were optimized could include any of the aforementioned hyperparameters, or others, depending on the specific deep learning models used in the study.
