Answer:::
The postprocessing steps involved after the model training, as inferred from the given context, include the classification of new images, validation of the model's performance, and the calculation of metrics. 

In the classification phase, the trained CNN-based model is used to classify 396 new images with different tree cover in global drylands. The model classifies these images into one of the four classes: Open Forest, Closed Forest, Dense Forest, or Non-Forest. 

Following the classification, the model's performance is assessed in the validation phase. However, the specifics of this phase are not provided in the context. It can be assumed that standard validation methods, such as the calculation of a confusion matrix, are used. 

A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model on a set of test data for which the true values are known. It allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm and can be used to calculate various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 

The context does not mention the use of techniques like Saliency maps, which are often used in postprocessing to visualize the parts of the input that most influenced the decision of a deep learning model. 

In summary, the postprocessing steps after the model training, as inferred from the given context, include the classification of new images, validation of the model's performance, and the calculation of metrics, possibly including a confusion matrix. However, the use of other techniques like Saliency maps is not mentioned.
