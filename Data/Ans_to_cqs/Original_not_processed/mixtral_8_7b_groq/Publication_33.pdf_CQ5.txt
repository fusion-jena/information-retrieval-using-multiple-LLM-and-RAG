Answer: The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the scientific report are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that the authors built their own dataset for training and testing their convolutional neural network (CNN) model and post-processing method. They used three independent fish image datasets from the Mayotte Island in the Western Indian Ocean, extracted from 175 underwater high-definition videos. These videos were recorded in 1920 Ã— 1,080 pixels with GoPro Hero 3 + black and Hero 4 + black cameras, at depths between 2 and 30 meters, with varying luminosity, transparency, and benthic environment conditions.

Additionally, the report mentions other datasets in the context of related work. For instance, it cites the MNIST dataset as an example of a dataset used for training and testing machine learning models. The MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The report also mentions the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets, which are collections of images used for object recognition research. ImageNet, another dataset frequently used in deep learning, is also mentioned in the report.

In summary, while the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the scientific report are not explicitly stated, the authors used three independent fish image datasets from the Mayotte Island. The report also references other datasets commonly used in deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, in the context of related work.
