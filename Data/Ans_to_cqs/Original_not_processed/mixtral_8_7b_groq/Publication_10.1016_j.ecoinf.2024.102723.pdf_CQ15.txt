Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in the given context uses the Adam optimization technique. The Adam optimizer is a popular choice for training deep learning models due to its efficiency and effectiveness. It is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm, which means that it adjusts the learning rate based on the parameters' historical gradient information. This adaptability makes it well-suited for complex optimization problems often encountered in deep learning.

In the context provided, the Adam optimizer is used in the MCD (Monte Carlo Dropout) network, which is designed for uncertainty quantification in deep learning. The MCD network has two fully-connected hidden layers with 32 nodes each, using 'ReLU' (Rectified Linear Unit) as the activation function. The optimizer is set to Adam, and the starting learning rate is 0.001.

The deep learning pipeline also involves building and training neural networks from scratch using TensorFlow (tf) and Keras. These tools offer a seamless and user-friendly approach to building, training, and deploying deep learning models. The Adam optimizer is a part of the optimization process when using these frameworks.

It is important to note that the context does not mention any other optimization techniques, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). While SGD is a fundamental optimization algorithm in machine learning, the given context specifically focuses on the Adam optimizer in the deep learning pipeline.
