Answer:

The provided context does not include a direct link to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline for underwater image analysis, specifically for coral reefs. However, based on the information available, it can be inferred that the authors have used various deep learning models such as ResNet50, GoogLeNet, and AlexNet, along with traditional handcrafted descriptors for feature extraction.

One possible approach to access the code repository would be to contact the authors directly using the details available in the papers. For instance, the authors of the paper titled "Automatic image captioning based on ResNet50 and LSTM with soft attention" have provided their email addresses in the paper.

Another approach would be to search for the code repositories on popular platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, using relevant keywords such as "deep learning for underwater image analysis," "coral reef classification using deep learning," or "AlexNet for coral reef classification."

It is worth noting that creating a deep learning pipeline for underwater image analysis involves several steps, including data collection, preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. Therefore, even if the code repository is available, it may require a certain level of expertise in deep learning and image processing to implement and customize it for specific use cases.
