Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context mainly focuses on the experiments' training/test sets sizes, precision results, and the initial experiments' evaluation. However, it does mention some metrics that were calculated during the evaluation of the models, such as precision.

Precision is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives. In the provided Table 3, precision results are given for each experiment (E1 and E2) and for each pose (Upper, Left, and Right) across four measures (P1, P3, P5, and P6).

Additionally, the context also mentions that some unclear images were removed prior to the training, which could be considered a part of the preprocessing steps.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps after the model training include the calculation of precision as a metric for evaluation. However, there is no information about other postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps or Confusion matrix.

Answer::: The postprocessing steps involved after the model training, as mentioned in the provided context, include the calculation of precision as a metric for evaluation. However, there is no information about other postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps or Confusion matrix.
