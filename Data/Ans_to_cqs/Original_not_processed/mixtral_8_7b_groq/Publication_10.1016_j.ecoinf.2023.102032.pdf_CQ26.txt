Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the data was collected and processed in a way that the overall proportion of the complete dataset is representative of land use classes in the study area. It is also stated that the plot locations are presented in Fig. 4, which could imply that a diverse data collection technique was used.

In general, when dealing with data bias in a deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be used during the preprocessing phase to ensure that the model is trained on a representative and unbiased dataset. Some of these techniques include:

1. Stratified sampling: This technique involves dividing the dataset into strata based on the class labels and then randomly sampling from each stratum. This ensures that each class is represented in the training, validation, and test sets in approximately the same proportions as they appear in the original dataset.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class in the dataset. This can be done either by randomly duplicating instances of the minority class or by generating synthetic instances using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class in the dataset. This can be done either by randomly removing instances of the majority class or by using techniques such as NearMiss to select a representative subset of the majority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population being studied. This can help to reduce bias and improve the generalizability of the model.

Without more information about the specific preprocessing techniques used in the study, it is difficult to provide a more specific answer to the query. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that some effort was made to ensure that the dataset was representative of the study area.
