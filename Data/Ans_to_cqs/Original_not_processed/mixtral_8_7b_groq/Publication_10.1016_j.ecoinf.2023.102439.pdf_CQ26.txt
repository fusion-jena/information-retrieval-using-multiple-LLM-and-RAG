The provided context discusses the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and hybrid methodologies in remote sensing and environmental analysis, but it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the importance of understanding data characteristics and implementing effective preparation techniques such as feature selection through stepwise regression and principal component analysis.

In the context of addressing data bias, the following techniques could be used during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline:

1. **Stratified splitting**: This technique involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain characteristics, and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to ensure that the training, validation, and test sets have similar distributions of these characteristics. This can help to ensure that the model is trained on a representative sample of the data and is not biased towards certain subgroups.
2. **Oversampling**: This technique involves increasing the number of examples in a subgroup that is underrepresented in the data. This can help to ensure that the model is trained on a more balanced sample of the data and is not biased towards the majority class.
3. **Undersampling**: This technique involves decreasing the number of examples in a subgroup that is overrepresented in the data. This can help to ensure that the model is trained on a more balanced sample of the data and is not biased towards the majority class.
4. **Diverse data collection**: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population or phenomenon being studied. This can help to ensure that the model is trained on a diverse and unbiased sample of the data.

It is important to note that the choice of technique will depend on the specific characteristics of the data and the problem being studied. Additionally, it is important to carefully evaluate the performance of the model on a representative test set to ensure that it is not biased towards certain subgroups or classes.
