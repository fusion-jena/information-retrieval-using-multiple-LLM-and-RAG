Answer:::
The performance of the deep learning model, IUC-NN, is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, positive predictive value (which can be considered as precision), and negative predictive value (which can be considered as recall). 

The model's accuracy is reported as the percentage of correct predictions out of all predictions made. It gives an overall idea of how well the model is performing. The IUC-NN model achieved a test accuracy of 84.3% when considering binary threat levels and using only geographic features.

Positive predictive value, or precision, is the ratio of true positive predictions (species correctly identified as threatened) to the total predicted positives (all species identified as threatened). It provides an understanding of the model's performance in identifying threatened species. The IUC-NN model achieved a positive predictive value of 88% under the same conditions as its highest accuracy.

Negative predictive value, or recall, is the ratio of true negative predictions (species correctly identified as not threatened) to the total predicted negatives (all species identified as not threatened). It gives an insight into the model's ability to correctly identify species that are not threatened. The IUC-NN model achieved a negative predictive value of 79% under the same conditions as its highest accuracy.

Additionally, the model's performance is also evaluated using cross-entropy loss, which is a measure of the difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual labels. Lower cross-entropy loss indicates better performance. The IUC-NN model with the lowest cross-entropy loss across a range of models was used for the final predictions.
