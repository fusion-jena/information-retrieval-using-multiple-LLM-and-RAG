The provided context discusses various models and methods used for predicting groundwater (GW) salinity hazard maps, but it does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization.

However, it does mention the use of the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) method, which is a machine learning method that helps prevent overfitting by developing a model based on predictive subsets and estimating each data subset individually. RFE ultimately obtains their values by selecting their characteristics and examining the most significant predictors while attempting to eliminate all dependencies, collinearities, and less significant predictors.

While RFE is not a regularization method like dropout or L2 regularization, it is a method that helps prevent overfitting by selecting the most relevant features for the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, it does discuss a method (RFE) that helps prevent overfitting by selecting the most relevant features for the model.
