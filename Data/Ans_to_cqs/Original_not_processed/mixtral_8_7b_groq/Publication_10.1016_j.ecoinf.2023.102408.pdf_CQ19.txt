Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model are not mentioned. The text discusses the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for modeling complex phenomena and developing nonlinear regression. It also explains how an ANN fitted with CARET is a single hidden-layer neural network with two hyperparameters: size and decay. However, it does not specify whether frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or others were used to build and train the ANN. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
