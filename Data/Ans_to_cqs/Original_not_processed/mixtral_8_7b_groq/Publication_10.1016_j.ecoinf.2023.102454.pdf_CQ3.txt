The provided context does not include information about data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. The context focuses on data sources and contributors for a specific study related to carbon emissions in China.

However, I can provide a brief overview of some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning, particularly for computer vision tasks:

1. **Bounding box annotation**: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in an image. It helps deep learning models to locate and classify objects within the image. Bounding box annotation is commonly used for object detection tasks.

2. **Instance segmentation**: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image according to the object it belongs to. It provides a more precise representation of object boundaries compared to bounding box annotation. Instance segmentation is useful for tasks that require detailed understanding of object shapes, such as semantic segmentation and image recognition.

3. **Semantic segmentation**: In this technique, pixels are grouped into semantically meaningful regions. Unlike instance segmentation, semantic segmentation does not differentiate between instances of the same class. It is often used for scene understanding, autonomous driving, and medical image analysis.

4. **Class labeling**: This is the simplest form of data annotation, where objects in an image are assigned class labels without specifying their exact location or shape. Class labeling is useful for image classification tasks.

5. **Key point annotation**: In this technique, specific points of interest are annotated in an image, such as joints in human bodies for pose estimation.

These are some of the common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. The choice of annotation technique depends on the specific task and the desired level of detail in object representation.
