In the context of predicting water quality parameters using hyperspectral data and deep learning algorithms, there are several methods used for collecting raw data. These methods can be categorized into laboratory experiments, aerial or orbital sensing, and satellite imagery.

In laboratory experiments, researchers collect water samples and measure their biophysical properties. For instance, Novo et al., 1991, conducted a laboratory experiment relating spectral reflectance to total suspended solids. Similarly, Pechar, 1987, used an acetone: methanol mixture for the extraction and spectrophotometric determination of chlorophyll-a in phytoplankton. These experiments provide ground truth data for developing and validating machine learning models.

Aerial or orbital sensing involves collecting hyperspectral data using sensors mounted on aircraft or satellites. Olmanson et al., 2013, used airborne hyperspectral remote sensing to assess the spatial distribution of water quality characteristics in large rivers, specifically the Mississippi River and its tributaries in Minnesota. Pyo et al., 2018, used airborne hyperspectral imagery for high-spatial resolution monitoring of phycocyanin and chlorophyll-a. These methods allow for large-scale data collection over extensive areas and can provide information on the spatial distribution of water quality parameters.

Satellite imagery is another source of hyperspectral data. Public datasets derived from satellite imagery, such as Landsat, are often used in deep learning pipelines for water quality prediction. Peterson et al., 2018, estimated suspended sediment concentration from Landsat imagery along the lower Missouri and middle Mississippi rivers using an extreme learning machine. These datasets are publicly available and can be used to develop machine learning models for various water quality parameters.

In summary, raw data for deep learning pipelines in water quality prediction can be collected using laboratory experiments, aerial or orbital sensing, and satellite imagery. These methods provide the necessary data for developing and validating machine learning models for predicting water quality parameters using hyperspectral data and deep learning algorithms.
