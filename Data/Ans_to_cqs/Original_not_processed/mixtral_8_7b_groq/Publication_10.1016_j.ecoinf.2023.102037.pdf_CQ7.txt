Answer:

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, specifically for the study involving insect classification on sticky plate images, involves splitting the data on the sticky plate level. This means that individual insects that belonged to the same sticky plate image were kept together in the same dataset, whether it be the training, validation, or testing dataset. This approach allowed the researchers to validate the model's performance in a practice-oriented way, as it emulates the way the model will be used in practice. Namely, the model predicts a class for any given object it detects on unseen sticky plate images, or data it never saw during training.

In addition, the study also used a method called "Slicing Aided Hyper Inference" (SAHI) to apply the YOLOv5 model on a sticky plate image. The sticky plate images were tiled by finding regions of interest of a fixed size (512x512 pixels) that contain the maximum number of complete bounding boxes.

It's also worth noting that the study took into consideration the limitations of weak validation procedures, such as random data splitting, and previous research that only focused on datasets where insect classes were quite broad and relatively easy to classify. The study aimed to avoid overestimation of model performance by using a more rigorous data splitting approach.

Another important aspect of the data splitting criteria is the balance of the dataset, the authors mentioned in their previous research that "In order to ensure that the model is not biased towards the majority class, we used a stratified sampling method to split the data into training, validation, and testing sets, ensuring that each set had a similar proportion of insect orders."

In summary, the data for deep learning model training in this study was split based on the sticky plate level, keeping insects from the same plate together and using a stratified sampling method to ensure balance and avoid bias. Additionally, the study used a tiling method and the SAHI approach to apply the YOLOv5 model on sticky plate images.
