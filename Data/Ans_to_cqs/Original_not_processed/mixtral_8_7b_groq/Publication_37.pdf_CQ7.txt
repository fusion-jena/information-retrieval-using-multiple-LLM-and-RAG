Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of a validation set to identify the best training epoch for the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, but it does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data into training, validation, and test sets. However, it can be inferred that the data was divided into a training set and a validation set for the purpose of identifying the best training epoch, and the remaining data was likely used as a test set to evaluate the final model performance.

During the training of the CNN model, the data was divided into a training set and a validation set. Specifically, one of the four training folds was used as a validation set, and the remaining three folds were used as the training set. This approach is known as k-fold cross-validation, where the data is divided into k folds, and the model is trained and validated k times, with each fold serving as the validation set once. This method helps to reduce overfitting and provides a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

Additionally, the context mentions that a separate dataset, referred to as the CLO-43SD dataset, was divided into five folds for the purpose of performing 5-fold cross-validation and reporting the results as a box-plot generated from the per-fold accuracies. However, it is not clear from the provided context whether this dataset was used for training the deep learning models or if it was used solely for evaluating the model performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it can be inferred that the data was divided into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set and validation set were used during the training of the CNN model, and the test set was used to evaluate the final model performance. The CLO-43SD dataset was divided into five folds for the purpose of performing 5-fold cross-validation, but it is not clear whether it was used for training or evaluating the deep learning models.
