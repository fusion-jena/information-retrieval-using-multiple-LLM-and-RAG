The provided context does not contain information about the specific deep learning model used in the pipeline. The text focuses on the comparison of permafrost models using various input parameters and their types (equilibrium, analytical, numerical, empirical, and statistical). Therefore, I cannot provide an answer regarding the type of deep learning model used in this case.
