The provided context does not contain information about deep learning pipelines, data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Instead, it includes several papers and reports about ecological informatics and wildlife management areas in Mississippi.

The first two pieces of context are from a paper titled "Ecological informatics: A review and prospect" by G. Wang and X. Shan, published in the journal Ecological Informatics in 2024. However, this paper does not discuss data augmentation techniques in deep learning pipelines.

The remaining pieces of context are reports from the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks about wildlife management areas harvest summary from 1983 to 2005. These reports do not contain any information about data augmentation techniques or deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot answer the query about data augmentation techniques applied in deep learning pipelines.
