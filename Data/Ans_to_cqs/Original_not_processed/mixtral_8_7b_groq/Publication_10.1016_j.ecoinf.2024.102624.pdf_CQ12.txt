Answer:::

The provided context does not mention the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the described classification pipeline. The classification was performed using traditional machine learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS). Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in this pipeline based on the given context.
