Answer:

The context provided does not give specific information about the deep learning frameworks used to build the model. However, it does mention the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which can be implemented in various deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras. It also mentions the use of a Bayesian optimizer, which is available in several deep learning libraries, including TensorFlow and PyTorch. Therefore, while the specific framework is not identified, it is likely that one of the popular deep learning frameworks that support CNN models and Bayesian optimization was used.
