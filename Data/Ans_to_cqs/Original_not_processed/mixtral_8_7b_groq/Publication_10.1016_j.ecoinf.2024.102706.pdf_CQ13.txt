The provided context does not mention any deep learning models or their hyperparameters. The models mentioned are linear regression, Enet, SVM, RF, XGboost, and LightGBM, which are machine learning models. Here are the hyperparameters for those models as mentioned in the context:

1. Enet: The hyperparameters for Elastic Net (Enet) are Î± and l1_ratio.

2. SVM: The hyperparameters for Support Vector Machine (SVM) are Cost (C), gamma, kernel, and epsilon.

3. RF: The hyperparameters for Random Forest (RF) are n_estimators, max_features, and max_depth.

4. XGboost: The hyperparameters for XGBoost are n_estimators, max_depth, learning_rate, num_leaves, feature_fraction, bagging_fraction, and bagging_freq.

5. LightGBM: The hyperparameters for LightGBM are n_estimators, max_depth, learning_rate, num_leaves, feature_fraction, and bagging_freq.
