Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, the authors of "Deep learning based drought assessment and prediction framework" (Kaur & Sood, 2020) compiled a comprehensive dataset with various influencing factors and a long drought propagation time series. They used a sliding window method to generate distinct datasets for model training, which could be seen as a form of diverse data collection.

In the study "A hybrid CNN-LSTM approach for monthly reservoir inflow forecasting" (Khorram & Jehbez, 2023), the authors introduced a hybrid CNN-LSTM model for drought prediction. Although not explicitly stated, the use of a hybrid model could be seen as a technique to address data bias by enhancing processing power and improving the model's ability to handle complexity in drought propagation time and relationships between influencing factors.

To summarize, while the context does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling, the authors have employed diverse data collection and the use of a hybrid model to address data bias indirectly.
