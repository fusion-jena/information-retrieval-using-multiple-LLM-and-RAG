Based on the provided context, there is no mention of specific postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix after the model training of the hybrid MCMC algorithm for the physiologically based model. The postprocessing steps described in the context are focused on the computation of the statistical distribution of the parameters.

Once the model training is completed, the final set of parameters is calculated by considering the second dataset from the genetic algorithm part of the process. The a posteriori distribution of the parameters is then generated by merging all the traces of each of the correct simulations into a single database. The statistical distribution of the parameters is reported by its mean and the standard deviation of the traces of the database of MCMC simulations.

Therefore, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training of this specific algorithm include the computation of the a posteriori distribution of the parameters and the reporting of the statistical distribution of the parameters by its mean and standard deviation.
