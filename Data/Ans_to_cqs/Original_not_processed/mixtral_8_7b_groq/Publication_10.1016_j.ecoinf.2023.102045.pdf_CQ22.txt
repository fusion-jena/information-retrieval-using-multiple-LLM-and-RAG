The provided context does not include information about the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. The texts mainly focus on topics related to ecology, informatics, mapping, color vision, and data visualization.

However, in the context of evaluating machine learning models, some common metrics to assess the performance of a deep learning model include:

1. Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions.
2. Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions (correctly labeled positive instances) among all positive predictions.
3. Recall (Sensitivity): The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.
4. F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced assessment of both measures.
5. Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC): A metric that measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.
6. Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Common metrics for regression tasks, measuring the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

These metrics are widely used in the machine learning community to evaluate the performance of deep learning models. However, without specific information from the provided context, it is not possible to determine which metrics were used in the evaluation of a deep learning model.
