Answer: In the context provided, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include resizing and normalization. Specifically, all images were resized to a standard resolution of 227x197 pixels, considering the mean dimensions of the dataset. After resizing, the images were normalized to the [0,1] range. This normalization step is crucial to ensure that all input features have similar scales, which can help the model converge faster and perform better.

It's important to note that no other preprocessing steps like scaling or cleaning were explicitly mentioned in the context. However, it's possible that the dataset was already cleaned and preprocessed before being used in the study.

In addition to these preprocessing steps, the study also used transfer learning to improve the performance of the models. This involved initializing each Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with weights from open source CNNs pre-trained on databases with similar characteristics to their dataset. For the classification task, they used CNNs pre-trained with the ImageNet database, while for the object detection task, they used CNNs pre-trained with the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) and iNaturalist databases.

Overall, the preprocessing steps involved in this study were resizing and normalization, followed by transfer learning to improve model performance.
