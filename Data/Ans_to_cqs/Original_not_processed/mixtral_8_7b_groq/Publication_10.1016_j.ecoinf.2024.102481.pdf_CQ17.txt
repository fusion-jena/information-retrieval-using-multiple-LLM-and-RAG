The provided context does not contain information about the regularization methods used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The text mainly discusses the use of Random Forests (RF), a machine learning method, for classifying reproductive conditions in fish. It also briefly mentions the growth of machine learning algorithms in various research areas, but it does not go into detail about the specific techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models.

Answer:::
The provided context does not include information on the regularization methods used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. The text focuses on using Random Forests (RF) for classifying reproductive conditions in fish and does not mention deep learning or its regularization techniques.
