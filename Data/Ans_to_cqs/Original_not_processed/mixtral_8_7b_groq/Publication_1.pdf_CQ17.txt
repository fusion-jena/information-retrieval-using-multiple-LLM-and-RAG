Answer:
Deep learning (DL) algorithms, like other machine learning models, are prone to overfitting, especially when trained on large datasets. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.

Two common regularization methods used in DL pipelines are L2 regularization and dropout.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the model's weights to the loss function. This penalty term discourages the model from assigning large weights to insignificant features, thereby reducing overfitting. L2 regularization is applied during the training process, and the model's weights are updated using stochastic gradient descent to minimize the regularized loss function.

Dropout is another regularization technique that involves randomly dropping out, or setting to zero, a fraction of the model's neurons during training. Dropout helps prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons, which is the tendency of neurons to become dependent on each other during training. By randomly dropping out neurons, dropout encourages the model to learn more robust features that are less prone to overfitting. Dropout is applied during the training process, and the model's weights are updated using stochastic gradient descent to minimize the loss function.

In summary, L2 regularization and dropout are two common regularization methods used in DL pipelines to prevent overfitting. L2 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the model's weights to the loss function, while dropout randomly drops out a fraction of the model's neurons during training. Both methods help prevent overfitting by encouraging the model to learn more robust features that are less prone to overfitting.
