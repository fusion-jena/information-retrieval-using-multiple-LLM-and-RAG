Answer:::
I regret to inform you that there is no information provided in the context about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The context includes details about various deep learning models, their architecture, and the training parameters used. However, it does not mention any code repository or version control platform (such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket) where the code for this deep learning pipeline is hosted. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
