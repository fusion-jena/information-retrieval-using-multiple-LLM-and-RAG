Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of the Adam optimization technique in the deep learning pipeline.

In the course of the experimentation, the most efficient solver for classification was found to be Adam, as Sgdm experienced drops in performance. This suggests that the researchers utilized the Adam optimizer for training their deep learning models.

The Adam optimizer is a popular choice in deep learning due to its ability to adaptively adjust the learning rate during training. It combines the advantages of two other optimization techniques, AdaGrad and RMSProp, by using the estimated first moment (mean) and second moment (uncentered variance) of the gradient. This allows Adam to effectively handle non-stationary objectives and sparse gradients, making it a suitable choice for a wide range of deep learning applications.

Although the context does not explicitly mention other optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), it is still possible that SGD or other optimization algorithms were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the provided information, it is clear that the Adam optimizer was preferred and performed better than Sgdm in this particular study.
