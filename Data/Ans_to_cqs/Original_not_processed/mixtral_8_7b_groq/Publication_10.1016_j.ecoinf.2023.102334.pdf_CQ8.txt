Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. There are several studies mentioned in the context that use deep learning methods for various applications such as wildlife surveillance, face recognition in sheep, and sika deer identification. However, none of the studies shared the code repository details in the given references. It is common for researchers to share their code to promote transparency and reproducibility of the results, but it is not guaranteed that all researchers will share their code publicly. Therefore, I would recommend contacting the authors of the relevant studies directly to inquire about the code repository.
