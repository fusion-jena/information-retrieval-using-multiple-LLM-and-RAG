Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline (3DUNetGSFormer) used for complex wetland mapping. The context includes details about the pipeline's development and its application for wetland classification, but it does not mention where the data repository is located.

It is possible that the data repository is not publicly available or has not been specified in the given text. In such cases, it is best to contact the authors directly for more information. In this case, the authors are A. Jamali, M. A. S. Khan, and M. A. B. Salman, and their affiliations are provided in the text.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query, and I recommend contacting the authors for more information about the data repository for the 3DUNetGSFormer deep learning pipeline.
