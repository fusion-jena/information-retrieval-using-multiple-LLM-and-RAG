Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a specific deep learning pipeline or a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context focuses on the process of curating and filtering a dataset of biodiversity occurrence records from GBIF and OBIS for a specific analysis. It describes the original number of records downloaded, the number of records remaining after data curation, taxonomic filtering, and deletion of data outside the native range. However, it does not mention any deep learning pipeline or data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
