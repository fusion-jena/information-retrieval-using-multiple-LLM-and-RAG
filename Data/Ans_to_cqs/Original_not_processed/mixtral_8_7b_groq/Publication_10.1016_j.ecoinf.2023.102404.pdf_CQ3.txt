The provided pieces of context do not include specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for remote sensing applications. However, I can provide some general information about common data annotation techniques used in deep learning.

In computer vision, data annotation is the process of labeling data, such as images or videos, to train machine learning models. For deep learning, data annotation techniques include:

1. Image classification: This is the most basic form of data annotation, where an image is labeled with a single class or category. For example, an image of a tree can be labeled as "tree."
2. Object detection: In this technique, a bounding box is drawn around an object in an image, and the object is labeled with its class or category. For example, a bounding box can be drawn around a car in an image, and the car can be labeled as "car."
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding class or category. For example, an image of a forest can be labeled with different classes such as "tree," "grass," and "soil."
4. Instance segmentation: This is a more advanced form of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is labeled separately. For example, in an image of a forest, each individual tree would be labeled as a separate instance.

In the context of remote sensing, data annotation techniques can be used to label features such as trees, buildings, roads, and water bodies in satellite or aerial imagery. These labeled images can then be used to train deep learning models for various applications such as land cover classification, object detection, and biomass estimation.

While the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques, it does mention the use of machine learning models for remote sensing applications such as biomass estimation. It is likely that data annotation techniques such as object detection or semantic segmentation were used to label the features in the remote sensing data before training the machine learning models. However, without specific information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
