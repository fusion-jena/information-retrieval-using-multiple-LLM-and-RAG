Answer:::
The deep learning model was built using the Keras framework with a TensorFlow backend. This information is derived from the eighth piece of context, which states that the model was coded in the programming language R with the Rstudio interface to Keras and TensorFlow backend. TensorFlow is a popular open-source platform for machine learning and deep learning, and Keras is a high-level neural networks API written in Python that runs on top of TensorFlow, Theano, and others. The use of Keras with TensorFlow backend allows for the efficient and flexible development of deep learning models.

Additionally, the model was trained and predicted using an Nvidia graphics card with 8 GB of dedicated memory, which is a common setup for deep learning tasks. The training of the models took 2-20 hours and prediction using GPU of a single tile of 16,384 Ã— 67.10 km2 took approximately 6 min. This indicates that the model is computationally intensive and the use of a powerful GPU and a deep learning framework like Keras with TensorFlow backend is necessary to handle the computations efficiently.

In summary, the Keras framework with TensorFlow backend is used to build the deep learning model. This setup allows for the efficient and flexible development of deep learning models, and it is well suited for computationally intensive tasks such as the one described in the context.
