The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models for bird species identification and the importance of monitoring bird diversity and acoustic activity. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

That being said, there are several techniques commonly used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, including:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain criteria (such as class labels) and then ensuring that each subgroup is represented proportionally in the training, validation, and test sets.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class in the dataset to balance it with the majority class.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class in the dataset to balance it with the minority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population being studied.

While the provided context does not mention these specific techniques, it does discuss the use of transfer learning and fine-tuning to overcome the issue of shortage of training data. This technique involves using a pre-trained model on a similar task and fine-tuning it on the target task. This can help to reduce data bias by leveraging the knowledge and features learned from the similar task.

Additionally, the context discusses the importance of collecting diverse data, as models already available in mobile apps for bird identification are rapidly advancing and able to identify a large number of bird species.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest the use of transfer learning and fine-tuning to overcome the issue of shortage of training data and the importance of collecting diverse data. Other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can also be used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.
