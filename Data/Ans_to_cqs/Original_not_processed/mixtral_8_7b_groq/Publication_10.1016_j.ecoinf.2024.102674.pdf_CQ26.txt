Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the issue of bias in the form of consistent negative average pbias values (underestimation) during the hot season and positive average pbias values (overestimation) during the cold season, particularly in the context of downscaling macroclimate grids.

The authors mention that downscaling techniques might encounter difficulties because they cannot catch climate-forcing effects not initially present in the coarse-scale products. They also highlight that the two descriptors used in the downscaling process, altitude and distance to the coast, were the only relevant ones.

In terms of data preprocessing for deep learning, the context discusses the use of cross-validation, which is a technique used to assess how the results of a statistical analysis will generalize to an independent data set. It is also used to tune model parameters and to validate the model.

The authors also mention the use of techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling in the context of Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines. These techniques are used to address class imbalance in the data, not explicitly bias, but it can be a form of bias. Stratified sampling is used to ensure that each fold is a good representative of the whole dataset, oversampling replicates instances from the minority class to balance the data, and undersampling reduces instances from the majority class.

Additionally, the authors mention the use of diverse data collection methods, such as interpolating weather station measurements with the help of altitude and distance to the coast as topographical predictors in the case of WorldClim's grid values.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it does discuss the use of cross-validation, stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling and diverse data collection methods. However, it is important to note that the context is focused on the downscaling of macroclimate grids and the use of machine learning algorithms for modeling, not specifically on data bias mitigation techniques during preprocessing of deep learning pipelines.
