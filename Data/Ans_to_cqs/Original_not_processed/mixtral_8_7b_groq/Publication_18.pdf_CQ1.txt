Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline typically involves collecting raw data through various methods, including surveys, sensors, and public datasets. 

In the context of analyzing whale images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the raw data collection is carried out using aerial images, as described in the study titled "Deep learning for automatic detection of whales in high-resolution satellite imagery" (Bryde's whales dataset) [53]. Here, the authors used high-resolution satellite imagery to collect the dataset for training the CNN.

Similarly, in the context of skin cancer classification using deep neural networks, the raw data would consist of images of various skin lesions. The study "Dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer with deep neural networks" [54] mentions that the dataset used for training the CNN includes dermatoscopic images of common skin cancers, such as melanoma, melanocytic nevi, and seborrheic keratosis.

In the context of mastering the game of Go using deep neural networks and tree search, the raw data would be the records of Go games. The study "Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search" [55] mentions that the AlphaGo program used a dataset of around 30 million moves from games played by human experts to train its neural networks.

For the case of image pre-processing for convolutional neural networks, the raw data would be the original images. The study "A snapshot of image pre-processing for convolutional neural networks: case rocks" [59] mentions that the dataset used for training the CNN includes images of rocks, which are pre-processed before being fed into the CNN.

In addition to these specific examples, raw data for deep learning can also be collected through public datasets, sensors, and surveys. For instance, the study "Free satellite data key to conservation" [76] mentions that free satellite data is now available, which can be used for conservation efforts, such as monitoring biodiversity and habitats. Similarly, the study "Technology and satellite companies open up a world of data" [77] highlights that satellite companies are making vast amounts of data publicly available, which can be used for various applications, including deep learning.

Furthermore, the study "How do we want Satellite Remote Sensing to support biodiversity conservation globally?" [78] discusses the potential of satellite remote sensing for biodiversity conservation, which involves collecting raw data through sensors.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline involves collecting raw data through various methods, including surveys, sensors, and public datasets. The examples provided in the context of whale detection, skin cancer classification, Go game records, and image pre-processing illustrate the use of specific datasets for training CNNs. Additionally, the availability of free satellite data and satellite remote sensing highlights the potential of sensors for collecting raw data for deep learning applications.
