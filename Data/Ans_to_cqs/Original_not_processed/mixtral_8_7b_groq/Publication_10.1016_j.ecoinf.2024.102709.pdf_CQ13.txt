Answer:::
The provided context discusses the use of k-fold cross-validation, epochs, and image size in the training process of the deep learning model. However, it does not explicitly mention the learning rate or the optimizer used in the model.

The k-fold cross-validation technique involves splitting the data into k different training-test sets and training the model on each split. This method helps in determining the best data split for the model. The number of repetitions for training is determined by the epochs, and the image size is expressed in pixels.

The context also mentions that the functions of the Python library scikit-learn were used to split the data and investigate the results of each trained model. However, the specific functions used are not specified.

In addition, the YOLO loss function is divided into three parts, including box loss, which is a regression loss that measures the error in the predicted bounding box coordinates and dimensions relative to the ground truth. The box loss is computed using Intersection over Union (IoU) and distributional focal loss (DFL).

The models were trained using either the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits or the clusters of extracted numbers. However, the context does not provide information on the learning rate or the optimizer used in the model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer.
