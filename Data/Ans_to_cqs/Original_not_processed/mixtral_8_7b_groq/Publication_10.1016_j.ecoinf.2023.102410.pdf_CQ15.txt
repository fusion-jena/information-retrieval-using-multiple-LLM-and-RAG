Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on data analysis and song variant tracking of humpback whales, without mentioning any details about the machine learning models or optimization techniques employed.

However, it is important to note that the CRediT authorship contribution statement mentions Robert D. McCauley and Alexander N. Gavrilov as contributing to the methodology and formal analysis. These authors might have used standard optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or others. But without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.

Answer:::
The provided context does not include information on the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
