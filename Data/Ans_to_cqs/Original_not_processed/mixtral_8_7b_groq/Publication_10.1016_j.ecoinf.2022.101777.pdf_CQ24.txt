The text provided describes the use of a machine learning technique called Random Forest (RF) for image classification, but it does not directly mention the term "deep learning" or discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. However, RF does employ randomness as a part of its algorithm, primarily through the use of a random seed value and the iterative creation of decision trees.

In RF, a random seed value is used to initialize the random number generator, which in turn is used to select a random subset of the training data for each decision tree. This process is known as bootstrap aggregating or bagging. By using a different subset of the training data for each tree, RF reduces overfitting and increases the robustness of the model.

Additionally, RF uses a random subset of the input features to split each node in the decision trees. This is known as random feature selection. By considering only a random subset of the features, RF further reduces overfitting and improves the generalization of the model.

The number of trees and the number of training samples are also important parameters that can affect the randomness of the RF algorithm. Increasing the number of trees can reduce the variance of the model, but it also increases the computation time. Similarly, increasing the number of training samples can improve the accuracy of the model, but it also increases the risk of overfitting.

In summary, RF employs several strategies to handle randomness in its algorithm, including the use of a random seed value, bootstrap aggregating, random feature selection, and the number of trees and training samples. While the text provided does not directly mention deep learning, these strategies could also be applied to deep learning pipelines to improve the robustness and generalization of the models.
