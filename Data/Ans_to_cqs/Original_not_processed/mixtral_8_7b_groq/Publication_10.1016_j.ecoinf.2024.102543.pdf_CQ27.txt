The text provided does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does provide information about some steps that might be involved in the deployment process.

First, after training the model, it is common to serialize it, which means converting the model into a format that can be stored and loaded efficiently. Model serialization can be done using various formats such as JSON, XML, or using specific libraries such as TensorFlow's SavedModel or PyTorch's TorchScript. Serialization allows the model to be easily deployed to different platforms or shared with other researchers.

Next, the selection of a platform for deployment is an important step. The platform could be a local machine, a cloud server, or an edge device, depending on the requirements of the application. The platform selection may depend on factors such as the computational resources available, the latency requirements, and the cost of deployment.

After selecting the platform, the serialized model can be loaded and deployed on the platform. The deployment process may involve integrating the model into a larger application or creating a separate service for the model. The application or service would then take input from users or other systems, pass it through the model to generate predictions, and return the results to the user or system.

It is also important to consider the performance of the model during deployment. The text provided mentions that the model's performance was evaluated using various metrics such as precision, recall, mAP, params, flops, inference time, and time. These metrics can help ensure that the model is performing well and meeting the requirements of the application.

Finally, it is worth noting that the text provided mentions that the model was trained using a dataset that was preprocessed and augmented to improve its diversity and robustness. These preprocessing and augmentation steps may also be important to consider during deployment, as they can affect the model's performance and accuracy.

In summary, while the text provided does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it does provide information about some steps that might be involved in the deployment process, such as model serialization, platform selection, integration into an application or service, performance evaluation, and preprocessing and augmentation of the dataset.
