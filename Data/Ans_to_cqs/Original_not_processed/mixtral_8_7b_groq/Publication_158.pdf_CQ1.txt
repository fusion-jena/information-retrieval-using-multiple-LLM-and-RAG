Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context mainly focuses on the description of the deep-learning classifier used for image analysis, particularly for change detection, and the details of the CNN architecture, training strategy, and evaluation metrics.

However, it can be inferred that the input images used in the study are related to change detection and possibly contain objects of varying sizes and scales. The images are processed using a CNN architecture with varying input image sizes, and the training is performed using the Adam optimizer, categorical-cross entropy loss function, and data augmentation techniques such as rotation, reflection bias, and random noise.

Therefore, it is likely that the raw data used in this study are collected through sensors or imaging devices that capture images of the objects or scenes of interest. Public datasets or surveys may also be used as sources of raw data, but this information is not explicitly provided in the context.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data, it can be inferred that the input images are obtained through sensors or imaging devices and possibly supplemented with data augmentation techniques for training the deep-learning classifier.
