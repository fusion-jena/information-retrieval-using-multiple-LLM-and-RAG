Based on the provided context, there is no specific information given about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses a study related to ecological informatics and species habitat use, which uses long-term historical data, anthropogenic variables, and machine learning techniques for projection and analysis. However, it does not mention any particular datasets used in the deep learning strategies.

In general, when it comes to deep learning in the context of image recognition, some commonly used datasets include MNIST (handwritten digit recognition), CIFAR (object recognition), and ImageNet (object recognition with millions of images). These datasets are widely used as benchmarks for evaluating the performance of deep learning models. However, without specific information from the study, it is not possible to determine if these or any other particular datasets were used.
