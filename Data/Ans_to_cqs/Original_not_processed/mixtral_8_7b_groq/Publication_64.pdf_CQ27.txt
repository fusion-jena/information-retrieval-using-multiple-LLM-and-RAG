The text provided gives some information about the training of the deep learning model, but it does not explicitly describe the process of deploying the trained model. However, it does provide some context that can be used to make an educated guess.

The deep learning framework used for this project is Lasagne, which is built on top of Theano. Theano is a popular library for numerical computations in Python, which allows for efficient symbolic differentiation and fast computation on GPUs. Once the model is trained, it can be saved as a serialized file using the pickle module in Python. This allows the model to be loaded and used in a different Python script or environment.

The platform selection would depend on the specific use case and the resources available. Since the model was trained on a GTX 1080 GPU, it would be most efficient to use a similar GPU for making predictions. However, if a GPU is not available, the model can still be used on a CPU, although the predictions may take longer to compute.

To use the model for making predictions, the input images would need to be preprocessed in the same way as they were during training. This includes applying data augmentation, such as shearing, translation, and mirroring, and downscaling the image to the ResNet standard size of 224x224 pixels. Once the input image is preprocessed, it can be passed through the model to obtain the predicted class probabilities.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the process of deploying the trained deep learning model would likely involve serializing the model using pickle, selecting an appropriate platform for making predictions, preprocessing the input images, and passing the preprocessed images through the model to obtain the predicted class probabilities.
