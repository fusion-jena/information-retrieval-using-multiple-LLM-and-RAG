Answer:::

Based on the information provided, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository for it in the study. The researchers considered using deep learning algorithms for estimating water quality parameters (WQP) in Nansi Lake, but they decided not to proceed due to the limited number of samples. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline. However, the study does mention other data sources such as the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and Landsat satellites, which were used for WQP estimation. Additionally, the study also refers to various machine learning models and techniques used for WQP estimation, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), and XGBoost. However, there is no information provided about a deep learning pipeline or its data repository.
