Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The text mainly focuses on the data collection, results, and conclusions of a study related to soil degradation.

However, it does mention some details about the data collection process and the methods used for analyzing the data. For instance, the study used the Geographical Detector to analyze the data, which requires a large size of geographic samples. It also suggests that in future research, data from multiple sources should be processed jointly to improve temporal and spatial accuracy.

Furthermore, the study calculated various statistical measures such as the sum of squares of different levels in the study region (SSW and SST), the sum variance over the region (σ2), and the sum of the sample's variance in sub-region h (σh). These measures could potentially be used to monitor the model performance during training.

Therefore, while there is no explicit information provided about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, it can be inferred that the study may have used statistical measures and cross-validation techniques to ensure the validity and reliability of their model. However, further information would be required to provide a more definitive answer.
