The provided context does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset is being used for pretraining a model for rice disease identification. This dataset is augmented to increase the number of images and classes.

In general, there are several data annotation techniques commonly used in deep learning for computer vision tasks, such as:

1. Image-level annotation: This is the simplest form of annotation where each image is labeled with a single class. It is useful for image classification tasks.

2. Bounding box annotation: In this method, a bounding box is drawn around the object of interest in an image. It is used for object detection tasks where the goal is to locate the object within the image.

3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with a corresponding class. It is used for image segmentation tasks where the goal is to separate the object from the background and other objects in the image.

4. Instance segmentation: This is a more advanced form of segmentation where each instance of an object is segmented and labeled separately. It is used for tasks where multiple objects of the same class need to be identified and distinguished from each other.

5. Landmark annotation: In this method, key points or landmarks are identified and labeled in an image. It is used for tasks such as facial recognition or pose estimation.

Based on the context provided, it can be inferred that the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset is likely annotated using one or more of these techniques, possibly including image-level annotation for rice disease classification and bounding box or instance segmentation for identifying and locating the disease in the image. However, without explicit information from the context, a definitive answer cannot be given.
