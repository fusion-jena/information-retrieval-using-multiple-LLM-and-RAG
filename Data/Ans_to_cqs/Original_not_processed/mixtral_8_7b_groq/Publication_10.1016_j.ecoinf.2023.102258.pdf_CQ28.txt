Based on the information provided, there is no mention of any specific cloud platform (such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform) that was used to deploy the deep learning models. The text focuses on describing the methods and techniques used for the few-shot learning task of bird species identification, rather than providing details about the implementation or deployment of the models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
