Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the strategies implemented to monitor model performance during training. The text mentions various modeling approaches and validation methods used in different studies, but it does not specify how the model performance was monitored during the training process.

In the first piece of context, it is mentioned that the studies used either internal validation strategies or external validation methods to measure model performance. However, this information pertains to the validation of the final model rather than the monitoring of model performance during training.

The second piece of context provides a list of modeling techniques used in the reviewed literature, but it does not mention any strategies for monitoring model performance during training.

The third piece of context gives information on the types of model results, such as species spatial predictions and projections, but it does not provide any details about the monitoring of model performance during training.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query regarding the strategy implemented to monitor model performance during training.
