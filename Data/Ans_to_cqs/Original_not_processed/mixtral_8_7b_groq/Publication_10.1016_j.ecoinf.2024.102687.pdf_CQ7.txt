Answer:

The text does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it does mention that the training data was acquired by sending query parameters through the API of Xeno-Cano, which returned a JSON object containing recording metadata. The recordings were then downloaded based on specific query parameters, including audio quality, duration, maximum number of recordings allowed per species, and geographic coordinates surrounding the Equator line in America.

In the context of deep learning, it is common practice to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

The criteria used to split the data can vary depending on the specific use case and the amount of available data. One common approach is to use a 60-20-20 split, where 60% of the data is used for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing. Another approach is k-fold cross-validation, where the data is split into k folds, and the model is trained and validated k times, each time with a different fold used as the validation set.

In the context of the Xeno-Cano recordings, one possible approach could be to split the data based on geographic coordinates, using recordings from one region for training, recordings from a different region for validation, and recordings from a third region for testing. Alternatively, the data could be split based on species, using recordings from some species for training, recordings from other species for validation, and recordings from yet other species for testing.

Overall, while the text does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it is clear that the data was acquired using specific query parameters, and that a split into training, validation, and testing sets is a common practice in deep learning.
