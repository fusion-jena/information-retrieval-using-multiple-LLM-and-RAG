Answer:::

The text does not provide explicit information on how the hyperparameters of the model, such as those related to TensorFlow, are optimized. Hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in deep learning model development, and techniques like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization are commonly used. However, the specific method used in this case is not mentioned in the text.

The text does provide some insight into how the number of training steps was determined for the Mexican and Brazilian species datasets. They considered the correct identification rate and processing time to find an optimum number of training steps. For the Mexican dataset, 2,000 emerged as the optimum number of training steps, which resulted in an 83.0% overall identification rate. However, this does not necessarily mean they used a grid search or random search over different numbers of training steps. They might have determined this number based on their understanding of the data and the model's performance.

In conclusion, while the text provides some information about the optimization process related to the number of training steps, it does not provide explicit information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized.
