Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of measures such as a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications of specific decisions made during the analysis that could potentially contribute to the model's generalizability.

Firstly, the selection of a larger FFT window size could potentially improve the model's performance at lower frequencies where cows vocalize. This decision was made to enhance the resolution in the frequency range of interest, which could help the model capture a wider range of cow vocalizations.

Secondly, the use of cow-specific parameters in the model could also contribute to its generalizability. By fitting parameters tailored to the unique characteristics of cow vocalizations, the model may be better equipped to detect and classify these sounds accurately, even in the presence of variability or noise.

Lastly, the evaluation of the model's precision using the number of cow calls detected by the software divided by the total number of ROIs within the "Cow" cluster can be seen as an indirect measure of generalizability. This metric provides an estimate of the percentage of ROIs correctly labeled by the model, which could give some insight into the model's ability to perform well on new, unseen data.

However, it is important to note that these measures do not explicitly address common techniques for improving model generalizability, such as collecting a diverse dataset, employing cross-validation, or using stratified splitting. Therefore, it is possible that these techniques were not used in this study, or that they were not mentioned in the provided context.
