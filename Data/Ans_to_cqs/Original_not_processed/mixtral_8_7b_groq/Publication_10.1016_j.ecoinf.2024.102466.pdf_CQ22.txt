Answer: The metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in the provided context is mean Average Precision (mAP). The mAP is a common evaluation metric in object detection tasks and is based on the precision-recall curve. It calculates the average precision value for recall values ranging from 0 to 1. In the context, the mAP is used to compare the performance of different object detection models for bird recognition in camera trap images. The models are evaluated based on their mAP scores at different training stages and with varying pixel sizes of the bird instance. Other metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
