Based on the provided context, there is no specific deep learning model mentioned in the pipeline for water quality management. Instead, the paper by Wai et al., 2022 discusses various applications of deep learning techniques in water quality management without specifying a particular model.

However, it is worth noting that deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers have been widely used in environmental and hydrological studies for different purposes. For instance, CNNs are commonly used for image analysis and can be applied to analyze satellite images for water quality monitoring. RNNs are suitable for time-series data analysis and can be used to predict water quality parameters based on historical data. Transformers, on the other hand, are useful for sequence-to-sequence tasks and can be applied to predict water quality parameters based on textual data.

Therefore, while the specific deep learning model is not mentioned in the provided context, it is likely that one of the aforementioned models or a combination of them could be used in the pipeline for water quality management. The choice of the deep learning model would depend on the specific requirements of the problem and the nature of the available data.
