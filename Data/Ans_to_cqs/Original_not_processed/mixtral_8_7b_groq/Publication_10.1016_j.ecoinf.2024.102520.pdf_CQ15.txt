The provided context does not contain information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on a study of total soil nitrogen (TSN) and total soil phosphorus (TSP) under various physiographic positions and their correlation with other soil and site parameters.

However, I can provide a general answer to the query.

Answer:::
In deep learning, optimization techniques are used to minimize the loss function and update the model's parameters during training. Some commonly used optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Momentum, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG), Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model's parameters by computing the gradient of the loss function for a single training example or a mini-batch of examples.

Adam is a popular optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of Adagrad and Momentum. It estimates the first and second moments of the gradient and uses them to adapt the learning rate for each parameter.

The choice of optimization technique depends on the specific problem, the size and complexity of the dataset, and the computational resources available. In practice, it is common to experiment with different optimization algorithms and hyperparameters to find the best combination for a given problem.
