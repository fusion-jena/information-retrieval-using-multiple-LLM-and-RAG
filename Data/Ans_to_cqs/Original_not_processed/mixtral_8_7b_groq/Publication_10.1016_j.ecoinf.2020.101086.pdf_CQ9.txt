Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study "Correcting the effect of sampling bias in species distribution modeling â€“ A new method in the case of a low number of presence data" by Moua et al. (2020). The article does not mention or provide a link to any data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.

It is important to note that data repositories are essential for reproducibility and transparency in scientific research. Therefore, it is recommended to contact the authors or the journal to inquire about the availability of the data.

Another possible approach is to search for the data in the aforementioned data repositories using keywords such as the name of the study, the name of the first author, or the title of the journal. However, this method may not always yield results, especially if the data has not been deposited in a repository.

In summary, the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Moua et al. (2020) is not specified in the provided context. It is recommended to contact the authors or the journal for more information.
