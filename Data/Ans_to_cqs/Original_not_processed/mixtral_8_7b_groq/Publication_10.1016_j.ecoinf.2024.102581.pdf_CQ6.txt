Answer:

In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the training process of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) involves optimizing the network parameters using large-scale labeled training data through techniques such as backpropagation and gradient descent. This implies that the training data used in the study is already preprocessed and labeled.

In general, preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include data cleaning, normalization, scaling, and augmentation. Data cleaning involves removing or correcting erroneous data points that can negatively impact the model's performance. Normalization and scaling are used to adjust the range of the data features so that the model can learn effectively. Data normalization is the process of rescaling numeric data values to a common range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling, on the other hand, involves resizing the features of the data to have equal importance in the model. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to the existing data.

In the context of the study, it is mentioned that the proposed approach involves sampling the feature maps to reduce dimensionality. Feature maps are the output of each convolutional layer in a CNN, and they represent the spatial features of the input data. Sampling the feature maps reduces the dimensionality of the data, which can help improve the model's performance and reduce the computational complexity.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved, it is implied that the data is preprocessed before training the CNN. The preprocessing steps may include data cleaning, normalization, scaling, and augmentation, as well as sampling the feature maps to reduce dimensionality.
