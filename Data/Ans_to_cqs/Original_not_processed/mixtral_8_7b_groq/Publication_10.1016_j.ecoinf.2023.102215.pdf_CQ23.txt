The context provided does not give specific details about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model is trained using a binary cross-entropy loss function, which is a commonly employed loss function in supervised deep learning. This information suggests that the model is trained in a supervised manner, but it does not provide information about the data used for training or any steps taken to prevent overfitting or ensure generalizability.

In order to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, it is important to use a diverse and representative dataset for training. This can be achieved through techniques such as data augmentation, which involves creating new training examples by applying transformations to the existing data. Cross-validation is another technique that can be used to ensure the generalizability of a model. This involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, or folds, and training the model on different subsets of the data. The model's performance is then evaluated on the remaining subsets, providing an estimate of how well the model is likely to perform on new, unseen data.

Stratified splitting is another technique that can be used to ensure the generalizability of a model, particularly in the case of imbalanced datasets. This involves dividing the dataset into subsets in a way that preserves the distribution of classes or labels in the data. This can help to ensure that the model is exposed to a representative sample of each class during training, and is not biased towards the majority class.

Without more information about the specific techniques used in this study, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query. However, it is likely that some combination of these techniques was used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
