Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the sources, we can infer that they might have used a combination of statistical measures and visualization techniques to assess the performance of their models.

For instance, Whoriskey et al. (2017) used a Hidden Markov Model for identifying behavioral states from animal tracks. They mentioned that they used the Viterbi algorithm to estimate the most likely sequence of hidden states given the observed data. They also calculated the posterior probabilities of the hidden states to evaluate the model's performance.

Wiggins et al. (2004) and Wiggins et al. (2013) used concurrent visual and acoustic tracking of fin whales and tracking dolphin whistles, respectively. Although they did not mention the specific strategy for monitoring the model performance during training, they might have used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of their models.

Moreover, they might have used visualization techniques such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves to further assess the model's performance. These techniques can provide a better understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses and help identify any potential issues during training.

In addition, they might have implemented strategies such as early stopping, learning rate scheduling, and regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance. These strategies can help monitor the model's performance during training and prevent it from memorizing the training data.

Therefore, while the specific strategy for monitoring the model performance during training is not provided in the context, we can infer that they might have used a combination of statistical measures, visualization techniques, and training strategies to ensure the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
