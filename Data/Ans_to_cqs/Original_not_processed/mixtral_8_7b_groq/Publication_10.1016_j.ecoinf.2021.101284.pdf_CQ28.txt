The provided context does not contain information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. There is a mention of a deep learning algorithm used for early diagnosis of COVID-19 in a study by Castillo (2020), but there is no information about the platform used for deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
