Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific details about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the deep learning platform used is TensorFlow 2.6. TensorFlow supports various optimizers and learning rate schedules, so it is possible that the authors used one of the built-in optimizers such as Adam, SGD, or RMSProp, and possibly employed learning rate decay or other techniques to improve model training. Without further information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
