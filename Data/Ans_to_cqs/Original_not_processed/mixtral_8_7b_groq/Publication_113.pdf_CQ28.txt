Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the specific platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the development and implementation of an active learning system for species identification and counting in camera trap images using a deep learning approach. It explains the algorithm used for active learning, the different strategies employed to select samples for labelling, and the results obtained. However, it does not mention any details about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
