Answer: The provided context discusses two data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for image-based species classification, namely bounding box annotation and attention-guided data augmentation.

Bounding box annotation is a method used to mark the location of objects within an image. It involves drawing a rectangle, called a bounding box, around the object to distinguish it from the background and other objects in the image. This technique is commonly used in fine-grained image classification (FGIC) for categorizing objects at a detailed level. For instance, Wei et al. (2018) and Wang et al. (2023) followed FGIC methods and used bounding boxes to annotate birds in their studies.

Attention-guided data augmentation is another data annotation technique that involves using attention mechanisms to guide the data augmentation process. This method focuses on augmenting the most relevant and informative parts of the input data, thus improving the model's learning and performance. Wang et al. (2023) used attention-guided data augmentation in their study to categorize birds at a detailed level, achieving 85-87% accuracy.

Moreover, the context also mentions the use of Mask Convolutional Neural Network (M-CNN) in FGIC studies (Wei et al., 2018). M-CNN is a deep learning architecture that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with mask regions to perform object detection and semantic segmentation. In the context of FGIC, M-CNN can be used for bounding box annotation and instance segmentation, where instance segmentation involves dividing an image into multiple segments, each representing a distinct object.

In summary, the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for image-based species classification include bounding box annotation, attention-guided data augmentation, and instance segmentation using Mask Convolutional Neural Network (M-CNN). These techniques help improve the model's learning and performance by accurately marking the location and features of objects within an image.
