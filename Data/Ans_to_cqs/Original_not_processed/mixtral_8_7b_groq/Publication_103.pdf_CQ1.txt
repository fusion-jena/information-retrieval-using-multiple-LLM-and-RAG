Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of certain datasets in the experiments.

The first dataset used is ImageNet, a generalist dataset used for pre-training the neural network to initialize the weights. ImageNet is a large-scale image recognition dataset that is widely used in the computer vision community. It contains over 14 million images belonging to 1000 classes.

The second dataset mentioned is Herbarium255, which contains 255 species of herbarium specimens from Costa Rica. The dataset is divided into 70% training data and 30% test data for computing the top-1 and top-5 classification accuracy.

The third dataset mentioned is Herbarium1K, which contains 1000 species of herbarium specimens from France. The dataset is divided into 80% training data and 20% test data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of public datasets for pre-training the network and then fine-tuning it on domain-specific data. This suggests that the authors may have used other publicly available datasets for pre-training the network.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data, it does provide information about the use of pre-existing datasets in the deep learning pipeline.
