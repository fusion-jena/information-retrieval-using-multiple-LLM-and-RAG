Answer:::
The deep learning model was trained and tested on Microsoft Azure, according to the provided context. More specifically, the Data Science Virtual Machine and a NCv2-series virtual machine (NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPU) were used for model training and testing. However, it is important to note that the ResNet152V2 model was also deliberately trained on a virtual machine running the "E2asV4" instance on Microsoft Azure with 16GB RAM and a 2.35Ghz AMD EPYCâ„¢ 7452 2 vCPU to verify that training could be executed on less expensive hardware.
