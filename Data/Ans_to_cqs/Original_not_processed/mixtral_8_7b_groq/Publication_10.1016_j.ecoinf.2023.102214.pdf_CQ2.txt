Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in this particular study utilizes image data. The researchers have developed a novel deep learning method for snow leopard image classification, using a large fully labeled snow leopard dataset compiled for this purpose. This dataset, along with any future datasets contributed to Whiskerbook.org, will be used to continuously curate and enhance the data used in the deep learning pipeline.

The study by Johansson et al. (2020) mentioned in the context also worked with image data, specifically camera trap images, for snow leopard population estimation. Other studies incorporated into the context, such as Bhatta-Hartog (2013), He et al. (2019), and Bogucki et al. (2019), have similarly focused on image data for individual identification of various species.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline discussed in the context primarily uses image data, specifically for the purpose of image classification and individual identification in ecological and environmental applications. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in this particular pipeline.
