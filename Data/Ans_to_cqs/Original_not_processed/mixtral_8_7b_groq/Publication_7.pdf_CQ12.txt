Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline described in the given context is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is specified in the text when it mentions that "deep CNNs" are used and that they are composed of multiple layers of processing involving linear as well as non-linear operators. Additionally, the use of spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) and Multi-scale Orderless Pooling (MOP) schemes, which are commonly used with CNNs, further supports this. CNNs are a popular choice for computer vision tasks due to their ability to effectively process and learn from grid-like data such as images.
