The provided context discusses methods to minimize biased training of machine learning models, specifically in the context of bootstrap aggregation applications like Random Forest. However, it does not directly address data bias techniques during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I will provide a general answer based on common practices in the field of machine learning.

Answer:::
In deep learning pipelines, several techniques are employed during the preprocessing stage to address data bias and improve model performance. Some of these techniques include:

1. **Stratified sampling**: This method ensures that the train and test datasets have approximately the same percentage of samples for each class in imbalanced datasets, reducing bias during model training.

2. **Oversampling**: In cases of underrepresented classes, oversampling can be used to balance the dataset by replicating samples from the minority class. However, this may lead to overfitting, so techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) are often preferred.

3. **Undersampling**: Alternatively, undersampling can be used to balance the dataset by reducing the number of samples from the majority class. This method, however, may result in loss of valuable information.

4. **Diverse data collection**: Collecting data from various sources, perspectives, and distributions can help reduce bias and improve model generalization. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with real-world data that may have inherent biases.

5. **Data augmentation**: This technique generates new synthetic samples by applying transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping) to the existing dataset. Data augmentation helps increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, reducing overfitting and bias.

Please note that the context provided focuses on addressing biases in model training and validation, specifically for geospatial models, using bootstrap aggregation and spatial autocorrelation information.
