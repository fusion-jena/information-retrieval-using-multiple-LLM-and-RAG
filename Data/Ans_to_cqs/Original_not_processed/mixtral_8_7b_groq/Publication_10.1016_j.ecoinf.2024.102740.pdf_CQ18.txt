The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of an "out-of-bag" (OOB) sample estimate. This method is specifically used in Random Forest (RF) models for internal validation. The OOB samples are those not included in the training subset, and the RF generates an impartial estimate of the generalization error using these samples. In the study mentioned, the total number of samples used for validation through the OOB method is 8. This strategy allows for the monitoring of the model's performance during the training phase, providing an estimate of how well the model will perform on unseen data.
