Based on the provided context, the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs, are not mentioned. The text focuses on the methodology used to determine the optimal structure of an artificial neural network (ANN) for a specific application in ecological informatics. It explains the trial-and-error approach used to select the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the learning rate, as well as the early stopping technique to prevent overfitting. The final ANN structure had five input variables, 19 hidden neurons, a 0.7 learning rate, and one output variable. However, it does not mention the use of specialized hardware for training the model. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.
