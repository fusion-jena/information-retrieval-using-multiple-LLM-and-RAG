The provided context discusses various machine learning algorithms and their applications in ecological studies, including random forests and support vector machines. However, it does not directly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value.

Deep learning pipelines often involve randomness in various stages, such as weight initialization, dropout, data shuffling, and batch sampling. While the context does not explicitly mention deep learning, it does discuss random forests, which is a type of machine learning algorithm that can handle randomness.

Random forests use bagging (bootstrap aggregating) to reduce overfitting and improve the model's performance. Bagging involves creating multiple subsets of the original data by randomly sampling with replacement. Each subset is used to train a decision tree, and the final prediction is obtained by aggregating the predictions from all decision trees. This process introduces randomness, as each subset is different, and the trees are not correlated.

However, the context does not mention any specific strategy for handling randomness, such as the use of a random seed value. A random seed value is a starting point for the random number generator, ensuring that the same sequence of random numbers is produced each time the code is run. This can be useful for reproducibility and debugging purposes.

In summary, while the provided context discusses machine learning algorithms and their applications in ecological studies, it does not directly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. Random forests, which are mentioned in the context, use bagging to handle randomness, but the context does not provide information on other strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.
