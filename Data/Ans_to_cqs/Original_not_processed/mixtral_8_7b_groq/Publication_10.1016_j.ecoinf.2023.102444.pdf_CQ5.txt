Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for species distribution modeling are not explicitly mentioned. The text discusses the use of UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for reducing the dimensionality of bioclimatic variables, which were extracted from raster layers at a global level. These bioclimatic variables are commonly used in Species Distribution Models (SDM) and represent ecological conditions for the environment and species locations, derived from temperature and precipitation data.

However, the context does not mention any of the standard deep learning image datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it appears that the authors have used their own dataset of bioclimatic variables for this study.
