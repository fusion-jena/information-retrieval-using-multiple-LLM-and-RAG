Answer:

The provided pieces of context do not include information about a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The sources mention various studies and methods related to using deep learning for land cover classification, remote sensing, and ecological informatics. However, they do not provide a direct link to a code repository.

For resources that use the U-Net model, such as Kattenborn et al. (2021), it is likely that the code repositories are hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. However, without specific information, it is not possible to directly provide a code repository link.

If you are interested in the U-Net model or other deep learning methods for land cover classification and remote sensing, you may want to search for repositories on the aforementioned platforms using relevant keywords, such as "U-Net deep learning," "remote sensing," "land cover classification," or "ecological informatics." This approach can help you find relevant code repositories and resources for your specific needs.
