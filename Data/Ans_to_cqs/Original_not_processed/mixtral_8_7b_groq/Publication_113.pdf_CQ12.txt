Answer:::
The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). This is inferred from the context that mentions the use of a pre-trained detector model, which are often CNNs, and the application of the pipeline to image data. Additionally, the pipeline involves resizing cropped images to a fixed size and processing them, which is a common preprocessing step for image data before feeding it into a CNN. Furthermore, the paper mentions fine-tuning the embedding model, which is a common practice in transfer learning with CNNs. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a deep CNN.
