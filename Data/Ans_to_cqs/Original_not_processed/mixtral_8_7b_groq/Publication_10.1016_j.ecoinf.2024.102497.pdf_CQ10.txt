Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various topics related to remote sensing data analysis, such as the use of Gaofen-6 (GF-6) imagery, radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, geometric correction, and image cropping. It also mentions the application of CART (Classification and Regression Tree) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) models for regression tasks. However, there is no information about the code repository or the deep learning pipeline.

The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in the paper. This declaration is not related to the code repository link.

Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link based on the given context. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
