Answer:::
The deep learning models mentioned in the context are used for image classification tasks. Specifically, they are used to classify images of plants into one of 38 different classes. This is evident in the description of the softMax layer, which produces a distribution of values across the 38 classes that add up to 1, representing the confidences of the network that a given input image is represented by the corresponding classes.

The two deep learning architectures used for this classification task are AlexNet and GoogLeNet. These architectures have been trained using different training mechanisms, including Transfer Learning and Training from Scratch. Transfer Learning involves using a pre-trained model as a starting point and fine-tuning it on a new dataset, while Training from Scratch involves training a model from randomly initialized weights.

The models have been trained on three different types of datasets: Color, Gray scale, and Leaf Segmented. The choice of dataset type may affect the performance of the model, as different types of data may require different features to be extracted and analyzed.

Finally, the models have been trained using various training-testing set distributions, such as Train: 80%, Test: 20%, Train: 60%, Test: 40%, Train: 50%, Test: 50%, Train: 40%, Test: 60%, and Train: 20%, Test: 80%. The choice of training-testing set distribution may also affect the performance of the model, as it determines the amount of data used for training and testing the model.

In summary, the deep learning models mentioned in the context are used for image classification tasks, specifically for classifying images of plants into one of 38 different classes. The models have been trained using different training mechanisms, dataset types, and training-testing set distributions, which may affect the performance of the model.
