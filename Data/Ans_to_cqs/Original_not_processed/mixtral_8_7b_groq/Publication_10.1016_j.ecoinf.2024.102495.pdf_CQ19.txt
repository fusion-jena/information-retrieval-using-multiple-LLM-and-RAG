Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the deep learning framework used to build the model. However, it is mentioned that Python was used, which has several efficient deep learning libraries. Commonly used libraries include TensorFlow and PyTorch. Therefore, based on the context, it can be inferred that either TensorFlow or PyTorch was used to build the deep learning model.
