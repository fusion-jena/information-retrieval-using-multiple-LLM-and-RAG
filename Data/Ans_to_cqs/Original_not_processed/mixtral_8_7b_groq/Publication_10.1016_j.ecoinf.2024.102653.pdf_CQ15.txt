Answer:::

The optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context is Adam, which is a method for stochastic optimization (Kingma and Ba, 2017). Adam is a popular optimization algorithm that is widely used in deep learning due to its efficiency and effectiveness. It is an extension of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, which is a fundamental optimization technique in machine learning.

Adam combines the advantages of two other optimization algorithms, AdaGrad and RMSProp, to adaptively adjust the learning rate during training. The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls the size of the steps taken in the direction of the negative gradient during optimization. Adaptive learning rate adjustment allows for faster convergence and better generalization of the model.

The Adam optimization algorithm uses a running average of the gradient and the squared gradient to compute the adaptive learning rate. This running average is computed over the entire training dataset, making it computationally efficient and suitable for large-scale deep learning applications.

In the given context, the Adam optimization algorithm is used to train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for toxicovigilance. The RNN model is designed using a series of processes described in Fig. 2, which includes data collection, preprocessing, and model evaluation. The hyperparameters used for training the RNN model are listed in Table 1, which includes the learning rate, batch size, epochs, dropout rate, and loss function.

In summary, the optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context is the Adam optimization algorithm, which is a popular and efficient method for stochastic optimization in deep learning.
