Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. However, it does mention several studies that use various machine learning methods for land cover classification and digital soil mapping.

In the study by Duan et al. (Ecological Informatics 81(2024)1025636), they used four methods for land cover classification: Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Random Forest (RF). It is likely that they used some form of hyperparameter tuning for these methods, but the specific methods used are not mentioned.

The study by Liu et al. (Geoderma 357, 2020) used a graded proportion method for training sample selection in digital soil mapping. While they do not explicitly mention hyperparameter tuning, they do use a validation set to assess the accuracy of their model.

The study by Lu et al. (Photogramm. Eng. Remote Sens. 76 (10), 2010) used QuickBird imagery for land cover classification in a complex urban-rural landscape. They used MLC and SVM for classification, but again, the specific methods used for hyperparameter tuning are not mentioned.

The study by Lu et al. (2021) used optimal segmentation scale selection for high spatial resolution images. They used a combination of texture features and machine learning algorithms, but there is no mention of hyperparameter tuning.

The study by Saboori et al. (Int. J. Remote Sens. 40 (22), 2019) combined multi-scale textural features from high spatial resolution images with ANN and MLC classification algorithms. They used a grid search algorithm for hyperparameter tuning.

The study by Sheykhmousa et al. (Arab. J. Geosci. 9 (18), 2020) compared Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for digital soil mapping. They used a trial-and-error approach for hyperparameter tuning.

The study by Mohammadi and Toomanian (Arab. J. Geosci. 9 (18), 2016) used a database extension method for digital soil mapping using artificial neural networks. They used a genetic algorithm for hyperparameter tuning.

In summary, while many of the studies mentioned in the context use machine learning methods for classification and mapping, only a few mention specific methods for hyperparameter tuning. These methods include grid search, trial-and-error, and genetic algorithms. It is likely that other studies used similar methods, but the specific methods are not mentioned in the context.
