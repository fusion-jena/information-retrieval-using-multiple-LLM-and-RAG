Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are no specific preprocessing steps mentioned in the given papers or texts that were taken before training deep learning models. However, it is well-known in the field of machine learning and deep learning that data preprocessing is an essential step before training models. Common preprocessing steps include data cleaning, normalization, and scaling.

Data cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and duplicate data points. Normalization is the process of rescaling numeric columns to a common range, often between 0 and 1, to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model's learning process. Scaling is similar to normalization, but it rescales the data to have a specific distribution, such as a standard normal distribution.

In the context of the paper "A review of some techniques for inclusion of domain-knowledge into deep neural networks" by Dash et al., 2022, it is mentioned that they used the GlorotNormal initializer of Keras for initializing the parameters of their deep learning model. The GlorotNormal initializer initializes the weights of the model with a truncated normal distribution, which is a type of normalization.

Furthermore, in the paper "Probabilistic Deep Learning: With Python, Keras and TensorFlow Probability" by Duerr et al., 2020, they used normal priors with zero mean and unit variance for their Bayesian Neural Networks. This is another type of normalization, where the weights of the model are initialized with a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models, it can be inferred that normalization was performed during the initialization of the parameters of the models. However, other preprocessing steps such as data cleaning and scaling may have also been performed but are not mentioned in the provided context.
