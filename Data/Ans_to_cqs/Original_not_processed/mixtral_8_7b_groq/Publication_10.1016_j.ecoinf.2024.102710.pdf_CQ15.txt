Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipelines. However, it mentions the use of several pre-trained models, which implies that some form of transfer learning was used. In transfer learning, a model trained on one task is re-purposed on a second related task, which can improve performance and reduce training time.

The pre-trained models mentioned include VGG16 and ResNet152V2, which are trained on the ImageNet dataset, a large dataset of images labeled with 1000 categories. These models were likely trained using some form of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which is a common optimization technique for deep learning. SGD involves iteratively adjusting the model's weights in the direction that minimally reduces the loss function.

The BirdNET model is also mentioned, which is a model trained to recognize bird sounds. The context suggests that the authors used the last layer before the classification layer of the BirdNET model, referred to as BirdNet-1, as an embedding model. However, the optimization technique used to train BirdNET is not specified.

In addition to transfer learning, the context also mentions the use of active learning, which is a technique where the model selects the most informative samples to label, rather than labeling a random subset of the data. Active learning can reduce the number of labels required to train a model, which can be useful when labeling data is time-consuming or expensive.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipelines, it suggests that transfer learning and active learning were used. The pre-trained models mentioned were likely trained using some form of SGD, which is a common optimization technique for deep learning.
