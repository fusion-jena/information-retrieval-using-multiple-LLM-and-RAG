Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, there is some information about regularization methods in the context of machine learning algorithms.

Support vector machines (SVMs) use a deterministic approach to choosing points or support vectors to define the boundary between classes, which can help reduce computational cost and time. This method can be seen as a way to prevent overfitting by limiting the complexity of the model.

Random forests, on the other hand, use a different approach to prevent overfitting. According to Breiman (2001), random forests reduce the variance of the model without increasing its bias by introducing randomness during the construction of decision trees. This randomness comes from two sources: (1) using a random subset of features to split at each node and (2) building each tree on a different random subset of the training data. This method helps to decorrelate the trees and reduce overfitting.

While these methods are not explicitly called regularization techniques, they share the same goal of preventing overfitting by limiting model complexity. Dropout, a popular regularization technique in deep learning, can be seen as a way to introduce randomness into the model by dropping out neurons during training. L2 regularization, another common deep learning regularization method, adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights, which helps to reduce overfitting by limiting model complexity.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, it does discuss methods used in machine learning algorithms to prevent overfitting by limiting model complexity. Random forests use randomness during tree construction, while support vector machines use a deterministic approach to choosing support vectors. These methods share similarities with deep learning regularization techniques such as dropout and L2 regularization, which also aim to prevent overfitting by limiting model complexity.
