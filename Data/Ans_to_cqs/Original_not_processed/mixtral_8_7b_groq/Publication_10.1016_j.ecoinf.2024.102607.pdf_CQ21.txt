Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training for the land use and land cover (LULC) classification models discussed in the article. However, it is common practice in machine learning and remote sensing applications to calculate various metrics and generate visualizations such as confusion matrices and saliency maps to evaluate the performance of the trained models.

In the context of LULC classification, generating a confusion matrix would be a relevant postprocessing step. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the classification results by comparing them with the ground truth data. It provides insights into the performance of the classifier by showing the number of correctly and incorrectly classified samples for each class. From the confusion matrix, various metrics such as overall accuracy (OA), kappa coefficient, and producer's and user's accuracy can be calculated to assess the quality of the classification.

Saliency maps, on the other hand, are used to visualize the importance of input features in the classification process. They can help identify which spectral bands or spatial regions contribute the most to the classification decision. However, the context does not mention the use of saliency maps in the postprocessing steps.

Considering the methods presented in the article, the authors focused on addressing the problem of unbalanced training data in LULC classification using various sampling techniques and comparing the performance of different models. They introduced a tile model combined with a multiple probabilistic classification model, which outperformed the traditional overall model in terms of classification accuracy. Additionally, they explored the impact of different tile sizes on the classification performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps after model training, generating a confusion matrix and calculating related metrics would be common and relevant steps for evaluating the performance of LULC classification models. Saliency maps could also be used to gain insights into the importance of input features, but there is no indication in the text that they were employed in this study.
