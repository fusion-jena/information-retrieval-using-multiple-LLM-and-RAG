Answer:::

The performance of deep learning models can be evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. It is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of a model. However, it may not always provide a reliable estimate of the model's performance, especially if the dataset is imbalanced.

Precision, also known as positive predictive value, is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions. It measures the proportion of correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.

Recall, also known as sensitivity, is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive samples. It measures the proportion of correctly identified positive samples out of all actual positive samples.

F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced evaluation of both metrics. It is a more reliable metric than accuracy, especially for imbalanced datasets.

AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) is a metric used to evaluate the performance of binary classification models. It measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve (a plot of true positive rate vs. false positive rate). AUC-ROC provides an aggregate measure of performance across all possible classification thresholds.

In the provided context, the deep learning models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. The Semi-supervised Contrastive Learning DNN model achieves an accuracy of 89.4%, precision of 99.8%, F1-score of 0.883, and AUC-ROC of 0.917. The Weakly-supervised XGBoost Ensemble model achieves an accuracy of 94.0%, precision of 99.5%, and F1-score of 0.936. However, AUC-ROC is not provided for the Weakly-supervised XGBoost Ensemble model.
