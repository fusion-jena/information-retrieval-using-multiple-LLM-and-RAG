Answer:
The data used for training the deep learning model in this study was split based on a 60-40 distribution, with 60% of the data from the years 2005 to 2015 being used for training and the remaining 40% from 2016 to 2018 being reserved for validation and testing purposes. This data partitioning approach is a common method for evaluating the performance of machine learning models.

The training dataset is used to teach the model the underlying patterns and relationships present in the data. By using data from an earlier time period (2005-2015), the model is able to learn from historical data and establish a basis for understanding the relationship between the input parameters and the output variable.

The validation and testing datasets, on the other hand, serve as a means to assess the model's ability to generalize its learning to unseen data. The validation dataset is used during the model training process to fine-tune the model's parameters and prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model becomes too specialized to the training data and performs poorly on new data. The testing dataset, which is completely separate from both the training and validation datasets, is used as the final evaluation of the model's performance.

In this study, the performance of the model was evaluated using several statistical metrics, including Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and predictive capability of the model by measuring the deviation between the predicted values and the actual observed values.

In summary, the data for deep learning model training was split based on a 60-40 distribution, with 60% of the data from 2005 to 2015 being used for training and the remaining 40% from 2016 to 2018 being reserved for validation and testing purposes. This approach allows for the evaluation of the model's ability to learn from historical data and generalize its learning to new, unseen data.
