The provided context does not directly discuss data augmentation techniques applied in deep learning pipelines such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does discuss the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and machine learning algorithms in the study of land use and land cover change detection.

In the context of remote sensing and image analysis, data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling can be used to increase the size of the training dataset and improve the robustness of the model. These techniques can help the model generalize better to new, unseen data by creating variations of the existing data.

For example, in the study by Al-Dousari, Mishra, and Singh (2023), machine learning algorithms such as multi-layer perceptron neural networks (MLPNNs) were used to detect land use and land cover change in the Kuwait metropolitan region. While the study does not explicitly mention data augmentation techniques, it is possible that they were used to preprocess the Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) data.

In another study by Alshari, Abdulkareem, and Gawali (2023), artificial intelligence (ANN-RF) was used to classify land use/land cover. Again, while the study does not explicitly mention data augmentation techniques, they could have been used to preprocess the data and improve the model's performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss data augmentation techniques, they are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for remote sensing and image analysis. Techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling can help increase the size of the training dataset and improve the robustness of the model.
