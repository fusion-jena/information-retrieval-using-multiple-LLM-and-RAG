Answer:::

The provided context discusses two metrics, AUC (Area Under the Curve) and mAP (mean Average Precision), that are used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model in the context of cetacean vocalization detection.

The AUC metric is a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between true positive and false positive predictions. It is a threshold-independent metric that provides an overall measure of the model's performance.

The mAP metric, on the other hand, is a measure of the model's precision at different recall levels. It is a threshold-dependent metric that provides a more detailed view of the model's performance at different operating points.

Additionally, the context also mentions F1 score, which is a measure of the model's accuracy, precision, and recall. It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a balanced assessment of the model's performance in terms of both false positives and false negatives.

It is worth noting that these metrics are used to compare the performance of the model trained with expert annotations and models trained with non-expert annotations. The study found that the performance of the model trained with expert annotations is always higher than the mean performance obtained with models trained with non-expert annotations, but the null hypothesis that the performance of the model trained with an expert annotation does not significantly differ from performance obtained with models trained on non-experts annotations cannot be rejected.

In conclusion, AUC, mAP, and F1 score are the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in cetacean vocalization detection. These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's ability to distinguish true positive from false positive predictions, its precision at different recall levels, and its accuracy, precision, and recall.
