Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The article by DeLancey et al., titled "Comparing Deep Learning and Shallow Learning for Large-Scale Wetland Classification in Alberta, Canada," discusses the results of comparing deep learning and shallow learning methods for wetland classification. However, it does not mention where the code repository is located. You may consider contacting the authors directly or looking for the repository on popular platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
