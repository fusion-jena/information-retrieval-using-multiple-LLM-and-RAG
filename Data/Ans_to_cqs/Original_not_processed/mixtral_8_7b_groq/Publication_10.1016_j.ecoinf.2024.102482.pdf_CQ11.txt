Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. There are several studies mentioned that use machine learning models, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and ConvLSTM, for various applications in ecology and environmental science. However, none of them explicitly state the data repository link for their deep learning pipelines.

An example is the study by Concepcion et al. (2023), which developed a hybrid deep neural network for common cockle (Cerastoderma edule) geographical traceability based on shell image analysis. Although the paper describes the methodology and architecture of their model, it does not provide a link to the data repository.

Similarly, Mortezavi et al. (2023) compared LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM for hourly short-term streamflow forecasting using deep learning approaches. However, the paper does not mention any data repository link for their models.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
