The provided context does not include specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the studies mentioned. However, it does provide information about the types of data used in these studies, such as high-resolution remotely sensed imagery, land-use types data, and soil property data.

In general, for remote sensing and image processing tasks, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in an image. It is commonly used for object detection tasks, where the goal is to identify the presence and location of specific objects within an image.
2. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves dividing an image into multiple regions, with each region corresponding to a specific class or object type. It is used for image segmentation tasks, where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image according to its corresponding object or class.
3. Instance segmentation: This technique is an extension of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and labeled individually. It is used for tasks where the number and location of individual objects need to be identified, such as in object detection and tracking.

For the studies mentioned, it is likely that one or more of these data annotation techniques were used to prepare the data for deep learning analysis. However, without specific information from the studies, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
