The provided context does not give detailed information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for BirdNET. However, it does mention the creation of the "Agmon annotated dataset" for evaluating BirdNET's performance. The dataset comprises over 10,900 annotated recordings of more than 75 species, with annotations carried out by experts skilled in species identification through vocalizations.

In the context of deep learning for computer vision tasks, common data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in images. It helps the model learn to detect and classify objects within the bounding boxes.

2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves creating a mask for each object instance in an image, allowing the model to learn the precise shape and location of each object.

3. Semantic segmentation: Similar to instance segmentation, this technique involves creating a mask for each class of object in an image. However, it does not differentiate between individual object instances.

Given that BirdNET focuses on avian diversity monitoring using audio recordings, it is likely that the annotation process for the "Agmon annotated dataset" involved labeling audio segments with the corresponding bird species rather than using visual annotation techniques like bounding boxes or segmentation masks.

To determine the specific data annotation techniques used for BirdNET, one would need to consult the original paper or related resources that provide more detailed information about the dataset creation and annotation process.
