Answer:::
I am unable to provide the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the given context. The text provides information about a study that used deep learning tools for bat acoustic signal detection and compared the performance of different methods. However, it does not mention where the data or the code for the deep learning pipeline is stored or hosted. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the data repository.
