Answer:
The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for insect ecoinformatics are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the trap images and associated programming code are available online for this study. Therefore, it can be inferred that the dataset used in this study is a collection of trap images, which were collected and annotated for this specific research.

In general, deep learning models for computer vision tasks like image classification are often trained on benchmark datasets such as MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, CIFAR for object recognition, and ImageNet for large-scale image classification. These datasets are widely used in the research community for developing and comparing deep learning models. However, the provided context does not indicate that any of these benchmark datasets were used in this study.

In summary, while the specific datasets used in this study are not mentioned, it can be inferred that the dataset consists of trap images collected for insect ecoinformatics research. The study did not use any of the standard benchmark datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
