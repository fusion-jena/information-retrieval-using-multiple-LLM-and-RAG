Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the described deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the use of active learning and hyperparameter tuning for a deep convolutional neural network (ResNet-50) model used in bird call recognition.

The paper by Sankupellay and Konovalov (2018) discusses the application of a deep convolutional neural network for bird call recognition, but it does not mention data augmentation techniques. Similarly, Thakur et al. (2019) present a deep metric learning approach for bioacoustic classification, but they do not discuss data augmentation techniques in their methodology.

Kahl et al. (2021) introduce BirdNET, a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring, but the paper does not provide specific details about data augmentation techniques used in their pipeline.

In summary, while data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling can be beneficial in deep learning pipelines, particularly for image data, the provided context does not mention their use in the described bird call recognition projects.
