Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct link to a deep learning pipeline code repository. However, there are several resources that may be useful in developing or locating such a pipeline.

The first resource is a GitHub repository for Sentinel-2 cloud masking using the s2cloudless algorithm (Braaten, 2020). This repository contains code for processing Sentinel-2 data and could serve as a starting point for developing a deep learning pipeline.

The second resource is a paper by Uwimana et al., 2018a, which discusses the use of remote sensing data to assess wetland use intensity (WUI) in East Africa. While the paper does not provide a deep learning pipeline, it does discuss the use of machine learning techniques for processing remote sensing data.

The third resource is a paper by Beuel et al., 2016, which presents a rapid assessment of anthropogenic disturbances in East African wetlands using remote sensing data. Again, while this paper does not provide a deep learning pipeline, it may be useful for understanding the types of data and analyses used in wetland research.

Finally, the Sentinel-2 mission, as described in Berger et al., 2012, provides high-resolution optical imagery that could be used as input for a deep learning pipeline.

To develop a deep learning pipeline for processing remote sensing data, one could start by exploring these resources and adapting existing code and methods to their specific research question. It may also be useful to consult with experts in remote sensing and machine learning to ensure that the pipeline is appropriately designed and validated.
