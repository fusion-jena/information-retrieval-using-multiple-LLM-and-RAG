Answer:::
The pieces of context provided do not explicitly mention which deep learning framework was used to build the model. However, it is mentioned that the model uses Yolov5x6, which is a variant of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection system. YOLOv5x6 is typically implemented using the PyTorch framework. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the deep learning model was built using PyTorch.
