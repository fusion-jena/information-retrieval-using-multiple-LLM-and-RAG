Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that Recursive Feature Elimination and Cross-Validation (RFECV) is used for feature selection, and in this process, five-fold cross-validation is utilized to select the number and combinations of features. This suggests that cross-validation is being used in the training process, but it does not specify how it is being used to determine when training is complete.

In general, in machine learning, there are several common criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as:

1. Validation loss plateau: Training is stopped when the validation loss stops decreasing or starts increasing, indicating that the model is overfitting to the training data.
2. Early stopping: Training is stopped when the performance on a validation set stops improving for a certain number of epochs.
3. Patience: Training is stopped if the performance on a validation set does not improve for a certain number of epochs, or if the improvement is below a certain threshold.
4. Number of epochs: Training is stopped after a fixed number of epochs, regardless of the performance on the validation set.

It is possible that one or more of these criteria are being used in the training process described in the context, but it is not possible to determine for certain based on the information provided.
