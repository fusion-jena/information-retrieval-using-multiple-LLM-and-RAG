Answer:::
The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link related to it. The context mainly discusses a cellular automaton model for simulating the spread of wildfires or pest plants, focusing on modifications to the update criterion, optimizing the scope, and strategies of variance-reduction. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
