Answer:

The pieces of context provided do not directly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do imply the use of remote sensing techniques and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data for training deep learning models in the context of geographic space and semantic segmentation.

Remote sensing is a technique that involves the acquisition of information about the Earth's surface through the analysis of data acquired by sensors on aircraft or satellites (Liu et al., 2008). This method allows for the collection of large-scale data over extensive areas, making it an ideal choice for training deep learning models for geographic space analysis.

LiDAR, on the other hand, is an active remote sensing technology that uses laser light to measure distances to the Earth's surface, providing highly accurate and detailed information about the terrain and vegetation (Lopatin et al., 2015, 2016). LiDAR data has been used in various studies to estimate vascular plant richness and model vascular plant species richness using LiDAR data in natural forests (Lopatin et al., 2015, 2016).

In addition to remote sensing and LiDAR, public datasets may also be used for training deep learning models. However, the pieces of context provided do not explicitly mention the use of public datasets.

Therefore, it can be inferred that remote sensing and LiDAR are the primary methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for geographic space analysis and semantic segmentation.
