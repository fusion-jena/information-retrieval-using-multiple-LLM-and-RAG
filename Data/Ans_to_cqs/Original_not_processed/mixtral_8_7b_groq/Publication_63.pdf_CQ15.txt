Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline in the study employing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) utilizes the RMSprop optimizer for training the model. The RMSprop optimizer is a type of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) that adjusts the learning rate based on the moving average of the squared gradients. This approach helps in smoothing out the oscillations in the gradients and results in faster and more stable learning.

The RMSprop optimizer was used with a learning rate of 0.001 and a learning rate decay of 0.0001. The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration, while the learning rate decay reduces the learning rate over time, preventing overshooting and improving the model's generalization.

The chosen loss function for the training process was mean squared error (MSE), which measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. The prediction accuracy was quantified by the MAE (mean absolute error) of the respective dataset.

The training process involved a batch size of 20 images, and the models were trained until the validation MAE did not further improve compared to the preceding epochs and diverged from the training MAE, indicating overfitting.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in the study utilizes the RMSprop optimizer, a type of SGD, with a learning rate of 0.001 and a learning rate decay of 0.0001. The loss function used was mean squared error, and the prediction accuracy was quantified by the MAE. The training process involved a batch size of 20 images and continued until the validation MAE did not further improve.
