Answer:::

 Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the details of the study, such as the use of drone thermal imagery, the enhanced faster R-CNN based on ResNets and FPN, and the detection of deer. However, it does not mention or provide a link to the code repository used in the study. It is possible that the authors have not made the code publicly available, or it may be available through a different source. Therefore, I am unable to provide a code repository link based on the given context.
