Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. The study specifically mentions using ResNet-50, a deep learning model, to extract features from image backgrounds for classification. The images are pre-trained with the ImageNet database, and the input to the network is an image of 224x224 pixels. Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in this context uses image data format. There is no mention of using audio, video, or CSV data formats in the pipeline.
