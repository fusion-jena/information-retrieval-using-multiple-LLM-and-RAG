Answer:::

The text provided gives information about the training of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for remote sensing image classification, specifically using GoogLeNet and ResNet-based models. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to ensure the generalizability of the model such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

But, it does mention that data augmentation techniques were used to increase the size of the dataset from 100 to 6000 images. These techniques include random horizontal flipping, random cropping, and random brightness and contrast adjustment. Data augmentation helps to increase the size and diversity of the training set, which can help to improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Additionally, the models were initialized with pre-trained weights from ImageNet, a large-scale dataset consisting of over 1.28 million images from 1000 generic object classes. Using pre-trained weights from a large and diverse dataset like ImageNet can help to improve the initial performance of the model and reduce overfitting.

Fine-tuning was also used, where the last learnable layers of the CNN were gradually adjusted to the particularities of the problem, while the first layers of the network, which extract low-level features, were kept fixed. This approach can help to ensure that the model is learning the right features for the task at hand, while still leveraging the pre-trained weights from ImageNet.

In summary, the text mentions the use of data augmentation, pre-trained weights, and fine-tuning, which can all contribute to the generalizability of the model. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
