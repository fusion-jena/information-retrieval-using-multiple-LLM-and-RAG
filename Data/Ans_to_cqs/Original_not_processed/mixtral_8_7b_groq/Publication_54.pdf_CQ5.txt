Answer:::

The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for training and testing the Inception-ResNet-v2 model in the study conducted by Huang and Basanta are not explicitly named as standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, based on the context provided, it can be inferred that the dataset used consists of images of endemic bird species. The dataset was initially split into 3,132 images for training and 760 images for testing. To augment the training dataset, it was increased 10 times, resulting in a total of 31,320 images, out of which 25,056 images were used for training and 6,264 images were used for validation. Additionally, 760 images, which were excluded from the training and validation datasets, were used for testing the model's ability to generalize to previously unseen domains present in the image.
