Answer:::

I regret to inform you that there is no code repository link provided in the given context for the deep learning pipeline. The context mainly focuses on the application of various machine learning techniques, such as Random Forest, Continuum Removal, and Convolutional Neural Networks, for estimating soil nutrient concentrations using visible and near-infrared spectroscopy. However, it does not include any information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository link.
