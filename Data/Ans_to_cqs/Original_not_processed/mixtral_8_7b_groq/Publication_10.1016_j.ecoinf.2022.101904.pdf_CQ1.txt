The provided context does not directly discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of remote sensing imagery for wetland mapping in the context of deep learning. Remote sensing typically involves the use of sensors on satellites or aircraft to capture images or other forms of data about the Earth's surface.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of public datasets in the training of deep learning models for wetland mapping. These datasets are likely to have been created through a combination of survey methods, sensor data, and other sources.

In general, the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline can vary widely depending on the specific application. Surveys, sensors, and public datasets are all common sources of data, but other methods such as scraping data from websites or using APIs to collect data from online services may also be used.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of remote sensing imagery and public datasets for wetland mapping. In general, the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline can include surveys, sensors, public datasets, and other sources depending on the specific application.
