The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including overall accuracy, producer accuracy, user accuracy, and the kappa coefficient of agreement. Overall accuracy is the ratio of the sum of correctly classified pixels to the total number of pixels in the test dataset. Producer accuracy refers to the accuracy from the mapmaker's point of view, while user accuracy represents the probability that a pixel classified in each category corresponds to the actual category on the ground. The kappa coefficient of agreement is a statistical measure that evaluates the agreement between the predicted and actual categories.

Additionally, errors of omission and commission are calculated for each land-cover-land-use (LCLU) class to better assess the performance of the DNN model. Errors of omission represent the proportion of reference data pixels that the model incorrectly classifies, while errors of commission correspond to the proportion of model-predicted pixels that were incorrectly classified according to the reference data. These accuracy metrics should be considered together when evaluating the model's performance.

It is worth noting that the optimization process for the DNN model considers three main factors: the model's accuracy, computation time and costs, and commonalities and differences between hyperparameters. The optimization algorithms are executed to find the highest accuracy from 1,788,160 hyperparameter combinations, and the model is trained for 200 epochs for each trial to find three DNN architectures. These models are then trained for the entire dataset for 1000 epochs.

However, the provided context does not mention the use of precision and recall as metrics to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives, while recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. These metrics can be useful in evaluating the performance of the model, especially when dealing with imbalanced classes. Nonetheless, the provided context indicates that the model's performance is primarily evaluated using overall accuracy, producer and user accuracy, the kappa coefficient, and errors of omission and commission.
