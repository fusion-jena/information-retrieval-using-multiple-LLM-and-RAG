Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of methods such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization techniques. The text focuses on describing the experimental configurations and the results obtained from those experiments. It is possible that the hyperparameters were optimized using a method that is not specified in the text, or perhaps they were not optimized at all and the default hyperparameters were used. Without additional information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this question.
