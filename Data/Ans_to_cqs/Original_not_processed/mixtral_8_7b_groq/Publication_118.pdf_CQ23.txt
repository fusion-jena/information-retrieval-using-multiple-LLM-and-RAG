Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, there are some indications that the authors may have taken steps to evaluate the model's performance and robustness.

Firstly, the authors used a subset of the total dataset to compare the variance and standard deviation of bcubed and purity evaluation metrics for feature representations found using Spectral Indices, MFCC, and Auto Encoder over 20 runs. This suggests that they may have performed some form of repeated evaluation or cross-validation to assess the model's consistency and variability.

Secondly, the authors used a basic auto-encoder architecture to minimize complications that may be introduced by more advanced architectures. This decision may indicate a concern for model simplicity and interpretability, which can sometimes improve generalizability.

Thirdly, the authors used rectified linear unit (ReLU) based activation functions to help mitigate the vanishing/exploding gradient problem. This technique can improve model training and convergence, which can indirectly contribute to generalizability.

However, these inferences are based on limited information, and it is possible that the authors did not take any specific measures to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Therefore, a definitive answer cannot be given based on the provided context.
