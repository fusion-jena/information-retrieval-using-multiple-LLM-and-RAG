Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model cannot be explicitly determined as the type of model or its specific task (classification, segmentation, detection, etc.) is not mentioned. However, we can infer that the model in question is a MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) model, which is a machine learning method used for predictive modeling and probability distribution.

The MaxEnt model is used in this context to estimate the relative contributions of environmental, territorial, and geographical variables in explaining the occurrence of two species, Quercus pubescens Willd. and Quercus ilex subsp. ilex. The variables include temperature factors (bio4, bio8, bio9), precipitation factors (bio13, bio19), and geographical factors (slope, aspect, etc.). The model's output is analyzed by calculating the percentage contribution and permutation importance of each variable.

The percentage contribution determines the jackknife, which is a statistical method used to estimate the variance of a statistic by repeatedly leaving out one observation from the sample and calculating the statistic for the remaining observations. In this case, the increase in regularized gain is added to the contribution of the corresponding variable in each iteration of the training algorithm.

Permutation importance shows the values of that variable on training presence, and background data are randomly permuted. The model is then reevaluated on the permuted data, and the resulting drop in training AUC (Area Under the Curve) is shown, normalized to percentages.

Therefore, while the specific purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the model is used for predictive modeling and probability distribution to estimate the relative contributions of various environmental, territorial, and geographical factors in explaining the occurrence of the two species.
