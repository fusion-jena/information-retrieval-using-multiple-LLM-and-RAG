Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning techniques in the analysis of images and videos, specifically for features extraction, instance segmentation, and tracking of animals in wildlife videos. Therefore, the data formats used in these deep learning pipelines are primarily image and video formats.

The first piece of context describes a deep learning model for feature extraction from images. This model comprises three convolutional layers: Conv-BatchNorm-SiLU integration module (CBS), Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks (ELAN), and Hybrid Convolutional (MPConv). These layers are designed to learn various features from images through different convolutional streams.

The second and third pieces of context discuss instance segmentation and tracking of animals in wildlife videos. These tasks require processing video data, which consists of a series of images. The fourth piece of context also refers to detecting mammals in UAV images, which again involves processing image data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the data formats used in these deep learning pipelines are primarily image and video formats. The image formats could be any format that can be used in computer vision tasks, such as JPEG, PNG, or TIFF. Similarly, the video formats could be any format that can be used in video processing tasks, such as MP4, AVI, or MOV.

The context does not mention the use of other data formats, such as audio or CSV files. However, it is important to note that deep learning techniques can be applied to various data formats, depending on the specific task. For instance, audio data can be used in speech recognition or music information retrieval tasks, while CSV files can be used in regression or classification tasks with tabular data.

In summary, based on the provided context, the data formats used in the deep learning pipelines for features extraction, instance segmentation, and tracking of animals in wildlife videos are primarily image and video formats. However, deep learning techniques can be applied to various data formats, depending on the specific task.
