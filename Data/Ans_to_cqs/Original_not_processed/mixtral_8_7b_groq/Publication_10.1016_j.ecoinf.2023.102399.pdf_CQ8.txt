Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context includes details about the authors, their affiliations, and the abstract of the study, which focuses on a fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on a deep neural network.

The abstract mentions that the proposed method minimizes the workload and complexity of image preprocessing, thereby increasing the efficiency and robustness of body weight estimation. However, it does not provide information about the code repository or where the implementation of the deep learning pipeline can be found.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it falls outside the information provided in the context. If the code repository is available, it may be hosted on a platform such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but the context does not provide a link or reference to it.
