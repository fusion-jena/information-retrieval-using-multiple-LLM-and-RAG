Answer:::

 Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context consists of several research papers published in Ecological Informatics, specifically by E. Prasetyo and colleagues in 2024. These papers discuss various topics related to ecological informatics, such as freshwater fish species, clustering techniques, and spatial analysis. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or any code repository links.

 It is important to note that research papers primarily focus on presenting and discussing the methodology, results, and implications of their scientific investigations. They might not always include details about the code repository or implementation, especially if the primary goal of the paper is to share the scientific findings rather than the computational methods.

 Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
