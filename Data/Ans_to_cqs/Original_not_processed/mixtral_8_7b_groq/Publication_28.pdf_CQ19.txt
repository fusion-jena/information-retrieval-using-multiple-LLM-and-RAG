The context provided does not give specific information about which deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, are used in the satellite image classification studies. However, it does provide details about the types of models and techniques used for training these models.

In the study by Li et al. (2014), a free search krill herd algorithm is used for functions optimization, but the specific deep learning framework is not mentioned. Li et al. (2020) combine a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a graph neural network for multi-label remote sensing image scene classification, but the framework is not specified.

Liu et al. (2020) use feature augmented convolutional neural nets for satellite image classification, but the deep learning framework is not mentioned. Unnikrishnan et al. (2019) employ red and near infrared band data for SAT-4 & SAT-6 datasets classification using novel DL frameworks for three distinct networks (VGG, Alex-Net, ConvNet) with hyper-tuning and input as 2 band data. Kadhim and Abed (2019) produced an efficient method for classifying satellite images using CNN for extracting features with the help of VGG19, AlexNet, Resnet50 pretraining, and GoogLeNet modules, but the deep learning framework is not specified.

Additionally, the context describes the use of Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for satellite image classification. VAE is a generative model that can be trained using the maximization of the variational lower bound L(q) related to the data point x. The VAE model consists of an input layer, various autoencoders (AEs), and an output layer. During training, an unsupervised pre-training step is implemented, followed by a supervised fine-tuning step that employs the backpropagation (BP) technique for learning the entire network parameters. However, the deep learning framework used for implementing VAE is not mentioned.

Therefore, while the context provides valuable information about the models, techniques, and data used for satellite image classification using deep learning, it does not give specific details about the deep learning frameworks used.
