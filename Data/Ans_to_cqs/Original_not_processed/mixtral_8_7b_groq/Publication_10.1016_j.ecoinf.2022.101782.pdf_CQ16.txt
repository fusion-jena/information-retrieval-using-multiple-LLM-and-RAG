Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it mentions that the best model was selected based on the minimal validation loss that occurred at epoch 448. This suggests that the training might have been stopped or at least closely monitored based on the validation loss behavior. A common practice is to stop the training when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model is overfitting to the training data. However, the exact criteria in this case are not specified in the provided context.
