Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the use of bespoke neural networks for species identification and low power neural networks in hardware, but it does not mention where the code for this pipeline is hosted. It is possible that the code has not been made publicly available, or it may be hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to this query.
