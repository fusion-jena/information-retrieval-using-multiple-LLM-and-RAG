Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of remote sensing data from the GF-6 satellite and pre-processing techniques, as well as the implementation of CART and Random Forest Regression (RFR) models for bathymetry retrieval. However, it does not mention any details about the data repository or where it is hosted. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
