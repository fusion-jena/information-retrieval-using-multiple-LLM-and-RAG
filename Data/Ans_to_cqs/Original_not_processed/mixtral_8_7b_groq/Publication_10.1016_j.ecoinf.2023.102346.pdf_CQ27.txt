Based on the provided context, there is no information about the deployment of a trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the use of machine learning algorithms for predicting species distributions and microbial community functions. It mentions the testing of various machine learning algorithms such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Generalized Boosting regression Model (GBM), and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT) for habitat suitability prediction.

However, it does not mention any details about the deployment of a deep learning model. The process of deploying a deep learning model typically involves model serialization, platform selection, and integration with an application or a system. Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model into a file, which can be later loaded and used for making predictions. Platform selection involves choosing the appropriate hardware and software environment for deploying the model. Integration with an application or a system involves connecting the deployed model with an application or a system that can use the model for making predictions.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as there is no information provided in the context about the deployment of a trained deep learning model.
