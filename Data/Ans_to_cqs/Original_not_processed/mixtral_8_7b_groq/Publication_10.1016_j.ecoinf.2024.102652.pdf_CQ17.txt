Answer:::

The provided context discusses the training process of a deep learning model for soil salinity prediction using remote sensing data, but it does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. However, based on the common practices in deep learning, I can provide some possible regularization techniques that could have been used in this pipeline.

1. Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are dropped out during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of feature detectors. In other words, dropout introduces noise into the network, forcing the other neurons to learn more robust features.

2. L2 Regularization: L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the sum of the squares of all the model's weights. This penalty term discourages large weight values, leading to a smoother and simpler model that is less likely to overfit.

3. Early Stopping: The context mentions using early stopping, where the learning process is halted if there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. Early stopping can be seen as a form of regularization since it prevents the model from further training and overfitting to the training data.

4. Data Augmentation: Data augmentation is a technique where the training data is artificially expanded by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, or flipping. This can help the model generalize better and prevent overfitting by providing more diverse training examples.

5. Batch Normalization: Batch normalization standardizes and normalizes the inputs of each batch, which can help reduce internal covariate shift and improve generalization.

While these techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting, the context does not explicitly mention which ones were used in this specific case. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based solely on the provided context.
