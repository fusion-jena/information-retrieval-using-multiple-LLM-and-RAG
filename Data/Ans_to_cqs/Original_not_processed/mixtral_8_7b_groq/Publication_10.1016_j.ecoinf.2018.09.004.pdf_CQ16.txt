Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the machine learning algorithms. Common criteria used in machine learning models include validation loss plateau, convergence of model parameters, or reaching a maximum number of training iterations. However, these criteria are not specified in the context.

In the given text, there is a detailed explanation of the dataset, evaluation metrics, and the cross-validation method used for training and testing the machine learning algorithms. The models are evaluated using Precision, Recall, and F-measure, and ranked based on the F-measure. The dataset is not balanced, with the Cymodocea class being the dominant one, making Accuracy an unsuitable evaluation metric.

The cross-validation method used is stratified cross-validation, where in each fold, a balanced number of instances for each class is selected. The number of folds used is 10. However, the criteria for determining when training is complete for the models are not mentioned.

Answer:::
The provided context does not contain information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the machine learning algorithms. Common criteria include validation loss plateau, convergence of model parameters, or reaching a maximum number of training iterations.
