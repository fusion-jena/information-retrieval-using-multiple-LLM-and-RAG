The provided context does not include information about deep learning pipelines or datasets commonly used in deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context focuses on grassland ecosystems, remote sensing, and machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest (RF) algorithm.

In the study, RF was applied using SAGA software (version 9.4.0) and QGIS software for classification based on Red Green Blue (RGB) images acquired in March, April, and May. The RF algorithm was tested with different maximum shaft number values (from 1 to 100) and minimum sample number values (from 1 to 50). The most accurate results for RF were obtained when the maximum tree depth was set to 10 and the minimum number of samples was set to 2.

The context also highlights the importance of grasslands, their role in the global ecosystem, and the use of remote sensing and machine learning techniques for monitoring and managing grasslands. However, it does not provide any information about deep learning pipelines or datasets.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
