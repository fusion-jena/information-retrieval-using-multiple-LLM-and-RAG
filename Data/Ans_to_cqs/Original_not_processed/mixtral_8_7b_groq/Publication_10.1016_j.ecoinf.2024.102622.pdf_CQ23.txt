Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the deep learning model being used in the study. However, it does mention the use of five modeling methods: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), extreme gradient boosting (XGboost), and multiple linear regression (MLR). Among these, MLP is a type of artificial neural network, which is a category of deep learning models. Therefore, I will assume the query is asking about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the MLP model.

The study ensured the generalizability of the MLP model through several measures. First, they used a diverse dataset for training and validation. The dataset consisted of vegetation indices (VIs) and leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) values from various crop coverage levels (low, medium, and high) in Northeast China. This diverse dataset helped the model to learn the underlying patterns in the data, which improved its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Second, the study used a validation set to evaluate the performance of the MLP model. The dataset was split into a training set and a validation set in a ratio of 3:1. The MLP model was trained on the training set, and its performance was evaluated on the validation set. This allowed the researchers to assess the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Third, the study compared the performance of the MLP model with other modeling methods, such as RF, SVM, XGboost, and MLR. This comparison helped to ensure that the MLP model was not overfitting the training data and that it was indeed capturing the underlying patterns in the data.

Finally, the study extended the MLP model to Northeast China in 2023 to indicate the strong generalization ability and robustness of the proposed model. The R2 value in Northeast China was as high as 0.85, which was significantly higher than the R2 value of the estimation model without considering crop coverage. This result further demonstrated the strong generalization ability and robustness of the MLP model.

In summary, the study ensured the generalizability of the MLP model by using a diverse dataset, evaluating the model's performance on a validation set, comparing it with other modeling methods, and extending it to a new region. These measures helped to ensure that the MLP model was not overfitting the training data and that it was indeed capturing the underlying patterns in the data.
