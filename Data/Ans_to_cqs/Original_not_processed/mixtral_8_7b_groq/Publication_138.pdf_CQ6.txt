Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include pooling, local response normalization (LRN), dropout, and possibly other steps such as normalization or scaling that are not explicitly mentioned.

In the described model, after each convolution layer, the pooling operator is used to extract the main features of a certain area, reduce the number of parameters, and prevent overfitting. Specifically, maximum pooling with a 2 Ã— 2 window and 2 strides is used, resulting in a reduced data size. After pooling, LRN is applied to normalize the local response, enhancing larger response values and reducing smaller ones, which can improve the model's generalization.

Additionally, a dropout layer is used after the tenth layer to improve the model's generalization capability. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps prevent overfitting.

While the context does not explicitly mention other preprocessing steps such as normalization or scaling, these techniques are commonly used in deep learning to ensure that the input data is in a consistent range and to speed up learning. Normalization involves scaling the input data to a range of [0,1] or a standard normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Scaling can also involve other transformations, such as mean subtraction or dividing by the standard deviation.

Therefore, based on the provided context and general deep learning practices, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include pooling, LRN, and possibly normalization or scaling. Dropout is used after training to improve generalization.
