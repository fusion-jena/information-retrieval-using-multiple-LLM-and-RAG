Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific information about the regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting. However, it does mention the use of a regularization technique called dropout in reference [66] - "Dropout: A simple way to prevent neural networks from overfitting." Dropout is a regularization technique used in neural networks where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons.

In addition to dropout, other regularization methods commonly used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting include L1 and L2 regularization. L1 regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of the coefficients, while L2 regularization adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of the coefficients. These regularization techniques work by adding a penalty to the loss function, which encourages the model to have smaller weights and thus be less prone to overfitting.

Therefore, while the specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned in the provided context, it is reasonable to assume that the authors may have used dropout, L1 or L2 regularization or a combination of these techniques to prevent overfitting.
