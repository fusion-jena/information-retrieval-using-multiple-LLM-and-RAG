Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The text mainly focuses on a study about land degradation and the methods used for data collection and analysis.

However, it is common practice in machine learning and data analysis to use certain criteria to determine when training is complete. These criteria can include:

1. Validation loss plateau: Training is stopped when the validation loss stops decreasing or starts increasing, indicating that the model is overfitting to the training data.
2. Early stopping: Training is stopped when the performance on a validation set stops improving for a certain number of epochs.
3. Patience: Training is stopped if the performance on a validation set does not improve for a certain number of epochs.
4. Maximum number of epochs: Training is stopped after a predetermined maximum number of epochs.

These criteria help prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well to new data. The specific criteria used would depend on the specific model and dataset being used.
