The provided context discusses various models and techniques used in deep learning, but it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on common practices in the field, I can provide a general overview of some data annotation techniques that are often used.

Annotation is the process of labeling data so that machine learning models can learn to recognize and categorize patterns. There are several annotation techniques used in computer vision, a key area of deep learning. Here are some of them:

1. Image-level annotation: This is the simplest form of annotation where an image is labeled with a single class or category. For example, an image may be labeled as "dog" or "cat."
2. Bounding box annotation: In this technique, a bounding box is drawn around an object of interest in an image. This helps the model to learn the spatial location and size of the object. For example, a bounding box may be drawn around a dog in an image to indicate its location.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class or category. This helps the model to learn the precise shape and location of objects in an image. For example, each pixel in an image of a dog may be labeled as "fur," "eye," or "nose."
4. Instance segmentation: This is a more advanced form of semantic segmentation where each instance of an object is segmented and labeled separately. This helps the model to learn the number and location of objects in an image. For example, each dog in an image may be segmented and labeled separately.
5. Keypoint annotation: In this technique, key points or landmarks are identified and labeled in an image. This helps the model to learn the spatial relationships between different parts of an object. For example, key points may be identified and labeled in an image of a human body to indicate the location of joints.

The provided context discusses CLIP, a model that uses natural language supervision to learn visual concepts. This suggests that CLIP may use image-level annotation or bounding box annotation, as these techniques are commonly used for training models that learn visual concepts from natural language. However, the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific annotation techniques used for CLIP.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, common practices in the field include image-level annotation, bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and keypoint annotation.
