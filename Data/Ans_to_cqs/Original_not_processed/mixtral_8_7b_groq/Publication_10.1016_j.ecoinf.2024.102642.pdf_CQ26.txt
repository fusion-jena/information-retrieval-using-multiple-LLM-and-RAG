The provided context discusses various methods used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cetacean vocalization detection using deep learning models. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

The context does mention that multi-annotation campaigns involving both expert and novice annotators are used to address the challenges associated with the scarcity of ground truth data in underwater Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) studies. This approach could potentially help reduce data bias by incorporating diverse perspectives and levels of expertise in the annotation process.

Furthermore, the context highlights the importance of initial annotator training being as representative as possible of the datasets proposed and in line with the difficulty of the task. This suggests that careful consideration is given to the selection and training of annotators to minimize data bias.

The context also discusses the impact of annotation sets' permissiveness or conservativeness on model performance. It implies that instructing annotators to adopt a more conservative approach could be beneficial, which may help reduce false positives and thus data bias.

However, the context does not provide enough information to answer the query definitively. Therefore, based on the provided pieces of context, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
