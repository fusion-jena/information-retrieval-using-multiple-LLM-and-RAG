Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated. However, it is mentioned that data augmentation was used to diversify the training data, and this was achieved using a 3-s window length. Common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning include flipping, rotation, and scaling. Given that the overall process followed current best practices in deep learning, it is reasonable to assume that some or all of these techniques were used.

Flipping is a technique where the input data is horizontally or vertically flipped to create new training examples. This can help the model learn to recognize features that are invariant to orientation.

Rotation involves rotating the input data by a certain angle to create new training examples. This can help the model learn to recognize features that are invariant to orientation and can also help improve the model's ability to generalize to new viewpoints.

Scaling involves changing the size of the input data to create new training examples. This can help the model learn to recognize features that are invariant to scale and can also help improve the model's ability to generalize to new scales.

Overall, while the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated in the provided context, it is reasonable to assume that some or all of the common techniques such as flipping, rotation, and scaling were used. These techniques can help improve the training sample diversity and the model's ability to generalize to new data.
