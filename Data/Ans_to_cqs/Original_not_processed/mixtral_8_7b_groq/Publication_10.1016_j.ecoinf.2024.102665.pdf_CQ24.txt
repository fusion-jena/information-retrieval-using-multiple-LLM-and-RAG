Answer:::

The provided context does not contain direct information about strategies employed to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines. However, it does mention the use of a random walk in an expectation-maximization process for clustering and constructing a na√Øve Bayesian network.

In the context of the paper by Do and Tran (2023), a random walk is used in the automated expectation-maximization process to minimize the Minimum Description Length (MDL) score for identifying the optimal number of cluster states. The random walk starts with a 'guess' or initial distribution over the cluster and reef states, then iteratively checks and improves this guess until it converges to a stable solution. This process introduces randomness, as the initial guess is randomly determined, which can help explore different possible cluster configurations.

In the context of machine learning and deep learning, randomness can be handled in various ways:

1. Random seed value: Deep learning models often use random initializations for weights and biases. A fixed random seed value ensures consistent and reproducible results across multiple runs.

2. Data shuffling and splitting: Data is often shuffled before splitting it into training, validation, and testing sets. This introduces randomness, as the model will learn from different subsets of the data in each run.

3. Regularization techniques: Techniques like dropout, weight decay, and early stopping introduce randomness by preventing overfitting and encouraging the model to learn more general features.

4. Ensemble methods: Techniques like bagging, boosting, and stacking combine multiple models trained on different subsets of the data or with different architectures. These methods introduce randomness by averaging the predictions of multiple models, reducing the variance and improving the generalization of the final model.

While the provided context does not directly discuss these strategies, the use of a random walk in the expectation-maximization process demonstrates an example of how randomness can be employed in machine learning and data analysis.
