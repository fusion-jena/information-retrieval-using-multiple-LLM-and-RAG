Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or any code repository link, such as a link to GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The context consists of an ecological informatics paper's authorship contribution statement, a declaration of competing interest, data availability, acknowledgments, and a figure depicting the spatial distribution of implementation areas for ecological engineering programs in China. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
