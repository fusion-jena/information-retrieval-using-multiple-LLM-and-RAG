Answer:::

The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for detecting Pacific oysters in this study are the VisDrone dataset and the COCO dataset. The TPH-YOLOv5 model was pre-trained with the VisDrone dataset, while the YOLOv5m, YOLOv5s, and FR-CNN models were pre-trained on the COCO dataset. These pre-trained models were then fine-tuned for detecting Pacific oysters.

The VisDrone dataset is a large-scale dataset for object detection in drone videos, which contains 2513 high-resolution images and 10,209 video clips. It covers various scenarios and includes 10 categories of objects with challenging aspects such as motion blur, various scales, and occlusions.

The COCO dataset (Common Objects in Context) is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. It contains 330,000 images, with 80 object categories, and 91 stuff categories. The images are annotated with object bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and five caption sentences.

These two datasets were chosen because they contain diverse scenarios, objects, and annotations, which can help the deep learning models to learn more generalizable features and improve their performance in detecting Pacific oysters.
