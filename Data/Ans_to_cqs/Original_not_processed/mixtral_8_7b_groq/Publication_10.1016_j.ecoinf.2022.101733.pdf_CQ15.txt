The provided pieces of context do not directly mention the optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. However, they do discuss the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) in remote sensing and ecological informatics applications.

SVM is a popular machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification and regression tasks. It is based on the concept of finding the optimal hyperplane that can best separate two classes of data. SVM uses a kernel function to transform the data into a higher dimensional space, where it is easier to find the optimal hyperplane. The parameters of the SVM model, such as the type of kernel function and the regularization parameter, need to be optimized to achieve the best performance.

In the context of remote sensing and ecological informatics, SVM has been used for various applications such as mapping food and agriculture trends, glacier segmentation, and paddy rice mapping. The parameters of the SVM model are typically set based on default values or tuned using cross-validation techniques. However, the provided context does not mention any specific optimization techniques used for SVM or deep learning algorithms.

In summary, while the provided pieces of context discuss the use of SVM in remote sensing and ecological informatics applications, they do not mention any optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as SGD or Adam. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
