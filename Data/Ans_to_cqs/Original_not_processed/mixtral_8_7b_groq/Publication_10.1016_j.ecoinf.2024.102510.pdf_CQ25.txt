Answer:::
The deep learning models mentioned in the provided context are used for the classification of bird species based on their images or audio. 

In the first piece of context, several deep learning models are compared based on their performance in classifying bird species. The metrics used to evaluate their performance, such as validation accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are commonly used in classification tasks. Therefore, it can be inferred that these models are used for bird species classification.

In the second piece of context, the authors use a deep learning model to classify bird species audio. They propose an Augmented Convolutional Neural Network (ACNN) model for this task. The fact that they use audio data and not images, as well as the name of the model, further supports the idea that this model is used for classification.

In the third piece of context, the authors use deep learning models for bird sound recognition in complex acoustic environments. While they do not explicitly mention the type of task, the name of the competition, Birdclef, suggests that it involves bird sound classification.

In the fourth piece of context, the authors present Birdnet, a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring. Birdnet uses deep learning models to classify bird songs and calls, which is a specific type of classification task.

Overall, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that the deep learning models are used for classification tasks, specifically for classifying bird species based on their images or audio.
