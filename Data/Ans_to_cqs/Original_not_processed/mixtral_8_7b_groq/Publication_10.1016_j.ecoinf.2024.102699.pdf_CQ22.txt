Answer:::

The specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in the provided context are not explicitly stated. However, there are some clues that can help us infer which metrics might have been used.

In the first piece of context, "Evaluation and Performance Metrics for Machine Learning and Computer Vision," the title suggests that it discusses various metrics for evaluating machine learning and computer vision models. However, it is not a direct reference to the specific models or metrics used in the other pieces of context.

In the second piece of context, "Learning to monitor birdcalls FromWeakly-labeled focused recordings," the authors do not mention any specific evaluation metrics. They do, however, mention that they used three deep learning models and compared their performance.

In the third piece of context, "Grad-CAM: Why Did you Say that?" the authors introduce Grad-CAM, a technique for visualizing the features that a deep learning model focuses on when making a prediction. While this is related to model interpretability and not directly to performance evaluation, it is mentioned in the context of deep learning models.

In the fourth piece of context, "Grad-CAM: Visual Explanations from Deep Networks using Gradient-based Localization," the authors again focus on model interpretability and do not mention any specific evaluation metrics.

In the fifth piece of context, "The evaluated augmentation techniques consistently exhibited the same qualitative effects across all three of our deep learning models," the authors compare the performance of different augmentation techniques for deep learning models. They mention that if the performance of an augmentation set improved for one model, it also improved for the other two, and vice versa. This suggests that they used a consistent evaluation metric across all models, but it is not specified which metric they used.

Based on the available context, we can infer that the authors likely used common evaluation metrics for deep learning models, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. However, without explicit mention of the metrics used, we cannot provide a definitive answer.
