The provided context does not directly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss a study that utilized data from the third and fourth natural environment surveys to assess the impact of urban development on species distribution. Therefore, we can infer that the data for this study was collected through environmental surveys.

Environmental surveys often involve a combination of fieldwork, remote sensing, and analysis of existing data sources. For example, researchers may conduct on-site observations and measurements of various environmental variables, such as temperature, humidity, and soil composition. They may also use remote sensing technologies, like satellite imagery, to gather data on larger scales or in harder-to-reach areas. Additionally, they might analyze existing public datasets, such as those maintained by government agencies or other research institutions, to supplement their own data collection efforts.

In the context of the study mentioned, the researchers focused on two specific study sites that underwent rapid urban development. They likely collected data on land usage, vegetation, and wildlife populations at these sites, both before and after urban development. This information would have allowed them to assess how urbanization affected species distribution and inform future urban planning efforts.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state the methods used for collecting raw data, it can be inferred that environmental surveys, fieldwork, remote sensing, and analysis of existing data sources were employed. These methods are common in ecological and environmental research and allow researchers to gather comprehensive data on various environmental variables and processes.
