Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the deep learning pipeline. However, the text does discuss the use of both labeled and unlabeled data in deep learning for tree detection, with a focus on addressing the challenge of limited training data in remote sensing.

In a semi-supervised framework, labeled data is combined with the deep learning model to improve its performance on limited training data. This is achieved by allowing the neural network to learn generalized features from a wider array of training examples, followed by retraining on a smaller number of high-quality annotations. It is unclear whether moderate to low-quality annotations can be used to generate trees for initial model training due to the imperfect nature of existing unsupervised tree delimitation approaches.

Self-supervised learning is another approach to addressing the data limitation in deep learning for remote sensing. This method uses unsupervised methods to generate training data that is then used to train supervised models. Self-supervision relies only on unlabeled data and has been recently applied to remote sensing for hyperspectral image classification.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, it does discuss the use of both labeled and unlabeled data in deep learning for tree detection. Specifically, it highlights the use of a semi-supervised framework and self-supervised learning to address the challenge of limited training data in remote sensing.
