Answer:::

I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on discussing different deep learning models such as LeNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG-19, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNet152, and ICSNet, comparing their accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC, and min-batch size. It also explains the architecture of ICSNet, which is based on the inception module from GoogLeNet but has fewer layers than VGG-19 and ResNet. However, there is no mention of the code repository link for this deep learning pipeline.
