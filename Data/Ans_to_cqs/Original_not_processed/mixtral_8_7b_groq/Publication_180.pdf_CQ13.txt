Based on the provided context, the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for automated species identification of Chagas disease vectors, such as Triatominae, are not explicitly mentioned. The text focuses on the adjustment of two parameters in TensorFlow: validation percentage and number of training steps.

However, the text does not mention any details about learning rate or optimizer selection. The learning rate determines the size of the steps in the gradient descent process, while the optimizer is the algorithm used to find the minimum of the loss function during training. Common optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, and Adam.

In the context, the authors discuss the trade-off between the correct identification rate and processing time when determining the number of training steps. They found that, for the Mexican dataset with 12 species, 2,000 training steps resulted in an 83.0% overall identification rate. However, the specific learning rate or optimizer used in their model is not provided.

To provide a complete answer, it would be necessary to have more information about the deep learning model's architecture and the specific hyperparameters used during training. Nonetheless, the context provides valuable information about the dataset, the use of TensorFlow for species identification, and the importance of selecting appropriate training parameters.
