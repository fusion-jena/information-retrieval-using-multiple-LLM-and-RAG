Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the research by Kim et al. (2024). The context discusses the methodology and approach used in the research, including the use of satellite imagery, deep learning models, and phenological characteristics for land cover classification. However, it does not mention where the data repository is located.

The research by Kim et al. (2024) builds upon previous studies such as those by Jagannathan and Divya (2021), Jin et al. (2016), and Kathryn Bickel et al. (2006), but these studies do not provide information about the data repository for Kim et al.'s research either.

Moreover, the references to Kim et al.'s other works (2021a, 2021b) do not mention the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. These works focus on the classification accuracy and performance of deep learning models for land cover classification.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in Kim et al.'s research (2024) is not available. It is recommended to contact the authors directly for more information about the data repository.
