Answer:::

The provided context discusses the data splitting approach in the context of few-shot learning for meta learning methods and deep learning models for bioacoustic applications. However, it does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets.

In general, the data splitting approach for deep learning models involves dividing the available data into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

In the context of few-shot learning, the data splitting approach is slightly different. The available data is divided into a support set and a query set. The support set is used to train the model, and the query set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen tasks. Transductive-based methods further utilize the information present in the unlabeled examples from the query set to adapt the model and improve its predictions.

In the bioacoustic application of deep learning, the data splitting approach is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that temporally-precise and fine-grained annotation of audio demands expertise, and is thus costly and time-consuming. This suggests that the data splitting approach may be influenced by the availability and quality of annotated data.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it can be inferred that the data splitting approach depends on the specific application and the availability and quality of annotated data.
