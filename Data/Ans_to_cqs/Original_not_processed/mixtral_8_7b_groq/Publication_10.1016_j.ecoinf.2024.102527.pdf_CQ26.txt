Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a particular approach used in data splitting to prevent bias and ensure better generalization of the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model.

In the context, when dealing with the SS dataset as the target domain dataset, the authors kept the integrity of events during data splitting. This means that all images of an event were placed in the same dataset, either training, validation, or test sets. This approach prevents bias that may arise from splitting images within the same event into different datasets, as images in the same event are significantly similar to each other.

While not explicitly mentioned as a technique to address data bias, this method of data splitting helps ensure that the model is exposed to a variety of events during training, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen events.

In summary, the context describes a specific data splitting approach to prevent bias and improve generalization in the DCNN model. However, it does not provide information on other techniques commonly used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
