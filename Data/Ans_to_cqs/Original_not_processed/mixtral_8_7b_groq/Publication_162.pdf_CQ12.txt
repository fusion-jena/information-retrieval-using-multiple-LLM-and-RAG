Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of a "backbone" and a "3 Ã— 3 convolution" in the feature fusion module. Both of these are components of a CNN. Additionally, the paper cited for the region proposal network (RPN) classifier and mask head, "Mask R-CNN" by He et al. (2017), is a well-known CNN-based model used for object detection and segmentation tasks.
