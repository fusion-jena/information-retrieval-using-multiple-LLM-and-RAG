Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, the context does provide information about various studies related to forest management, carbon sequestration, and remote sensing techniques for monitoring forest characteristics and biomass.

In the study by Tong et al. (2020), the authors investigated the impact of forest management practices on carbon sequestration in southern China. They used field survey data and remote sensing techniques to estimate carbon sequestration. However, they did not mention any specific strategy for monitoring the model performance during training.

The study by Torresani et al. (2023) used LiDAR GEDI-derived tree canopy height heterogeneity to reveal patterns of biodiversity in forest ecosystems. They used machine learning techniques to analyze the data, but there is no information about the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training.

Viana et al. (2012) estimated crown biomass of Pinus pinaster stands and shrubland above-ground biomass using forest inventory data, remotely sensed imagery, and spatial prediction models. However, they did not provide any details about monitoring the model performance during training.

Liu et al. (2018) studied the impact of ecological construction programs on grassland conservation in Inner Mongolia, China. They used remote sensing techniques to monitor grassland degradation, but there is no information about the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training.

Liu et al. (2022) used a neural network-guided interpolation approach to map canopy height of China's forests by integrating GEDI and ICESat-2 data. However, they did not mention any specific strategy for monitoring the model performance during training.

Lu (2007) discussed the potential and challenge of remote sensing-based biomass estimation. The author mentioned the importance of monitoring the model performance during training but did not provide any specific strategy.

Therefore, based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it is an essential step in developing and validating any machine learning or statistical model. Common strategies for monitoring model performance during training include using validation sets, cross-validation, early stopping, and learning rate schedules.
