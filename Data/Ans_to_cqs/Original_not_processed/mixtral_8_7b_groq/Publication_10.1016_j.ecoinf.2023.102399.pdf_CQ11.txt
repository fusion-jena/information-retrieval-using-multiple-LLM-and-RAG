Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. However, there are several papers and sources mentioned that are relevant to the topic of using deep learning for fish biomass estimation and underwater fish detection.

In the paper "Fully automatic system for fish biomass estimation based on deep neural network" by Zhang et al. (Comput. Electron. Agric. 173, 105439, <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compag.2020.105439>), the authors developed a deep learning-based system for fish biomass estimation. However, there is no information provided about the data repository link for this pipeline.

Another paper by Li et al. (Rev. Aquac. 12 (3), 1390–1411, <https://doi.org/10.1111/raq.12388>) reviewed nonintrusive methods for biomass estimation in aquaculture, including the use of deep learning. Again, there is no mention of a data repository link for any of the studies reviewed.

The paper "Cascaded deep network systems with linked ensemble components for underwater fish detection in the wild" by Labao and Naval (Eco. Inform. 52, 103–121, <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2019.05.004>) proposed a deep learning-based system for underwater fish detection. However, there is no information provided about the data repository link for this pipeline.

The paper "Convolutional neural network-based fish posture classification" by Li et al. (Complexity 2021, 1–9, <https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/9939688>) developed a deep learning-based system for fish posture classification. However, there is no information provided about the data repository link for this pipeline.

Finally, the paper "An automatic image-based system for estimating the mass of free-swimming fish" by Lines et al. (Comput. Electron. Agric. 31 (2), 151–168, <https://doi.org/10.1016/S0168-1699(00)00181-2>) developed an image-based system for estimating the mass of free-swimming fish. However, this system was developed using traditional computer vision techniques, not deep learning.

In summary, while there are several papers and sources mentioned that are relevant to the topic of using deep learning for fish biomass estimation and underwater fish detection, there is no information provided about a data repository link for any of the deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
