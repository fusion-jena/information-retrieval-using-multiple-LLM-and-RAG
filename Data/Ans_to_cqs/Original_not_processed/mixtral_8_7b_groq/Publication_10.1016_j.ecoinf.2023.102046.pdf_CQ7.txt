Answer:

The context provided does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it does mention that the model with the smallest validation loss was used for evaluation on the test set. This implies that there was a validation set used during the training process, and the model's performance was evaluated on this set after each epoch or batch of training to check for overfitting and to tune hyperparameters.

Additionally, the context mentions that the learning rate was set differently for different models, and the batch size was 4 for all models. These are other hyperparameters that would need to be tuned during the training process, and it is common to use a validation set for this purpose.

The exact criteria for splitting the data into train, test, and validation sets would depend on the specific dataset and the goals of the modeling project. A common approach is to split the data into training, validation, and testing sets in an 80-10-10 or 70-15-15 ratio, respectively. The training set is used for learning the model parameters, the validation set is used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection, and the testing set is used for evaluating the final model performance.

In summary, while the context provided does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it does imply that a validation set was used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection. The exact criteria for splitting the data would depend on the specific dataset and the goals of the modeling project.
