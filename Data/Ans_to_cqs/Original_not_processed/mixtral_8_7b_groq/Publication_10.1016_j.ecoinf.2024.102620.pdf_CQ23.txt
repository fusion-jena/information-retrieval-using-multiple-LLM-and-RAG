Answer:

 Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the use of a deep learning model in the study. The PLUS model mentioned in the text uses a transformed specification mining framework based on the land expansion analysis strategy (LEAS) module and a cellular automata (CA) model based on a multi-type random patch seed mechanism (CARS). The LEAS module employs the random forest algorithm to obtain the development probabilities of each land use type, but it does not mention the use of a deep learning model.

However, the study does describe some measures taken to ensure the validity and reliability of their model. For instance, they used a diverse dataset to train their model, including land use data, NDVI, DEM, temperature, precipitation, radiation, road data, GDP data, and population data. They also resampled some of the data to ensure a consistent spatial resolution.

Additionally, the study used a two-period land use dataset to train their model, which could be considered a form of temporal validation. They compared the model's predictions to the actual land use data from the second period to evaluate its accuracy.

However, the text does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or testing the model on a separate dataset. Therefore, it is unclear whether the study took any specific steps to ensure that the model would perform well on new, unseen data.

In summary, while the study describes some measures taken to ensure the validity and reliability of their model, there is no explicit information about the use of a deep learning model or any specific steps taken to ensure its generalizability.
