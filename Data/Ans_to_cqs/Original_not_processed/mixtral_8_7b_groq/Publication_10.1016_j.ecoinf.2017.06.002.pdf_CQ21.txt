Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context focuses on the data collection, organization, and linkage for measurement types synthesis, and it does not mention any specific postprocessing steps for model training.

However, the context does mention some general steps that can be involved in a data processing workflow, including data processing levels with related processing approaches and references to data file descriptions. These steps can include:

1. Data collection: This involves gathering data from various sources, including defining measurement positions, installing sensors, and collecting data files.
2. Data processing: This step includes data processing levels, such as raw data, translated/processed data, data originator QA/QC, and project-level QA/QC.
3. Data linkage and aggregation: This step involves spatiotemporal aggregation and linkage of measurement types for synthesis.
4. Metadata collection: This step includes targeted metadata collection that enables model-data integration.

While these steps do not specifically mention postprocessing steps after model training, they do provide a general framework for data processing that could include model training and postprocessing.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly answer the query, it is possible that postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, and Confusion matrix could be included in a broader data processing workflow that encompasses model training and evaluation.
