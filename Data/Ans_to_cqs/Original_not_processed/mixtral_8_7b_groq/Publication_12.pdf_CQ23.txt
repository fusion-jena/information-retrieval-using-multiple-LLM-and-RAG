Answer:::
The generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through several measures. Firstly, they modified BatNet and added new BNorm layers behind the 22 convolutional layers to prevent overfitting. This allowed the model to learn from trends in both "known" and "unknown" datasets rather than maximizing performance on the "known" datasets. This is a strategy to improve the model's ability to generalize.

Secondly, they used a large batch size of 128 during training, which means training with 128 images for each iteration. This allows the model to learn from a more diverse set of images at once, which can help improve its ability to generalize.

Thirdly, they used a filtered dataset (validation dataset) to test the model and different taxon bias. This provided an opportunity to evaluate the model's performance on a different dataset and fine-tune it accordingly.

Lastly, they tested the model on audio-files collected from a corridor for 15 species to lower misidentification and false positives. They also tested the model on audio-files recorded under different human and natural conditions. This provided a real-world testing scenario for the model, which can help ensure its generalizability.

However, the text does not explicitly mention the use of techniques such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
