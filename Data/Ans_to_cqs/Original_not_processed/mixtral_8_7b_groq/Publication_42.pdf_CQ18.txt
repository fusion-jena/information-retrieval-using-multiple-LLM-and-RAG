Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the F1-score, a harmonic mean of precision and recall, was used to evaluate the model's performance. This score was used to rank the CNN architectures, with the top 32 models trained using the Adam optimizer and the bottom 32 models trained using the SGD optimizer. The hyperparameters, including kernel sizes, convolutional depths, and fully connected sizes, varied for each model. The model with the highest F1-score of 92.75% was chosen as the final architecture. Additionally, the classifications were made with SVM based on manually defined features, achieving a counting and classification precision of 92.5% and 90.8%, respectively. The system was tested on a mostly unknown data material, with fewer than 1% of the images from the survey period used to train the CNN model.
