Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the described deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the training process and the use of a modified U-Net network for soil salinity mapping, but it does not mention any data augmentation methods. Data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to increase the amount and diversity of training data by applying random transformations to the existing data, such as flips, rotations, and scaling. However, without further information, it cannot be confirmed that these methods were used in this specific pipeline.
