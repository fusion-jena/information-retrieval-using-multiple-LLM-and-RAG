Answer:::
The deep learning model for evaluating the conservation status of Orchidaceae species was built using the TensorFlow framework. The researchers implemented a deep neural network algorithm as an R package, which is based on the Python (version 3.7) TensorFlow library. TensorFlow is a popular open-source platform for machine learning and artificial intelligence projects, known for its flexibility, scalability, and robustness in handling complex data sets and models. In this study, the authors used TensorFlow to train their model on a dataset of orchid species with IUCN Red List assessments and available occurrence records, and then used the model to predict the conservation status of all orchid species at two levels: binary (possibly threatened vs. not threatened) and detailed (CR, EN, VU, NT, and LC). By specifying the use of TensorFlow, the authors allow other researchers to reproduce and build upon their work, contributing to the advancement of machine learning applications in biodiversity conservation.
