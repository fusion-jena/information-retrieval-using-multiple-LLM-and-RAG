Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for the study in question. However, it does mention some types of data that were used, which can give us a general idea.

The study focused on floodplain forest ecosystem service value in the lower reaches of Tarim River, China. To generate high-precision Fractional Vegetation Coverage (FVC) in drylands, the researchers used high-resolution (0.8 m) remote sensing images. This suggests that they used satellite or aerial imagery as one source of data.

Additionally, the study used climate and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, which were resampled to 10 m spatial resolution through ArcGIS. This implies that these data were obtained from external sources, possibly public datasets or specialized providers.

Mean groundwater data, with a 10 m resolution, were derived from a Machine Learning model constructed based on groundwater monitoring data collected from 74 wells in the lower Tarim River Basin. This specific groundwater data collection method is not common in deep learning pipelines, as it involves creating a Machine Learning model to estimate the mean groundwater levels.

In summary, the study used satellite or aerial imagery, possibly public datasets or specialized providers for climate and DEM data, and groundwater monitoring data collected from wells in the lower Tarim River Basin. These data were then processed and used in deep learning models to generate high-precision FVC in drylands.

It is important to note that the methods used for collecting raw data can vary greatly depending on the specific application and the availability of data sources. In general, deep learning pipelines can use various data collection methods, including surveys, sensors, public datasets, and custom data collection methods, depending on the problem being addressed.
