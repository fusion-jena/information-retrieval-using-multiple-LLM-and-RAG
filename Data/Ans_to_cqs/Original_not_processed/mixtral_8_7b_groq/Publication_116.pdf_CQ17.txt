Answer:::
The text does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe other regularization techniques that are used.

One such technique is the use of an auxiliary classifier. This is a classifier that is added to the network and is trained to predict the class labels of intermediate layers in the network. This helps to ensure that the intermediate layers are learning useful features and are not just memorizing the training data.

Another technique that is used is data augmentation. This is the process of creating new training examples by applying transformations to the existing examples. In this case, simple crop and resize data augmentation is used, which involves randomly cropping and resizing the images in the training set. This helps to increase the amount of training data and can also help to reduce overfitting.

In addition, the text mentions the use of batch normalization. This is a technique that normalizes the activations of the neurons in a layer, which can help to improve the training of deep networks. Batch normalization can also act as a regularizer, by adding noise to the activations of the neurons.

Finally, the text describes the use of transfer learning, which involves initializing the model parameters from a pre-trained model. This can help to prevent overfitting by providing the model with a good starting point, and by allowing it to learn features that have been shown to be useful in other domains.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization, it does describe other techniques that are used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. These include the use of an auxiliary classifier, data augmentation, batch normalization, and transfer learning.
