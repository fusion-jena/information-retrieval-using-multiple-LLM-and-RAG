Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific framework used to build the deep learning model for any of the studies. The contexts mention the use of deep learning techniques and neural networks but do not specify the frameworks used to implement them.

For instance, Liu et al., 2022, used a neural network to guide the interpolation for mapping canopy height, but the specific framework is not mentioned. Similarly, Qin et al., 2022, used machine learning methods, including neural networks, for individual tree segmentation and tree species classification, but the framework remains unspecified.

In the context of forest management and carbon sequestration, Tong et al., 2020, mention the use of machine learning techniques without specifying the framework. The same applies to Torresani et al., 2023, who used LiDAR GEDI data for tree canopy height heterogeneity analysis.

In summary, while the contexts mention the use of deep learning and neural networks, there is no explicit information on the specific frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) used to build the models.
