Answer: The deep learning model described in the context is used for object detection in agricultural pest images. Specifically, it is a Faster R-CNN model that integrates a Region Proposal Network (RPN) for predicting object bounds and a Fast R-CNN for target detection in processed images.

The model's feature extractor network generates feature maps from the input image, which are then used by the RPN module to propose potential object locations on the feature maps. These proposed locations are then adjusted and classified by a regressor and classifier trained using a loss function. The classifier calculates the probability of each element in the feature map containing the target object, and the regions with the highest scores are selected as the detected target objects.

Therefore, the deep learning model's purpose is to detect and classify agricultural pests in images, which can be useful for monitoring and managing pest populations in agricultural settings. The RPN module's performance utilization with bounding box regression further enhances the model's ability to accurately detect and locate pests in images.

It's worth noting that the computational time of this deep learning approach is not a problem in this study, as the detection and classification procedures can be executed in a few seconds in a cloud computing system, saving all required hardware resources.
