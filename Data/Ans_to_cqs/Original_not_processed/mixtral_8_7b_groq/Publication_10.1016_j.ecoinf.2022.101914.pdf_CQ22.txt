Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the ensemble models include the Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC-ROC) and the True Skill Statistic (TSS). However, the context does not specify the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model.

The AUC-ROC is a metric used to assess the ability of a model to distinguish between positive and negative classes. It ranges from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates perfect discrimination, and a value of 0.5 indicates no discrimination ability. The TSS is a threshold-dependent accuracy measure that combines both sensitivity and specificity. It ranges from -1 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates perfect accuracy, a value of 0 indicates no better than random, and a value less than 0 indicates worse than random.

In the context, the TSS and AUC-ROC are calculated for each ensemble model using external evaluation datasets set aside prior to training models. The optimal number of background points for each individual modeling approach is determined based on these metrics.

However, the context does not mention any deep learning model. It only describes the evaluation of ensemble models using an averaging approach, where each ensemble model includes component models built with different numbers of background points. The evaluation of these ensemble models is done using the AUC and TSS metrics.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are not specified.
