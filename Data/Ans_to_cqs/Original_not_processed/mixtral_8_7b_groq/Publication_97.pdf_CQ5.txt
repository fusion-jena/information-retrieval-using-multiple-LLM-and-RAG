Answer:::

The provided context does not give information on the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet). However, it does mention the use of satellite images for training and validation in a remote sensing context.

In the experiment, satellite images for sites #1, #3, #5, #7–10 were used for training and #2, #4, #6 for validation. The training data were generated as batches of size (m, 256, 256, 3), where m is the batch size (m = 20 in their experiments). The batches consisted of sub-images of size 256 × 256 that were randomly cropped out from the original satellite images. They had a stream of almost never repeated sub-images; these sub-images were combined into batches and used for the neural network training.

Therefore, while the context does not provide information on the specific standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it does mention the use of satellite images for training and validation in a remote sensing context.
