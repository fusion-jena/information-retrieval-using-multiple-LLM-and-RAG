Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the comparison of classification results of adding a dynamic convolutional decomposition model on different models, such as MobileNetV2, ResNet18, and VGG16. It also discusses the dynamic convolutional kernel decomposition method proposed by Li et al. in 2021. However, there is no mention of the cloud platform or any other deployment platform used for these models.
