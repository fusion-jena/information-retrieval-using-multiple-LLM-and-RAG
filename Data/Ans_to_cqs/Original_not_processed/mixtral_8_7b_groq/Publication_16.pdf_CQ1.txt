Answer:::

The text does not provide a specific list of surveys or public datasets used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of acoustic sensors for data collection. These sensors are used to record garden birds, and the acquired audio is then automatically uploaded to the platform for classification. The system can interface with a variety of sensors for real-time inference, and where in-field communication is unavailable, audio files can be batch uploaded through the website for offline inferencing. Therefore, it can be inferred that acoustic sensors are the primary method utilized for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline.
