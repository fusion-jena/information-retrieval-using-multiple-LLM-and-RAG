Answer:::

In the context provided, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. This is mentioned in the sentence "For the object detection algorithm experiments in this study, specific format image annotation files were required for training. The AUDD provides annotation files in the MS-COCO format, which must be converted into a usable text format for the ground truth bounding box annotation files." Here, it is specified that the annotation files are in the MS-COCO format, which is a popular format for object detection and segmentation tasks, and that these files need to be converted into a usable text format for the ground truth bounding box annotation files. This indicates that bounding box annotation is being used in the deep learning pipeline.

Bounding box annotation is a technique where rectangular boxes are drawn around objects of interest in an image, and the coordinates of these boxes are used as labels for training object detection models. This technique is widely used in object detection tasks, as it allows the model to learn the location and size of objects within an image.

Instance segmentation, which involves labeling each pixel of an object in an image, is not explicitly mentioned in the context provided. However, it is possible that instance segmentation was also used in the deep learning pipeline, as the MS-COCO format supports both object detection and instance segmentation annotations.

In summary, based on the provided context, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. However, it is possible that instance segmentation was also used.
