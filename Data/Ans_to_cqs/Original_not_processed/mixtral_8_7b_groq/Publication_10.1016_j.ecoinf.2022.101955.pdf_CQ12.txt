Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the specific type of deep learning model used in the described pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. Deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers are not discussed.

However, the text does mention the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in the context of land use and land cover (LULC) classification. ANNs are a type of machine learning model that loosely mimic the functionality of the human brain. They consist of interconnected nodes or "neurons" and are used for tasks such as knowledge acquisition, recall, synthesis, and problem-solving.

In the described LULC classification pipeline, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) ANN model was specifically employed. The MLP is a type of feedforward ANN that is commonly used for supervised learning tasks. It uses backpropagation to adjust the weights of the connections between nodes, enabling the model to learn from input data and make predictions.

While ANNs, including MLPs, can be considered a part of deep learning due to their multi-layered structure, they generally do not possess the same level of complexity as more modern deep learning models like CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers. Therefore, without further information, it is reasonable to assume that the pipeline described in the context primarily utilizes an MLP ANN for LULC classification rather than a more advanced deep learning model.
