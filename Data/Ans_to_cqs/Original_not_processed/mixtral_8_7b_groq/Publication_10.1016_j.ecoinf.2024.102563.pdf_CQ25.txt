Based on the provided context, the specific deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned. However, there are references to various machine learning models used for image classification and analysis in remote sensing and digital soil mapping.

One of the studies, Zhong et al. (2019), used a deep learning-based multi-temporal crop classification model for Remote Sensing Environment. This model likely involves image segmentation and object detection tasks to classify crops accurately. Similarly, Zhu et al. (2008) discussed purposive sampling for digital soil mapping, which might involve deep learning models for predicting soil properties based on limited data.

In the context of remote sensing and image analysis, deep learning models are often used for image classification, segmentation, and object detection tasks. For instance, Zhang et al. (2023) researched the identification of land types and tree species in the Engebei ecological demonstration area based on GF-1 remote sensing. Similarly, Zhu et al. (2022) identified soybean based on Sentinel-1/2 SAR and MSI imagery under a complex planting structure. These studies might have employed deep learning models for image classification and object detection tasks.

In summary, while the specific deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, deep learning models are often used for image classification, segmentation, and object detection tasks in remote sensing and digital soil mapping applications.
