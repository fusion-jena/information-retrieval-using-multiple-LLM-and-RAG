The provided context does not give specific information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the research workflow includes a data processing and classification stage, which involves differentiation as a feedforward propagation (FP) algorithm to train neural networks using supervised learning based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

In general, techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline can include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the data into subgroups or strata based on certain characteristics, such as class labels, and then randomly sampling from each stratum to ensure that each subset of the data is representative of the overall data distribution.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of samples in a particular class to balance the class distribution. This can be done by duplicating existing samples or by generating synthetic samples using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of samples in a particular class to balance the class distribution. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of the samples from the majority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population or problem being studied. This can help to reduce bias and improve the generalizability of the model.

It is possible that one or more of these techniques were used in the data processing and classification stage of the research workflow, but the provided context does not give enough information to confirm this.
