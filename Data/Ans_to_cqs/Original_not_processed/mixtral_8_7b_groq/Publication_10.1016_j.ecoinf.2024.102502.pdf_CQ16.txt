Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the described workflow. The context focuses on data filtering, temporal scaling, and workflow applicability for spatio-temporal multiscale data extraction using Google Earth Engine and ground-based observations.

However, in general, when training machine learning models, several common criteria are used to determine when training is complete, such as:

1. Validation loss plateau: Training is considered complete when the validation loss stops decreasing or shows only a negligible improvement over a certain number of epochs. This indicates that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data, and further training may lead to overfitting.

2. Early stopping: This technique is used to prevent overfitting by stopping the training process when the validation loss starts increasing or when it fails to improve for a specified number of epochs.

3. Monitoring other metrics: Besides validation loss, other metrics like training loss, accuracy, F1-score, or AUC-ROC can be monitored to determine when training is complete.

4. Reaching a predefined number of epochs: Training can be set to stop after a predefined number of epochs, regardless of the performance on the validation set.

5. Patience: A hyperparameter called patience is used in early stopping techniques, which specifies the number of epochs to wait before stopping the training if the validation loss does not improve.

Since the context does not provide specific details about the training process or the model used, it is not possible to give a precise answer based on the given information.
