Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text mentions that a full description of the model architecture, dataset spatial split, and training procedure can be found in supplementary information (SI) Box A. However, it does not specify where the actual code implementation is located. Therefore, I cannot provide the desired information about the code repository being available on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
