Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the specific optimization method used for the hyperparameters of the model. The context discusses various studies related to land use/cover changes, vegetation changes, and climate change in China, but it does not mention any details about the optimization of hyperparameters in a model. Hyperparameter optimization methods such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization are typically used to find the best set of hyperparameters for a model, which can improve the model's performance. However, the specific method used for the model in question is not provided in the context.
