Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline for improving NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) reconstruction and long-term vegetation cover study primarily uses remote sensing data. Specifically, it uses data from sensors placed on satellites.

The Wang et al. (2023) study applies deep-learning enhanced fusion methods for improved NDVI reconstruction in the Danjiang River basin. The NDVI data is derived from satellite sensors, although the specific type of sensor is not mentioned in the study. 

The Wei et al. (2016) study selects the optimal NDVI time-series reconstruction technique for crop phenology detection. They use MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) NDVI time series data, which is collected by NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites.

The Zhou et al. (2015) study reconstructs global MODIS NDVI time series using the Harmonic ANalysis of Time Series (HANTS) method. Again, the NDVI data is derived from the MODIS sensor on NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites.

The Zhou et al. (2021) study further optimizes the estimate of global biome-specific parameter settings to reconstruct NDVI time series with the HANTS method. They continue to use MODIS NDVI data.

The Benedetti and Rossini (1993) study uses NDVI profiles for agricultural statistics, specifically for wheat yield estimate and forecast in Emilia Romagna. They use AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) NDVI data, which is collected by NOAA's polar-orbiting satellites.

The Bermudez et al. (2018) study uses SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) to optical image synthesis for cloud removal with generative adversarial networks. While not directly related to NDVI, this study also uses satellite data.

The Charizanos and Demirhan (2023) study predicts wildfire event probability using normalized difference vegetation index data from an Australian forest. They use Landsat satellite data, which is collected by the U.S. Geological Survey.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline for NDVI reconstruction and vegetation cover study primarily uses remote sensing data collected by various satellite sensors, including MODIS, AVHRR, and Landsat.
