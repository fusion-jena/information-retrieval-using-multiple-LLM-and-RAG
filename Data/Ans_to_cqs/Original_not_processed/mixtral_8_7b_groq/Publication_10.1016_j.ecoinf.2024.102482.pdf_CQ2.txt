Answer:::

Deep learning models can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and structured data like CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific application and the nature of the data being analyzed.

In the context of ecological studies, time-series data, such as hourly short-term streamflow measurements, are often used for deep learning models (Mortezavi et al., 2023). These data are typically stored in structured formats like CSV files, which can be easily processed and fed into deep learning algorithms.

For applications involving image data, deep learning models have been successfully applied to analyze and classify images of different types. For instance, Concepcion et al. (2023) developed a hybrid deep neural network for common cockle (Cerastoderma edule) geographical traceability based on shell image analysis. In this case, the raw data consists of images, which are then preprocessed and fed into the deep learning model.

Deep learning models have also been used for analyzing audio data. For example, Padovese et al. (2023) developed a deep learning model for vocalization detection of the North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis). In this study, the raw data is in the form of audio recordings, which are processed and transformed into a suitable format for deep learning analysis.

Video data can also be used in deep learning models. For instance, in the field of animal behavior analysis, deep learning models have been used to characterize temporal patterns in the swimming activity of Caenorhabditis elegans (Choi et al., 2012). In this case, the raw data consists of video recordings, which are then processed and analyzed using deep learning techniques.

In summary, deep learning models can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and structured data like CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific application and the nature of the data being analyzed. In ecological studies, time-series data and image data are commonly used for deep learning models.
