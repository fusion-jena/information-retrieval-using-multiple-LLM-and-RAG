Answer:

The provided context does not directly address the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. However, it discusses a novel transfer learning (TL) methodology called IFTL (Input Feature-wise Transfer Learning) that can be useful for predicting GDP using CO2 emission data when the training and testing data have different data distributions.

In conventional machine learning techniques, training and testing data are drawn from the same distribution. However, if the data distribution is changed between the training and test data, the performance and reliability of the predicted output may degrade significantly. This is where TL techniques like IFTL come in handy.

IFTL is a TL methodology that captures the uncertainty produced by extreme variations in data distribution or predictive tasks across the source and target data. It suitably restricts overconfidence for better learning while transferring the learned knowledge. IFTL outperformed FTL (Feature-wise Transfer Learning) when the training and testing domains (including labels) had huge data distribution differences.

The data splitting criteria for deep learning models typically involve dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

In the context of IFTL, the data splitting criteria could involve dividing the source and target data into training, validation, and testing sets. The source data could be used to train the model, and the target data could be used to validate and test the model's performance. However, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data splitting criteria used for IFTL.

Therefore, while the provided context discusses a TL methodology that can be useful for predicting GDP using CO2 emission data, it does not directly address the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
