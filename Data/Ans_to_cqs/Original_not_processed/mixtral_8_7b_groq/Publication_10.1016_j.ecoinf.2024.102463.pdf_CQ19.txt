Answer:::
The Keras library with TensorFlow backend was used to build the deep learning model. This information is provided in the context when it mentions that the "learning methods were developed using the freely available Keras library with TensorFlow backend." Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. The context also specifies that all methods were written in the Python language and in the PyCharm environment, which further supports that Keras was used to build the model.
