Based on the provided context, there are a few strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, specifically in the context of fine-tuning a base model with Gulf of Mexico data.

1. **Fixed Seed Value**: The context does not explicitly mention the use of a fixed seed value for reproducibility. However, it is a common practice in deep learning to set a fixed seed value to ensure reproducibility of results across different runs. This is not specifically mentioned, so it's unclear if it's being used.

2. **Cyclical Learning Rate**: The use of a cyclical learning rate can be seen as a strategy to handle randomness. A cyclical learning rate changes between a minimum and maximum value according to a schedule, rather than decaying geometrically as is common in many deep learning training procedures. This can help in escaping local minima and finding better solutions, thus handling the randomness associated with initial weights and gradient noise.

3. **Early Stopping**: Early stopping is another strategy to handle randomness. It is used to prevent overfitting and to save training time. If the validation loss does not improve within a certain number of epochs, the training is stopped. This can help in ensuring that the model does not get stuck in a particular region due to randomness in the data.

4. **Dropout and DropConnect**: Dropout and DropConnect are regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting. Dropout randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0 at each update during training time, which helps in preventing over-dependence on any one input feature. Similarly, DropConnect randomly sets a fraction rate of activations to 0 during training. These techniques introduce randomness during training, which helps in improving the generalization ability of the model.

5. **Data Acquisition and Labeling**: The context mentions the importance of labeling a pool of frames representative of the specific signal under various local conditions for optimum model performance. This can be seen as a strategy to handle the randomness associated with the data. By ensuring that the training data is representative of the actual data distribution, the model is less likely to be affected by the randomness in the data.

In conclusion, while the context does not explicitly mention the use of a fixed seed value, it does mention the use of strategies like cyclical learning rate, early stopping, dropout, dropconnect, and careful data acquisition and labeling to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
