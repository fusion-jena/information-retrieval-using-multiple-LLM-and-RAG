Answer:::
The hardware resources used for training the deep learning model include a MAC OS operating system and an Apple M1 chip processor. However, the specific information about the use of GPUs or TPUs is not provided in the context. The RAM size is 8 GB, and the model is implemented using Python 3.6.5 with TensorFlow 2.2.0 and Keras 2.4.0 development environment. The input dataset used for training is EMDS-6, which consists of 840 different images of environmental microorganisms having 21 categories with 40 images for each category. The input dimensions of the images are 224 Ã— 224, and the batch size is set to 32. The learning rate is set to 0.002, and the model is trained for 100 epochs using the AdamW optimizer and the activation function GELU. The default loss function cross-entropy is used to calculate the loss of the proposed network. The system configuration used for training and experiments of the proposed model is given in Table 2, but it does not mention any specific information about the use of GPUs or TPUs.
