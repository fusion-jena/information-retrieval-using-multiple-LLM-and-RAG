Answer:::

Regularization methods are techniques used in deep learning to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of models and discouraging overly large weights. The context provided mentions several regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.

One such method is weight decay, also known as L2 regularization. It adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This penalty term discourages large weights, preventing overfitting by reducing the model's capacity. However, the context does not explicitly mention the usage of L2 regularization in the overfitting setting.

Another important regularization method mentioned in the context is dropout. Dropout is a technique that randomly sets a fraction of the model's hidden units to zero during training. This prevents the co-adaptation of hidden units, encouraging the model to learn more robust features. In the no-overfitting setting, the context mentions a dropout rate of 0.5.

Batch normalization is another regularization technique mentioned in the context. It normalizes the inputs of each batch, reducing internal covariate shift and improving the model's generalization ability. In the no-overfitting setting, the context includes the use of batch normalization. However, it is removed in the overfitting setting to ensure that the model overfits.

The context also highlights the importance of using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as the optimization algorithm for preventing overfitting. SGD has been shown to have better generalization performance compared to other optimization algorithms.

In summary, the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, include weight decay (L2 regularization), dropout, and batch normalization. These methods are used in conjunction with SGD as the optimization algorithm and a smaller learning rate to reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalization ability.
