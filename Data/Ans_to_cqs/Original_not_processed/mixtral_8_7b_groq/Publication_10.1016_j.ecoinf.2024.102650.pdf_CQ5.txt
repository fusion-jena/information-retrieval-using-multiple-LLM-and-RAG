The provided context does not include information about the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.

However, the query asks about common datasets used in deep learning, so I can provide some examples of those. In the context of computer vision, some popular datasets include MNIST (a dataset of handwritten digits), CIFAR (a dataset of natural images), and ImageNet (a large-scale dataset of images with annotated objects). These datasets are often used to train and evaluate deep learning models for image classification, object detection, and other tasks.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, I can provide some common examples of datasets used in deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet.
