Answer:::
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context contains information about the methods and results of the study, including the use of deep learning and remote sensing data to estimate plant species richness in the Korean Peninsula. However, it does not mention where the data or code for the study can be found. Therefore, I am unable to provide a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
