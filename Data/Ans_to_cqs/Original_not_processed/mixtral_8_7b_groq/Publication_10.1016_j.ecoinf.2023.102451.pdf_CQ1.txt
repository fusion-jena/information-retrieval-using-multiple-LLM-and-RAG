The specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline described in the text are not provided. However, it is mentioned that a publicly available dataset of environmental microorganisms (EMDS-6) is used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. The dataset consists of 840 different images of environmental microorganisms, having 21 categories with 40 images for each category. Therefore, it can be inferred that the raw data for this study was collected in the form of microscopic images of environmental microorganisms, which were then used to create the EMDS-6 dataset. Publicly available datasets are a common source of raw data in deep learning pipelines, as they provide a standardized and accessible way to train and test models. Other methods for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines can include surveys, sensors, and other forms of data collection, depending on the specific application and task.
