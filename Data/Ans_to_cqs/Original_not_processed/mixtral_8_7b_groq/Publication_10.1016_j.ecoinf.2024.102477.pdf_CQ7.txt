Answer:::

In the context provided, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to split the data into three subsets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to train the model by adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the error on the training data. The validation set is used during the training process to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance. The validation set is used to tune hyperparameters, such as learning rate or regularization strength, and to prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor generalization to new data.

The testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance on data that the model has not seen during training or validation. The testing set provides an unbiased estimate of the model's ability to generalize to new data.

The criteria used to split the data into these subsets can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. A common approach is to randomly split the data into training, validation, and testing sets, with a ratio such as 60/20/20 or 70/15/15. Another approach is to use time series data and split the data into training, validation, and testing sets based on time. For example, the training set can consist of data up to a certain time, the validation set can consist of data from the next period, and the testing set can consist of data from the period after that.

In summary, while the context provided does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it is common practice to split the data into training, validation, and testing sets. The criteria used to split the data can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset.
