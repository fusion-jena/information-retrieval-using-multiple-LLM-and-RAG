The context does not provide specific information about the deep learning frameworks used to build the models. However, it can be inferred that both TensorFlow and PyTorch are possible candidates.

In the context, it is mentioned that the models are trained using the Adam optimizer. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch have built-in implementations of the Adam optimizer. The learning rate and other hyperparameters used in the optimization process are also mentioned, but these do not help in determining the framework used.

The context also mentions the use of perceptual loss, style loss, adversarial loss, L1 loss, and cross-entropy loss. These loss functions are commonly used in deep learning and are available in both TensorFlow and PyTorch.

The activation functions used in the models, such as ReLU and leakyReLU, are also available in both TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to definitively say which framework was used to build the models. However, both TensorFlow and PyTorch are possible candidates as they have the necessary components to implement the models described in the context.
