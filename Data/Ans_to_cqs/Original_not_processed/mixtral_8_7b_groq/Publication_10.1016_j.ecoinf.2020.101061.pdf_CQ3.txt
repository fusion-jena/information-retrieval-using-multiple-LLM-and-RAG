Answer:::
In the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that training tiles were manually annotated using the program RectLabel. RectLabel is a tool commonly used for drawing bounding boxes around objects in an image, which suggests that bounding box annotation was used. There is no mention of instance segmentation or other annotation techniques. It is also mentioned that there is some uncertainty in the bounding box extents, which is a common issue with bounding box annotation. Additionally, there is no attempt made to delineate understory trees that were not visible in the RGB imagery, indicating that the annotation was focused on the visible trees.

Furthermore, the study performed a sensitivity study by training models using different proportions of training data, including 0% hand-annotated data, to assess whether the addition of hand-annotated data improved the within-site pretraining. This suggests that the hand-annotated data was used for supervised learning, and the models were evaluated based on their performance on the task of interest.

In summary, based on the provided context, it appears that bounding box annotation was used for data annotation in the deep learning pipeline. However, there is no explicit mention of other annotation techniques such as instance segmentation.
