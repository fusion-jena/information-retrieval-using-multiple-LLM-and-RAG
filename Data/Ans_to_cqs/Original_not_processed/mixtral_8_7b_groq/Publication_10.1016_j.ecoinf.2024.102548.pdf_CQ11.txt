Answer:

The provided context does not include information about the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. There is no mention of any specific data repository or a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repositories where the data used in the study can be accessed. The context only discusses the methodology and techniques used in the study, such as transfer learning, data augmentation, and the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with LSTM and GRU cells. The datasets used in the study are okra leaves, with diseased and healthy leaves, but the source of these datasets is not provided. Therefore, I cannot answer this query without additional information.
