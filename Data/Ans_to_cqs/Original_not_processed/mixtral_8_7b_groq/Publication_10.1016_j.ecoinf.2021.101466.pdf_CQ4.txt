Answer:::

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as described in the provided context, include cropping, flipping, scaling, rotating, adding noise, and color transformation. These techniques were used to increase the size and diversity of the training set for a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model for image detection and classification.

Cropping involves selecting a portion of the original image to use as a new image. Flipping refers to horizontally flipping the image, which can help the model generalize better and be more robust to variations in object orientation. Scaling involves changing the size of the image, which can help the model handle objects of different sizes. Rotating involves rotating the image to different angles, which can help the model handle objects in different poses. Adding noise involves adding random noise to the image, which can help the model handle images with different levels of clarity. Color transformation involves changing the color balance or contrast of the image, which can help the model handle images with different lighting conditions.

In addition to these techniques, the paper also describes the use of synthesizing foreground images of pests onto background images with random erasing and image processing methods. These techniques were used to further increase the size and diversity of the training set for the EfficientNet model.

It is worth noting that the data augmentation techniques were applied to the training set only, and not to the validation or test sets. This is important to ensure that the model is evaluated on a representative sample of the data and to prevent overfitting.

In summary, the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline described in the provided context include cropping, flipping, scaling, rotating, adding noise, and color transformation. These techniques were used to increase the size and diversity of the training set for a CNN-based model for image detection and classification.
