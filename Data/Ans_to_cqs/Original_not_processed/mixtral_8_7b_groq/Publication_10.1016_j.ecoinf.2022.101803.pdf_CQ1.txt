The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of several datasets in the context of machine learning model training and evaluation.

The "Simulated Dataset in Matthiopoulos et al. (2015)" and "Simulated Dataset in Matthiopoulos et al. (2011)" are mentioned, but it is not clear how these datasets were generated. The "Sparrow population dataset" is also mentioned, which was used in a study by Aldossari et al. (2022). However, the context does not provide details on how this dataset was collected.

Based on the variables mentioned in relation to these datasets, it can be inferred that some of the data was likely collected through surveys or observations, as variables such as "food", "temperature", "population size", "cover", "grass", "bush", "roof", "colony size", "distance to high human use", "distance to edge", "slope", "burnt", "alpine", "shrub", "rock", and "herbaceous" suggest the collection of data related to the physical environment and the organisms present in that environment.

In addition to these datasets, the context also mentions the use of "public datasets" in the deep learning pipeline. However, the specific public datasets used are not identified.

In summary, while the provided context does not give explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that some data was likely collected through surveys or observations, and public datasets may also have been used.
