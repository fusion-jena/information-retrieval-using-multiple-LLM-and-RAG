Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is regression. The model is implemented using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a specific architecture called EfficientNet-B4. The CNN is trained to predict the age of salmon based on scale images. Therefore, the model is designed to regress or estimate a continuous value (the age of the salmon) rather than perform tasks such as classification, segmentation, or object detection. This is evident from the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the model, which include test loss, mean squared error (MSE), mean average percentage error (MAPE), and accuracy. The accuracy is calculated by rounding the prediction to the nearest integer age and comparing it with the ground truth. The ground truth is the label provided by human readers, and the performance metrics directly relate to this. In summary, the CNN model is designed for regression, specifically for predicting the age of salmon based on scale images.
