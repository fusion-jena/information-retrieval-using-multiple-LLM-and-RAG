The provided context discusses the use of the InVEST pollination model and the impact of pixel resolution on the accuracy of the model's output. While this information is related to the field of environmental modeling, it does not directly address the query regarding strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

In general, deep learning pipelines may include sources of randomness such as the random initialization of model weights or the use of random data augmentation techniques. Strategies for handling randomness in deep learning include:

1. **Fixed random seed value:** To ensure reproducibility of results, a fixed random seed value can be set for functions that involve randomness, such as the random initialization of model weights. This ensures that the same random numbers are generated during each run of the model.
2. **Ensemble methods:** Ensemble methods, such as bagging or boosting, can be used to reduce the impact of randomness on model performance. These methods involve training multiple models on different subsets of the data and combining their predictions to produce a final output.
3. **Cross-validation:** Cross-validation can be used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model and reduce the impact of randomness. This involves dividing the data into multiple folds, training the model on one fold and testing it on another, and repeating this process for all possible combinations of folds.
4. **Data augmentation:** Data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, flipping, or cropping, can be used to increase the size of the training dataset and reduce overfitting. These techniques involve creating new synthetic samples by applying random transformations to the existing data.

While the provided context does not discuss these strategies specifically in the context of deep learning, they are commonly used approaches for handling randomness in machine learning pipelines.
