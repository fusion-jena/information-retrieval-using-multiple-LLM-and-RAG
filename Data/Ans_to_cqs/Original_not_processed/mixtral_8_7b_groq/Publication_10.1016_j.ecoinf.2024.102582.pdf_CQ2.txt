The deep learning pipeline used in the study mentioned in the context involves the processing and analysis of remote sensing images, specifically Landsat Surface Reflectance products. Therefore, the primary data format used in this pipeline is image data.

The study utilized the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, which provides a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery, including Landsat data. GEE facilitates rapid data access and parallel processing for image analysis. The researchers used GEE to retrieve atmospherically corrected Landsat Surface Reflectance products for their study area.

Additionally, the study involved the creation of training samples and landscape type extraction. Google Earth Pro was used to randomly generate sample points in the image of the study area for each year. These sample points were then imported into the GEE application programming interface (API) for further analysis. The samples were divided into training and validation datasets, and the random forest algorithm was applied to classify the land use types in the study area.

It is important to note that the study did not mention the use of any other data formats, such as audio, video, or CSV files, in their deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided context, the primary data format used in this study is image data.

Moreover, the study highlighted the limitations of data sources and classification methods, which may affect the understanding of various mangrove species status in China and globally. Future studies could focus on quantifiable policy factors and improved image resolution and machine learning approaches for accurate identification of mangrove species, which could further enhance the deep learning pipeline for mangrove monitoring and evaluation.
