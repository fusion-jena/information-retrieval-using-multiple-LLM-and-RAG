Answer:::

The specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that they applied transfer learning and fine-tuning technique with the ResNet50 model, which was pre-trained on ImageNet data. It can be inferred that they might have used a standard optimization technique that is commonly used in transfer learning, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.

In transfer learning, a pre-trained model is used as a starting point, and the weights of the model are fine-tuned for a new, related task. This approach is useful when there is a limited amount of training data available for the new task. The optimization technique is used to update the weights of the model during training, by minimizing the loss function.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the weights of the model by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight, and then adjusting the weight in the opposite direction of the gradient. SGD is widely used in deep learning due to its simplicity and efficiency.

Adam is another optimization algorithm that is commonly used in deep learning. Adam is an extension of SGD that adaptively adjusts the learning rate for each weight based on the historical gradient information. This can result in faster convergence and better performance compared to SGD.

In summary, while the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that they might have used a standard optimization technique such as SGD or Adam in their transfer learning approach.
