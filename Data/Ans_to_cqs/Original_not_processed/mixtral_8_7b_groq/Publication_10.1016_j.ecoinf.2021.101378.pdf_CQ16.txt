Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the RF and Maxent models used in the study. However, it is mentioned that the dataset was randomly separated into two parts with a ratio of 7:3 for model training and testing, and the accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve values were used to evaluate the performance of each model.

In general, in machine learning, training is often stopped when the performance on a validation set stops improving, or when a plateau in the validation loss is reached. This is a common practice to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on new, unseen data.

In the case of the RF model, it is a boosting algorithm, which means that it builds many decision trees, and each tree is trained to correct the errors made by the previous tree. The training process stops when a certain number of trees is reached, or when the improvement in the model's performance on the validation set is not significant.

In the case of the Maxent model, it is a maximum entropy model, which finds the probability distribution of the target variable that is most consistent with the environmental variables, given the observed data. The training process stops when the model's performance on the validation set stops improving, or when a plateau in the validation loss is reached.

It is important to note that the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete can vary depending on the study and the specific implementation of the models. The context provided does not give enough information to determine the specific criteria used in this study.
