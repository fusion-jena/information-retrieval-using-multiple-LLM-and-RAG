Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context includes various datasets and studies related to species distribution models and habitat suitability, but it does not mention any data repository for a deep learning pipeline.

The context includes two studies by Crego et al. (2022) and DiMiceli et al. (2022) that discuss the implementation of species distribution models and the use of MODIS/Terra Vegetation Continuous Fields data, respectively. However, neither study provides information about a deep learning pipeline or its data repository.

Additionally, there are several studies and papers that discuss the use of machine learning and statistical methods for species distribution modeling, such as Fourcade et al. (2014), Godsoe (2012), Beery et al. (2021), Boria et al. (2014), and Boyce et al. (2002). While these studies discuss the importance of data and model validation, they do not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or its data repository.

Furthermore, the context includes various datasets related to species occurrence, habitat suitability, and environmental variables. However, these datasets are not specifically linked to a deep learning pipeline or its data repository.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not available.
