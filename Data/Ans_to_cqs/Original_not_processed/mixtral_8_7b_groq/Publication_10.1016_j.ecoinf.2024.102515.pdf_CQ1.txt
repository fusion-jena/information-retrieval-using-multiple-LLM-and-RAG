In the context provided, the deep learning pipeline involves using data from tweets to create a model for biodiversity observations. The raw data for this pipeline is collected using the Twitter API, which searches for specific words or hashtags in the text of tweets. This is similar to the Twitter Advanced Search interface, where users can search for tweets based on specific criteria.

To collect the raw data for this study, the researchers used three different queries to search for tweets. These queries were designed to capture tweets where users had found something interesting and were asking for help identifying it. The queries were: (i) tweets where users ask “who knows” or if “anyone knows” what they have found, (ii) tweets that directly ask “what is this” that they have found, and (iii) tweets from users claiming to have found something, with textual expression as “I/we have found”. Different verb tenses and singular and plural forms of the words were also used in each of the expressions.

To handle the data in JSON format returned by the Twitter API, the researchers used the twarc2 library, which simplifies the handling of the quota limits imposed by the Twitter API and the pagination resulting from a single query.

It is important to note that the raw data collected from tweets has some limitations. The main limitation is that tweets have a low number of words accompanying the messages, which are not always well written. This makes it difficult to obtain useful information and leads to a high number of tweets being lost in the filtering process. Additionally, using only textual information from tweets to obtain a training dataset would only lead to the creation of a deficient model. Biodiversity observations only make sense when accompanied by their location, which allows for applications such as alerting about the presence of invasive species or reusing the information in species distribution.

Therefore, while the raw data for this deep learning pipeline is collected using the Twitter API and specific queries, it is important to keep in mind the limitations of this data and the importance of accompanying biodiversity observations with their location.
