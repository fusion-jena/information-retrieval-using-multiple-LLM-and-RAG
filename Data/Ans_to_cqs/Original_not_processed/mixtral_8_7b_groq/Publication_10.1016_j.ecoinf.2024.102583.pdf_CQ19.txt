The text provided does not give specific information about the deep learning models used in the landslide susceptibility modeling (LSM) research. However, it does mention the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) in a broader investigation.

To build these deep learning models, researchers often use popular frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. TensorFlow, developed by Google Brain, is a powerful open-source library for machine learning and artificial intelligence projects. It offers flexibility, scalability, and compatibility with various operating systems. PyTorch, developed by Facebook's AI Research lab, is another widely-used open-source machine learning library known for its simplicity and ease of use, particularly for building and training neural networks.

While the text does not explicitly mention TensorFlow or PyTorch, these frameworks are the go-to choices for most researchers working with CNNs and RCNNs. Therefore, it is highly likely that these frameworks were used in the LSM research involving deep learning models. However, without explicit confirmation in the text, this answer is based on common practices in the field of deep learning research.
