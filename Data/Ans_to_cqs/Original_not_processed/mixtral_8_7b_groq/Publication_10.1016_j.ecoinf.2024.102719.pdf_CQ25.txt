Based on the provided context, the specific purpose of the deep learning model used in the study by Zamri et al. (2023) is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is employed for river quality assessment, as part of a larger group of machine learning models.

The study compares the performance of eleven machine learning models, including the multilayer perceptron (MLP), which is a type of deep learning model, in predicting river health. The models were utilized to identify potential causes of impairment in areas of ecological concern, supporting strategic decisions on prioritizing restoration activities and new monitoring initiatives. The deep learning model, along with the other models, was evaluated based on its generalizability to unseen datasets, which is crucial for predicting river health in unmonitored areas.

The context does not mention any specific application of the deep learning model, such as classification, segmentation, or detection. Nonetheless, given that the models were used for predicting river health, it can be assumed that the deep learning model was used for predictive tasks, possibly involving regression or classification of environmental factors affecting river health.

In summary, while the specific purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that the model was used for predicting river health, contributing to the generalizability of the predictive models in the study by Zamri et al. (2023).
