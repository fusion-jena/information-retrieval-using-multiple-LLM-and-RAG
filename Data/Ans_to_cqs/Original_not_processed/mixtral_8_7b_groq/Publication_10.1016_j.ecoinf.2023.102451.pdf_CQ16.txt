Based on the provided context, the training of the proposed model EMViT-Net is completed after 100 epochs. However, the specific criterion used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the training process might be using a validation loss plateau or a similar concept as a stopping criterion.

In the context, it is mentioned that the loss and accuracy curves of the reported network are given in Fig. 5. This suggests that the validation loss and accuracy were being monitored during the training process. The use of such curves is common in machine learning to check the performance of the model and to prevent overfitting. If the validation loss starts to increase or plateaus after a certain number of epochs, it might indicate that the model is overfitting to the training data, and the training process can be stopped.

Furthermore, the context mentions that the EMViT-Net framework achieves prominent results as compared to other deep learning models and performs better with an augmented set of EMDS-6 datasets. This suggests that the model was trained until it achieved satisfactory performance on the validation set.

Therefore, while the exact criterion used to determine when training is complete is not specified, it can be inferred that the training process might be using a validation loss plateau or a similar concept as a stopping criterion.
