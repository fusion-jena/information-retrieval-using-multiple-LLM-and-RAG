Answer:::

The context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Meticulous manual tuning of hyperparameters was conducted, and the selected hyperparameters that yielded the best performance metrics are presented in Table 1. However, the text does not mention whether methods such as grid search, random search, or other optimization techniques were used. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given context.
