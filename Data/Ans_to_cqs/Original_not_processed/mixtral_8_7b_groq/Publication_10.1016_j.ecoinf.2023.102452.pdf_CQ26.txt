Answer: The provided context discusses various aspects of data-driven modeling (DDM) and machine learning techniques, but it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some relevant concepts that can be applied to address data bias.

One common technique to address data bias is through diverse data collection. This involves gathering data from multiple sources or under different conditions to ensure that the data is representative of the population. For instance, in the context of streamflow forecasting, collecting data from various river basins or under different climate conditions can help ensure that the model is not biased towards a particular region or climate.

Another technique to address data bias is through stratified splitting. This involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain criteria (such as class labels) and then randomly sampling from each subgroup. This ensures that each subgroup is proportionally represented in the training, validation, and test sets.

Additionally, oversampling and undersampling techniques can be used to address data bias. Oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class to balance the dataset, while undersampling involves removing samples from the majority class. These techniques can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of genetic programming for system identification of rainfall-runoff models. Genetic programming is a type of evolutionary algorithm that can be used to optimize the inputs and parameters of a model. This can help ensure that the model is not biased towards certain inputs or parameters.

Finally, the context also discusses the use of entropy maximization for restoring and analyzing signals. Entropy maximization is a technique used to ensure that the model is not biased towards certain frequencies or patterns in the data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it does mention relevant concepts such as diverse data collection, stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, genetic programming, and entropy maximization that can be applied to address data bias.
