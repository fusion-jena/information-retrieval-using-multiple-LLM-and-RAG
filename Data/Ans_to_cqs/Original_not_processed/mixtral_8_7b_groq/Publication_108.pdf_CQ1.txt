Answer:::
The context provided does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study used high-resolution orthophotos with 20-cm spatial resolution obtained from an aerial survey. Therefore, we can infer that aerial surveys were used to collect the raw data in this specific case. Other methods such as sensors, public datasets, or surveys could potentially be used for collecting raw data in other deep learning pipelines, but the context does not provide enough information to make a general statement.
