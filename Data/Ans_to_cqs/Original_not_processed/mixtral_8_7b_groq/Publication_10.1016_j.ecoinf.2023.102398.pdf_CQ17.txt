Answer:::

The context provided discusses various aspects of deep learning model training, including the use of mean square error (MSE) for optimal training state determination and graded MSE convergence to fine-tune the model, but it does not explicitly mention specific regularization methods like dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning best practices, it is common to use regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, preventing over-dependence on any single neuron and thus reducing overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages smaller weights, making the model more general and less prone to overfitting.

Therefore, while not explicitly stated in the provided context, it is reasonable to assume that regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization were used in the deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting.
