Based on the provided context, the text does not discuss the specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text focuses on an Open Science workflow that combines vessel tracking data from satellite and AIS systems with global, high-quality, environmental, biodiversity, and fishery data to estimate fishing pressure on stocks and other species.

The workflow involves associating information on stocks, species variety, and threatening status to the fishing hours of each cell in the studied area. This is achieved through a direct query to the SPARQL endpoint of the GRSF semantic knowledge base. The algorithm then calculates the fishing pressure per stock as the number of fishing hours per cell where the stock occurs.

The text mentions that the workflow can be used by other systems to extend current vessel activity classification processes, identify bycatch species, and study the effects of fisheries on habitats and populationsâ€™ growth. However, it does not provide details on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not discuss the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
