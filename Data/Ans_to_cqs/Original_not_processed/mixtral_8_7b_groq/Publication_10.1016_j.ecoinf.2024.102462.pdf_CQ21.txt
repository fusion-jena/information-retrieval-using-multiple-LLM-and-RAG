After training a deep learning (DL) model, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken to evaluate and interpret the model's performance. Some common postprocessing steps include:

1. **Generating confusion matrices:** A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It compares the predicted classifications made by the model to the true classifications, and can provide insights into the types of errors that the model is making. In the given context, confusion matrices are used to present the classification results for both the training sets and the observer study.
2. **Calculating metrics:** There are various metrics that can be calculated from the confusion matrix, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics can provide a more quantitative evaluation of the model's performance, and can be useful for comparing the performance of different models.
3. **Visualizing saliency maps:** A saliency map is a visualization technique that can be used to highlight the regions of an input image that are most important for the model's classification decision. This can be useful for understanding which features of the input data the model is paying attention to, and can provide insights into the model's decision-making process.

In the given context, there is no mention of saliency maps being used as a postprocessing step. However, the use of confusion matrices and metrics calculation are mentioned.

It's worth noting that the postprocessing steps described above are typically performed on a separate "testing" dataset, which is not used during the training process. This allows for an independent evaluation of the model's performance on new, unseen data.
