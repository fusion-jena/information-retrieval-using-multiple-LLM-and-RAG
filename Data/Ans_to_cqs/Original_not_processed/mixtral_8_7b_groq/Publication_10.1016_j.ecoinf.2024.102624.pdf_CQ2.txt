Answer:::
The article does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the keywords and the descriptions provided, it can be inferred that the data used in this study is related to image classification. The input data includes spectral bands (green, red, red edge, NIR), spectral indices (NDVI, vNDVI, NDRE), a texture index (Run Percentage), and a Digital Surface Model (DSM). These are all types of image data that are commonly used in remote sensing and geospatial analysis. It is likely that these image data were used in a format such as GeoTIFF or similar raster format. Therefore, the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline is likely to be image data in the form of raster files. The other techniques mentioned in the article, such as Recursive Feature Elimination, training data augmentation, and post-classification, are all methods applied to image data or the results of image classification. Hence, the data formats used in this deep learning pipeline are primarily image-based formats, such as GeoTIFF or other raster formats.
