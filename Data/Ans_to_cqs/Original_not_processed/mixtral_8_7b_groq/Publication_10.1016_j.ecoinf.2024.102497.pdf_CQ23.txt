Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the generalizability measures taken for a deep learning model. However, there are details about the implementation of a CART (Classification and Regression Tree) model and a Random Forest Regression (RFR) method for bathymetry retrieval. 

For the CART model, specific model parameters were fine-tuned to prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation error. These parameters include 'max_depth', 'min_samples_leaf', and 'max_leaf_nodes', which were set to 8, 5, and 20, respectively. This suggests that cross-validation was employed to assess the model's performance and avoid overfitting, thereby enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen data.

As for the RFR model, multiple experiments and comparisons were conducted to determine the optimal parameters for achieving optimal prediction results and enhancing nearshore bathymetry accuracy. However, there is no explicit mention of cross-validation or other measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the RFR model.

In conclusion, while there is evidence of cross-validation being used to tune the CART model's parameters, there is no explicit information about other generalizability measures such as diverse dataset collection, stratified splitting, or regularization techniques for either the CART or RFR models. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query based on the given context.
