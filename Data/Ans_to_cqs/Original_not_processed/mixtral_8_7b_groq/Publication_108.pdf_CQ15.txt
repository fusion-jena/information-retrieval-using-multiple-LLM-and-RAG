Answer:::

The optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, are the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Adam.

The Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is a widely used optimization algorithm for non-linear least squares problems, which is used to train neural networks by minimizing the difference between the predicted and actual values. This algorithm is implemented in the deep learning pipeline for optimization, as mentioned in More, J.J. (1978).

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular optimization algorithm used in deep learning for training neural networks. It works by iteratively adjusting the weights and biases in the direction that minimally reduces the loss function. Although SGD is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is the default optimization algorithm in many deep learning libraries, and its use can be inferred.

Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is a more recent optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of both SGD and the Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad). Adam was developed by Kingma, D.P., and Ba, J. (2015) and is known for its efficiency and adaptability in handling large datasets and high-dimensional parameter spaces. In the context provided, Adam is used as the optimization technique for training a deep learning model for forest damage assessment.

In summary, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Adam are the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context.
