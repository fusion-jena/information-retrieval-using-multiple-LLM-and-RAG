Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context mainly focuses on comparing the performance of different classification networks in categorizing objects of different sizes, specifically "medium" and "small" objects.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to split the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

In the context, Table 3 presents the classification accuracy for both "medium" and "small" objects across different networks. It is possible that the data was split based on object size, with an equal number of "medium" and "small" objects in each subset. However, this is only speculation, as the context does not provide enough information to determine the data splitting criteria.
