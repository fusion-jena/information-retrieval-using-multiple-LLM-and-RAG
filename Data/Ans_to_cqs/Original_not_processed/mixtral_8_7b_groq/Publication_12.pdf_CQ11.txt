Answer:::
The provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The study describes the development of a model called BatNet for automatic standardized processing and identification of tropical bat calls using deep learning approaches. However, there is no mention of a data repository link for the pipeline such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The study does provide references to other studies that have used data repositories, but it does not provide a link for its own data.
