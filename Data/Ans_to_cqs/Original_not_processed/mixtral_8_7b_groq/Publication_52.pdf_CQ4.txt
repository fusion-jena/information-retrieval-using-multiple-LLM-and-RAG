Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the described deep learning pipelines. The context focuses on the use of Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) and a specific autoencoder algorithm called GRELMA for clustering.

ELMs are a type of feedforward neural network that can handle big data analysis and have the potential to generalize performance based on training data. The GRELMA algorithm is an unsupervised learning approach used for clustering, and it is used as a basic building block in a multi-layered neural network model.

While data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size and diversity of training data, the specific techniques mentioned in the query are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given information.
