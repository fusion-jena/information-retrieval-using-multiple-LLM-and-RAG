Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about how the data is split for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context focuses on the hybrid MCMC algorithm, genetic algorithm, and least squares procedure for estimating parameters in a model.

However, we can infer some general criteria for data splitting that might be used in this context. In machine learning and model training, it is common to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model performance.

In the context provided, the genetic algorithm is used to generate a set of best-fitting parameters by iteratively improving upon initial values. The rows of the database are ordered according to the sum of the residual values, and the first quarter of the best fit parameter values are considered as input for the next iteration. This process could be seen as a form of data splitting, where the top-performing models (i.e., those with the lowest sum of residual values) are used to generate new initial values for the next iteration.

Furthermore, the hybrid MCMC algorithm provides a series of independent chains containing a trace of values for each parameter to estimate. These traces are stored in text files and can be further analyzed to obtain the final parameter values, their distribution, and their associated uncertainty. This process could be seen as a form of validation, where the multiple chains are used to assess the robustness and reliability of the estimated parameter values.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, we can infer some general principles based on common practices in machine learning and model training. The genetic algorithm and hybrid MCMC algorithm could be seen as forms of data splitting and validation, where the top-performing models are used to generate new initial values or assess the reliability of estimated parameter values. However, without further information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to this query.
