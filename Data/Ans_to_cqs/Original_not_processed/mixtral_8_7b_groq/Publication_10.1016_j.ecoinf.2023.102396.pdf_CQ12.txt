Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated which type of deep learning model, such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer, is used in the pipeline. However, the context does mention the use of Gompertz population models and dynamic time warping for feature extractions and hierarchical clustering for classifications of animal population time series. These techniques are commonly used in time series analysis and machine learning, but they do not fall under the category of deep learning models.

It is possible that the authors used a deep learning model in conjunction with these techniques, but the context does not provide enough information to determine that. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
