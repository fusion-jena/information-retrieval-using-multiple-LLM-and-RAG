Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the structure of a convolutional neural network (CNN) used for sound classification, including details about the number of filters, kernel size, fully connected layer, and softmax layer. It also mentions that data augmentation was used and that the samples were split into training and testing sets. However, there is no information about where the data can be found or accessed. Therefore, I cannot provide a data repository link based on the given context.
