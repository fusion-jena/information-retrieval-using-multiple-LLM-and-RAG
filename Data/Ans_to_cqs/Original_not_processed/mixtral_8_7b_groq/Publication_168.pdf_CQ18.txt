Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it is mentioned that the UAV hyperspectral image is split into a training set and a test set with a ratio of 1:9. The training samples were used to learn the weights and biases of the SSPCNN model, while the test samples were used to evaluate the classification performance. This suggests that the model's performance was likely monitored by evaluating the classification accuracy on the test set after each epoch or after a certain number of epochs during the training process. Additionally, the use of kappa coefficient as a performance measure also implies that the consistency of the classification results was taken into account when evaluating the model's performance.

It is also worth noting that the SSPCNN model is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) which is a powerful deep learning model that is well-suited for image classification tasks. CNN models typically include mechanisms for monitoring model performance during training, such as validation sets and early stopping. A validation set is a subset of the training data that is used to evaluate the model's performance during training. Early stopping is a technique that stops the training process when the model's performance on the validation set stops improving, which helps to prevent overfitting. However, the context does not provide specific information about whether these techniques were used in this case.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information about the strategy used to monitor the model's performance during training, it can be inferred that the model's performance was likely evaluated on a test set after each epoch or after a certain number of epochs. Additionally, the use of kappa coefficient as a performance measure suggests that the consistency of the classification results was taken into account. However, specific information about the use of validation sets and early stopping is not provided.
