Answer:::

The pieces of context provided do not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for seagrass identification and mapping. However, they do mention several datasets and studies that have been used for developing and testing deep learning models for this purpose.

One of the datasets mentioned is the 'LookingForSeagrass' dataset (Neuderth, 2018), which was used to compare the performance of several deep learning models for seagrass coverage estimation. The dataset likely consists of underwater images or videos, but the specific method of data collection is not mentioned.

In the study by Martin-Abadal et al. (2018), an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) was used to collect data for deep semantic segmentation of Posidonia oceanica meadows. This suggests that AUVs or other underwater vehicles may be used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for seagrass identification.

The study by Wang et al. (2020a) used satellite images from the 'WorldView-2' satellite for seagrass coverage estimation. This indicates that satellite imagery is another source of raw data that can be used in the deep learning pipeline for seagrass mapping.

Additionally, the study by Perez et al. (2020) used 'WorldView-2' satellite images at three different coastal locations in Florida for seagrass distribution mapping. They compared the performance of a deep capsule network (DCN) and a deep CNN model, which suggests that both satellite imagery and underwater images or videos can be used as raw data sources for deep learning models.

In summary, while the pieces of context do not provide explicit details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for seagrass identification and mapping, they do suggest that underwater vehicles, satellite imagery, and possibly other sources of data may be used. Further investigation would be needed to determine the specific methods used in each study or dataset.
