Answer:::

The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the given context is an acceptable Root Mean Square (RMS) value. The "Acceptable RMS" value is set to 0.01 in the first table (MLP parameters and performance), which is a measure of the difference between the predicted and actual values. Once the RMS value reaches or falls below this threshold during the training process, the training is considered complete. This is a common practice in machine learning and neural network training, where the training process continues until the model's performance, as measured by the RMS or other metrics, meets a predefined standard.
