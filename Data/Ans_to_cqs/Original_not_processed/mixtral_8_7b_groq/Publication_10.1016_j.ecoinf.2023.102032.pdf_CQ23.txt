Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some implicit indications that suggest some steps were taken towards this goal.

Firstly, the study used the Sentinel-2 satellite's data, which provides high-resolution images of the Earth's surface. This could imply that the dataset used for training the model is diverse, covering different land use classes in the study area. However, this is not explicitly stated in the text.

Secondly, the study presents an overview of the plot locations in Figure 4. This figure shows the geographical distribution of the plots used in the study, which might suggest that some form of stratified splitting was applied to ensure that the model is trained on a representative sample of the study area.

Lastly, the study mentions that the results of the model were validated using a confusion matrix and overall accuracy. While this does not directly relate to the generalizability of the model, it does indicate that some form of validation was performed to assess the model's performance.

In conclusion, while the text does not provide explicit information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, there are some implicit indications that suggest that steps were taken towards this goal, such as using diverse satellite data, presenting an overview of the plot locations, and validating the model's performance. However, without more information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
