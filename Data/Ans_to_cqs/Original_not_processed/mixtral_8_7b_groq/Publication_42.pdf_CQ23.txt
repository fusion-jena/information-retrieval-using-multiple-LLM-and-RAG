Answer:::
The text provided does not give a detailed description of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that different hyperparameters were adjusted to find the best CNN architecture for species classification, and the average F1-score for all classes was used as a measure for a given architecture's performance. This suggests that the performance of the model was evaluated across all classes, rather than just on the majority class, which can help to ensure that the model is able to generalize well to all classes in the dataset. Additionally, the use of a dropout probability of 0.3 after the second to last hidden layer may have helped to reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. However, without more information, it is difficult to say for certain what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.

It is also worth noting that the text mentions that a very high F1-score of 96.6% was achieved through transfer learning on ResNetV50 using pretrained weights and only training the output layers. Transfer learning is a technique that can help to improve the generalizability of a deep learning model by using pretrained weights that have been trained on a large and diverse dataset. By using pretrained weights, the model can learn features that are relevant to a wide range of images, rather than just the images in the species classification dataset. This can help to improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

In summary, while the text does not provide a detailed description of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it does suggest that the model was evaluated across all classes and that transfer learning was used to improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.
