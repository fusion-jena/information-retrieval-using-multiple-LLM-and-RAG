Based on the provided context, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are raster data formats. Raster data is a grid of cells, where each cell holds a value representing information such as land use, temperature, or elevation.

In the context, raster data is used to represent land use and land expansion. Specifically, land type expansion raster and driver raster map are used. The land type expansion raster is added to the Land Expansion Analysis System (LEAS), while the driver raster map is used in the Random Forest Classifier (RFC) to obtain the probability of development and the contribution of drivers for each land category.

Additionally, the raster data is likely processed and analyzed in a raster geographic information system (GIS) format, which is a type of software that is used to view, analyze, and manage spatial data.

It is important to note that the specific raster data format is not specified in the context. Common raster data formats include GeoTIFF, ESRI Grid, and IMG. These formats can store multiband data, which is useful for analyzing multivariate time series data, as mentioned in the context.

In summary, the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context are raster data formats, which are used to represent land use and land expansion in a raster GIS format.
