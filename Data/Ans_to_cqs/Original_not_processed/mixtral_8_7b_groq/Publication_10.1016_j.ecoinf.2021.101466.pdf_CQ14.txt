Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. It is possible that the authors used techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization, but this information is not explicitly stated.

In the context, it is mentioned that the performance of the EfficientNet model was improved by applying random erasing to the training dataset. This suggests that some form of hyperparameter tuning was performed, as the decision to apply random erasing is a hyperparameter decision. However, the specific method used to make this decision is not provided.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of the YOLOv4 model for object detection, which is a pre-trained model with fixed hyperparameters. Therefore, it is unlikely that hyperparameter optimization was performed on the YOLOv4 model itself.

In summary, while it is possible that hyperparameter optimization was performed on the models used in the study, the specific methods used are not provided in the given context.
