Answer:::

The specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it does mention that TensorFlow, an open-source library for machine learning, is used. TensorFlow includes several optimization algorithms, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, and Adam.

The context does provide information about some of the parameters that were optimized, including the learning rate (μ) and momentum (β). These are parameters that are commonly adjusted in optimization algorithms to improve convergence and model performance. The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration, while momentum introduces a moving average of past gradients to smooth the optimization process.

The search intervals for these parameters suggest that a systematic approach was used to find the optimal values. The learning rate was searched within the interval [0.05, 0.25], and the momentum was searched within the interval [0,1]. The optimization algorithm would have used these intervals to search for the best values of these parameters during the training process.

In addition, the context mentions that the optimization run consisted of 3000 train iterations with a batch size of 25 individuals, and validation was performed every 300 iterations. This information suggests that some form of early stopping or learning rate scheduling may have been used to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

Overall, while the specific optimization technique is not mentioned, the context provides information about the optimization parameters and the training procedure, which suggest that a systematic and effective optimization approach was used in the deep learning pipeline.
