Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions various studies and methods used for training and scaling Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for pest detection and identification, but it does not specify where the data or code for the pipeline is stored or hosted. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to the query.
