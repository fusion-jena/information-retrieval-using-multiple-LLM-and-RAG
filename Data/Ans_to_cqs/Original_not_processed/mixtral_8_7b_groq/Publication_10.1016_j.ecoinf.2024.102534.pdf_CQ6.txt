Based on the provided context, there are no specific mentions of deep learning model preprocessing steps. However, some of the mentioned responsibilities of the authors can be associated with typical preprocessing steps in machine learning projects, which can also apply to deep learning.

Preprocessing steps for deep learning models usually include:

1. Data curation: This step involves cleaning and transforming raw data into an understandable format. In the provided context, multiple authors have Data Curation as one of their responsibilities, which can include handling missing values, outliers, or incorrect data entries.

2. Normalization and Scaling: These techniques are applied to adjust the range of features, so the model can learn effectively. In the provided context, there are no explicit mentions of authors responsible for normalization or scaling, but it can be a part of the data curation process.

3. Feature Engineering: This step includes creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance. Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, some authors have Conceptualization and Methodology responsibilities, which can include feature engineering.

4. Validation: This step involves splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. Joko Ridho Witono, Lina Susanti Juswara, Izu Andry Fijridiyanto, Siti Roosita Ariati, Inggit Puji Astuti, Dwi Murti Puspitaningtyas, and Aninda Retno Utami Wibowo have Validation as one of their responsibilities, which can be associated with splitting the dataset.

5. Supervision: This responsibility includes overseeing the overall process and ensuring the quality of the work. Authors such as Hary Wawangningrum, Joko Ridho Witono, Lina Susanti Juswara, Izu Andry Fijridiyanto, Siti Roosita Ariati, Irvan Fadli Wanda, Inggit Puji Astuti, Dwi Murti Puspitaningtyas, and Aninda Retno Utami Wibowo have Supervision as one of their responsibilities, which can include supervising preprocessing steps.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention deep learning preprocessing steps, several responsibilities of the authors can be associated with typical preprocessing steps, such as data curation, validation, and supervision.
