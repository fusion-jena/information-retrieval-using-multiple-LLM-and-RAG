Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in the analysis of complex data, but it does not explicitly mention any optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.

SOMs are a type of artificial neural network used for unsupervised clustering and visualization of high-dimensional data. The learning rate in SOMs decreases over time, and the number of categories significantly affects the clustering results. However, the context does not mention any optimization techniques used in the training of SOMs.

SVMs, on the other hand, are a type of supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis. The context mentions that the training efficiency of SVMs for large sample datasets is not ideal and that further optimization of the training algorithm is necessary. However, it does not specify which optimization techniques are used.

Deep learning pipelines typically use optimization techniques such as SGD, Adam, or RMSprop to minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance. These optimization techniques use different approaches to update the model's weights, such as adaptive learning rates, momentum, or Nesterov accelerated gradient.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is important to note that optimization techniques are crucial in deep learning to improve the model's performance and convergence.
