Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for predicting the diving locations of birds monitored with only GPS devices. However, it is mentioned that the authors constructed the deep learning models in R using H2O, which is a machine learning platform that provides various data pre-processing capabilities, including data augmentation.

Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize to new data. These techniques work by creating new synthetic samples by applying random transformations to the existing data.

For instance, in the context of image data, flipping refers to horizontally or vertically flipping the image, rotating refers to rotating the image by a certain angle, and scaling refers to changing the size of the image. Similarly, in the context of time-series data, such as the GPS track data used in the study, data augmentation techniques could include time-warping, jittering, or adding noise to the data.

Therefore, while the specific data augmentation techniques used in the study are not mentioned, it is likely that the authors used some form of data augmentation to improve the performance of their deep learning models. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
