The pieces of context provided do not directly mention the regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, they do discuss regularization in the context of regression techniques and machine learning models.

Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in models by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large parameter values and promotes simpler models. In Support Vector Regression (SVR), one of the mentioned regression techniques, regularization is applied using the C regularization parameter in the kernel function. This parameter controls the trade-off between fitting the data well and keeping the model simple.

In the context of deep learning, dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used methods to prevent overfitting. Dropout is a regularization technique specifically designed for neural networks. During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction of the neuron outputs to zero, effectively preventing over-reliance on any single neuron and promoting the learning of more robust features. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the model parameters to the loss function, encouraging smaller parameter values and simpler models.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention dropout or L2 regularization, it does discuss regularization in the context of machine learning models. Dropout and L2 regularization are widely used regularization techniques in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Dropout is specifically designed for neural networks, and L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to encourage smaller parameter values.
