Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data used in the discussed study involves images of different classes of plants. These images could have been collected through various methods such as:

1. Surveys: Researchers could have conducted surveys in various geographical locations to collect images of different plant species.

2. Sensors: Images could have been collected using sensors like drones or satellites equipped with cameras to capture images of plants in their natural habitats.

3. Public datasets: Researchers might have used publicly available datasets containing images of various plant species.

4. Manual collection: Researchers could have manually collected images of plants by visiting different locations and capturing images using cameras.

In the context, it is mentioned that the data is divided into five equal folds, and automatic data augmentation methods are used to artificially increase and diversify the training data. This suggests that the raw data collected through any of the above methods is then processed and augmented using data augmentation techniques to improve the generalization ability of the deep learning model.
