Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the studies. The context includes details about various research studies related to image analysis and classification of objects in images, particularly mangrove trees and urban areas. However, none of the studies mention or provide a link to the code repository for their deep learning pipelines. It is possible that the authors have not made the code publicly available, or it may not be hosted on popular platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. If the code repository becomes available in the future, it would be helpful for reproducibility and further development of the research.
