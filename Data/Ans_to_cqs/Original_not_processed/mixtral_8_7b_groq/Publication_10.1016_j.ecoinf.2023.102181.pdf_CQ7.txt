Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as creating separate sets for training, testing, and validation, are not specified in the provided context. The text mainly discusses the use of cross-validation, particularly with bagging, as a method for validating model predictions. Cross-validation involves partitioning the data into subsets, or "folds," and setting aside a portion of the sample data during model training to test the accuracy of the model predictions.

In the context of bagging, the data are split into subsets to create bootstrap samples, which are used to train multiple models. These models are then aggregated to form an ensemble predictor. However, this process does not necessarily involve a separate test or validation set in the same way that traditional data splitting methods do.

It is important to note that the provided context focuses on the use of covariance-weighted bagging as a way to minimize biased training of machine learning models with clustered data. This technique aims to reduce bias during model training by down-weighting over-sampled information.

In summary, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The text primarily discusses cross-validation and covariance-weighted bagging as methods for validating model predictions and minimizing biased training, respectively.
