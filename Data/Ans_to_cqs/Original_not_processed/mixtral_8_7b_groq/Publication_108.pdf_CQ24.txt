Answer:::

The provided context does not directly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does discuss the use of various hyperparameters, which can indirectly influence the randomness and variability of the training process.

In the context provided, the authors experimented with different hyperparameters, such as the number of blocks and filters, learning rate, and initialization methods, to find an optimal setting for their problem. These hyperparameters can affect the randomness of the training process by influencing the weights and biases of the neural network.

For example, the learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. A smaller learning rate may result in a more stable and consistent training process, but it may also require more epochs to converge to the optimal solution. On the other hand, a larger learning rate may result in a more variable and unstable training process, but it may also converge more quickly to the optimal solution.

Initialization methods can also affect the randomness of the training process. The context mentions the use of the Adam optimization algorithm, which uses adaptive learning rates for each parameter. The Adam algorithm can help reduce the randomness and variability of the training process by adapting the learning rate to the properties of the gradient at each iteration.

The context also mentions the use of rectified linear units (ReLUs), which can help reduce the vanishing gradient problem and improve the training process. ReLUs introduce non-linearity to the neural network and can help the network learn more complex patterns in the data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does discuss the use of hyperparameters that can indirectly influence the randomness and variability of the training process. Strategies for handling randomness may include the use of a random seed value, as well as careful selection and tuning of hyperparameters such as the learning rate and initialization methods.
