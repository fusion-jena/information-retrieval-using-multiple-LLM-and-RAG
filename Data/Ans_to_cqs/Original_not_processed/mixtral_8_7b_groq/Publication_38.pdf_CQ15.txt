Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning for bat acoustic signal detection, but it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the references provided, it can be inferred that some common optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam might have been used.

For instance, the paper "Deep neural networks for acoustic modeling in speech recognition: The shared views of four research groups" (reference 37) provides a comprehensive overview of deep neural networks for speech recognition, which is a field closely related to signal processing and classification, the tasks performed in the bat acoustic signal detection. This paper mentions SGD as one of the optimization techniques used in deep learning.

Moreover, the paper "Deep convolutional neural networks and data augmentation for environmental sound classification" (reference 35) uses the Adam optimizer for training their deep convolutional neural network for environmental sound classification. Although this paper does not deal with bat acoustic signals specifically, it shows the use of the Adam optimizer in a deep learning pipeline for signal processing and classification tasks.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for bat acoustic signal detection, it can be inferred that SGD and Adam are possible optimization techniques that might have been used based on the related literature.
