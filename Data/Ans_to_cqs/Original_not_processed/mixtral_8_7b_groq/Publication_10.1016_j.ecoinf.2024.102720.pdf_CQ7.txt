Based on the provided context, there is no specific information given about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context mainly discusses the fitness of the SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) model and the drivers of per capita CEFs (Comprehensive Environmental Factors) in Liaoning Province.

However, it is worth noting that in general, when developing a deep learning model, it is common practice to split the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

The criteria for splitting the data can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset. Some common methods include:

1. Random sampling: where the data is randomly divided into the three subsets.
2. Time-series split: where the data is split based on time, with the training set containing earlier data, the validation set containing more recent data, and the testing set containing the most recent data.
3. Stratified sampling: where the data is divided based on specific criteria, such as class balance in a classification problem.

In the context of the provided information, it is not possible to determine the specific criteria used for splitting the data for the deep learning model.
