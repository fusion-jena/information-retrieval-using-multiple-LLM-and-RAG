Answer:::
I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. The context discusses various models such as XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and neural networks, but it does not specify the exact hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. Hyperparameters for deep learning models often include learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, and regularization parameters. However, these details are not provided in the context.
