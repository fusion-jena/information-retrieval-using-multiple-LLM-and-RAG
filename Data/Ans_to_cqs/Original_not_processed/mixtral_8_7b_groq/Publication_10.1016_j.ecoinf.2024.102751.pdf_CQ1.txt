The provided context does not directly discuss the deep learning pipeline or the methods used for collecting raw data in such a pipeline. However, it does mention the use of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, PlanetScope imagery, and Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) in a study related to soil moisture assessment in reclaimed mining areas.

Airborne laser scanning (ALS) is a remote sensing method that uses laser technology to measure the distance between the sensor and the ground, creating a high-resolution topographic dataset. This method is often used for generating digital elevation models (DEMs) and can be used to extract features such as slope, aspect, and TWI.

PlanetScope imagery refers to a type of satellite imagery provided by the company Planet Labs. These images have a high temporal resolution, making them useful for monitoring changes in land cover and vegetation over time. The images can also provide spectral information related to vegetation and water content.

The Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) is a topographic index used to estimate the wetness of a given area based on its slope and upslope contributing area. TWI can be calculated using topographic data, such as ALS data, and can provide information about the potential for water accumulation in a given area.

In summary, the provided context mentions the use of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, PlanetScope imagery, and Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) in a study related to soil moisture assessment in reclaimed mining areas. These methods can be used to collect raw data for a deep learning pipeline focused on soil moisture assessment or related applications. However, the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of the deep learning pipeline or the range of methods used for collecting raw data in such a pipeline.
