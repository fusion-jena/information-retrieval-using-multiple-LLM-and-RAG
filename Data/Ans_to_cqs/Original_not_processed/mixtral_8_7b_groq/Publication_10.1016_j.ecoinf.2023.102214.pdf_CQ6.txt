Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are several preprocessing steps mentioned that are involved before training a deep learning model for image classification, specifically for detecting and identifying individual snow leopards. 

Firstly, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, width and height shifts, and left-right mirroring are used. These techniques help in increasing the amount of training data, reducing overfitting, and improving the model's ability to generalize. 

Secondly, the snow leopard training pipeline involves cleaning the data by removing any irrelevant or noisy information. This step is crucial as a lack of data is the greatest challenge and limitation researchers encounter in data studies. 

Thirdly, the authors mention contributing the largest fully labeled snow leopard dataset for deep learning research, indicating that labeling or annotating the data is an essential preprocessing step. Annotating the data involves identifying and labeling the individual snow leopards in the images, which is a challenging task due to the similar appearance of these animals. 

Lastly, the authors use top-k accuracy as a metric to assess the efficacy of their techniques. However, the context does not explicitly mention any normalization or scaling techniques. Therefore, it is unclear whether these steps are part of the preprocessing pipeline. 

In summary, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model for snow leopard detection and identification include data augmentation, cleaning, and annotating the data. However, it is unclear whether normalization or scaling techniques are used in this pipeline.
