The provided context does not directly discuss the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of remote sensing data, particularly satellite images and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images, in the creation of fire risk maps.

In the context of remote sensing, the relevant data format would be raster images. Satellite and UAV sensors capture reflected electromagnetic radiation in various bands, which are then processed into multispectral or hyperspectral images. Each pixel in these images represents a measurement of the reflected radiation in different bands, which can be used as input to a deep learning model.

For instance, the Landsat 8 satellite generates images with specific bands and spatial resolutions, as shown in Table 1. These images can be used in a deep learning pipeline to predict fire hazard areas or identify burned areas.

Additionally, the context also mentions the use of machine learning techniques like XGBoost and Random Forest, which can be incorporated into a deep learning pipeline. These techniques typically use tabular data (CSV format) as input, where each row represents a sample and each column represents a feature. In the context of remote sensing, these features would be the pixel values from the raster images.

In summary, the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline, in the context of remote sensing for fire risk maps, would be raster images for satellite or UAV data and tabular data (CSV format) for machine learning techniques.
