Answer:::
In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does discuss the importance of preprocessing in the context of face recognition and individual BR ray recognition. Specifically, it highlights the advantage of preprocessing the input instead of relying on data augmentation for deep face-recognition. 

Wang and Deng (2021) refer to face preprocessing adjustment under various conditions, such as poses, illuminations, expressions, and occlusions. They categorize face processing methods into "one-to-many augmentation" and "many-to-one normalization". The "one-to-many augmentation" methods generate many patches or images of the pose variability from a single image to enable deep networks to learn pose-invariant representations. The "many-to-one normalization" methods recover the canonical view of face images from images of a non-frontal view; then, face recognition is performed as if it were under controlled conditions. 

In the context of BR ray recognition, the authors suggest that poses should probably be handled as the two different tasks share this challenge. Therefore, it can be inferred that preprocessing steps for BR ray recognition would also involve handling poses.

However, the specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning are not mentioned in the provided context. Normalization typically involves scaling the pixel intensity values to a range between 0 and 1, while scaling can refer to adjusting the resolution or size of the images. Cleaning usually refers to removing noise or artifacts from the images. Therefore, it is recommended to include these steps in the preprocessing pipeline for training a deep learning model.
