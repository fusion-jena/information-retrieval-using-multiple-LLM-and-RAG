The provided context does not discuss specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the evaluation of eight deep learning algorithms for bird detection using a dataset of 9717 images.

Answer:::
The provided context does not give information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Regularization methods, such as dropout and L2 regularization, are often used in deep learning to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of models and improving their generalization performance. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input neurons to zero during training, helping to prevent co-adaptation of feature detectors. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which shrinks the weights of less important features and encourages the model to distribute the importance of features more evenly.

However, the context focuses on the comparison of different deep learning models for bird detection and their performance in complex, real-world ecological settings. It highlights the Cascade RCNN model's superior performance and the importance of choosing appropriate training times for different models to save computing resources. The context also discusses the potential of deep learning-based approaches for efficient wildlife monitoring and the reduction of manual processing costs.
