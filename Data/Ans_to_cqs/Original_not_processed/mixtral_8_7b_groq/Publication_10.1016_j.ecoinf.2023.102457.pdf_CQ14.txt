Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the BirdNET model were optimized. The text does not mention any specific techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization.

However, it is mentioned that the BirdNET model was derived from the family of residual networks (ResNets) and consists of 157 layers with over 27 million parameters. It was trained using extensive data pre-processing, augmentation, and mixup. These techniques could potentially include methods for hyperparameter optimization, but the text does not provide enough detail to make a definitive conclusion.

Additionally, the BirdNET-Analyzer GitHub repository (<https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Analyzer>) may contain more information about the model's hyperparameters and their optimization. However, the provided context does not contain enough information to determine if this is the case.

In summary, based on the given context, there is no clear information about how the hyperparameters of the BirdNET model were optimized.
