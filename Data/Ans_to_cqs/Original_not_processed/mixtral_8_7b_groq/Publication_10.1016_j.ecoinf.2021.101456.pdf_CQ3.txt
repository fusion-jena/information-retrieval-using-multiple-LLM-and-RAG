The provided context does not directly discuss data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention the use of a small subset of labeled data in a semi-supervised learning setup for clustering.

In a semi-supervised learning setup, a small subset of labeled data is used to optimize a relevant loss and steer learning of representations that are more expressive for downstream tasks. This is achieved by introducing auxiliary tasks based on the labeled data.

In the context of data annotation, this could mean that a small subset of the input data is manually annotated with relevant labels, such as bounding boxes or instance segmentation masks. These annotations can then be used to train a deep learning model in a semi-supervised manner, where the model learns to reconstruct the input data and predict the labels simultaneously.

During training, the model's reconstruction loss and regularization loss are balanced using a weighting factor Î²(t), which is a function of the current training step t. The reconstruction loss encourages the model to accurately reconstruct the input data, while the regularization loss encourages the model to learn a compact and meaningful representation of the data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention data annotation techniques, it does suggest the use of labeled data in a semi-supervised learning setup for clustering. This could involve manually annotating a small subset of the input data with relevant labels, such as bounding boxes or instance segmentation masks, and using these annotations to train a deep learning model in a semi-supervised manner.
