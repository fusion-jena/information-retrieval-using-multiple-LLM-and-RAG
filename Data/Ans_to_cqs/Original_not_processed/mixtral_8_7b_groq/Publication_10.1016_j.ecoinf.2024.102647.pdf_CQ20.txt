Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context focuses on the performance evaluation of machine learning models, specifically Random Forest (RF) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART), in predicting groundwater (GW) salinity hazard maps.

The performance of these models is measured using various criteria, such as coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), correlation coefficient (COR), accuracy, sensitivity, kappa, and area under the curve (AUC). However, there is no mention of deep learning models or the hardware resources used for training them.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide an answer to the query without additional information.
