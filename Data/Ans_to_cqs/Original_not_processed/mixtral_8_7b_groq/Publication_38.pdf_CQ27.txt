Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the exact process that was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer some parts of the process based on the given information.

The deep learning model in this study is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that was used for bat acoustic signal detection. The model is referred to as CNNFULL, and it consists of three convolution and max pooling layers, followed by one fully connected layer. The input to the model is a spectrogram of size 130 frequency bins by 20 time steps, which is obtained by halving the size of the original input spectrogram.

To increase the speed of the system, a faster version of the CNN model, called CNNFAST, was also developed. The CNNFAST network consists of two convolution layers, each followed by a max pooling layer, and it ends with a fully connected layer. The fully connected layer is also evaluated as a convolution, and the output of the detector is a probability vector.

However, the context does not provide information on how the models were deployed, such as model serialization, platform selection, or integration with other systems. It can be assumed that the models were deployed in a suitable environment to perform the intended task of bat acoustic signal detection.

In summary, while the context provides detailed information about the development of the deep learning models for bat acoustic signal detection, it does not explicitly mention the process followed for deploying the trained models.
