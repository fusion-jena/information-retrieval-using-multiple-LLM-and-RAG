Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context includes the title, keywords, and abstract of an article titled "Not seeing the forest for the trees: Generalised linear model out-performs random forest in species distribution modelling for Southeast Asian felids" by Zaneta Kaszta, Eric Ash, and L. Chiaverini, published in the journal Ecological Informatics. The abstract describes the study's use of bootstrapping, generalised linear models, machine learning, and species distribution modeling to analyze Southeast Asian felids at multiple scales. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
