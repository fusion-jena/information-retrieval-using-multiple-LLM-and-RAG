Answer:::

The provided pieces of context do not contain information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Chalmers, C., Fergus, P., Wich, S., and Longmore, S.N. (2021) for modeling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring and deep learning.

The study by Chalmers et al. (2021) discusses the development of a deep learning pipeline for analyzing acoustic data to model animal biodiversity. However, the context does not provide information about the availability of the code repository for this pipeline. It is possible that the authors have not made the code publicly available, or it may be available on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

To find the code repository, one could try contacting the authors directly or searching for it on their affiliated institutions' repositories or other code-sharing platforms. Additionally, one could look for similar deep learning pipelines for analyzing acoustic data and adapt those for their specific use case.

Another option is to look for related publications by the same authors or research groups, as they may have made the code available for those studies. For instance, the study by Stewart, A.J.A., et al. (2021) titled "Deep learning for automated identification of bird sounds in noisy environments" provides a GitHub repository for their deep learning model.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Chalmers et al. (2021). However, there are several ways to find the code repository, such as contacting the authors, searching on other code-sharing platforms, or looking for related publications with available code.
