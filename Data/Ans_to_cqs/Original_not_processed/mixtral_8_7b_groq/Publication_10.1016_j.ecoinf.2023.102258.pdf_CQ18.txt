Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no specific strategy mentioned for monitoring the model performance during training. The text mainly focuses on the comparison of different few-shot learning approaches for sound event detection and their performance evaluation.

However, it does mention that the systems commonly use explicit methods to control the duration of the detected events, which implies that some form of evaluation or monitoring is happening during the post-processing phase. This could include checking the length of detected events and making adjustments as necessary.

Additionally, during the evaluation phase, various metrics such as error rate, F1 score, and detection error rate are used to assess the performance of the models. These metrics could also be used to monitor the model's performance during the training phase, although this is not explicitly stated in the context.

In summary, while the provided context does not give a specific strategy for monitoring the model performance during training, it can be inferred that some form of evaluation or monitoring is happening during the post-processing phase and during the evaluation phase using various metrics.
