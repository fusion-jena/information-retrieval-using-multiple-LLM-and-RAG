The text provided does not give a comprehensive overview of the deep learning pipeline or the specific data collection methods used in it. However, it does describe a study that involves water sample collection for the analysis of water quality parameters, CDOM (Chromophoric Dissolved Organic Matter), and FDOM (Fluorescent Dissolved Organic Matter).

The water samples were collected through four field campaigns conducted in November 2018 and January, April, and July 2019. A total of 119 water samples were collected, with surface water (0.5 m depth) gathered using clean polyethylene bags. The samples were then transported to the laboratory for analysis.

The analysis involved filtering the water samples through Whatman GF/C filters for water quality parameter analysis and through Whatman GF/F filters and a 0.2 Î¼m Millipore pre-combusted filter for CDOM and FDOM spectral analyses. The filtered samples were stored in 150 mL acid-washed amber glass bottles.

Therefore, in the context of this specific study, raw data was collected through field campaigns and laboratory analysis of water samples. This involved the use of polyethylene bags for sample collection, as well as various filters and glass bottles for sample processing and analysis.

However, it is important to note that this may not be representative of the data collection methods used in a deep learning pipeline, which can involve a wide range of data sources such as surveys, sensors, public datasets, and more.
