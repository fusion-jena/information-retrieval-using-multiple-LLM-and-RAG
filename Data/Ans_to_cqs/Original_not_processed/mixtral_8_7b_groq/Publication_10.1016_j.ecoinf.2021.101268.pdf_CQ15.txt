Answer:::

In the deep learning pipeline, various optimization techniques are employed to effectively train models and minimize the loss function. Two such methods are Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular optimization algorithm used in deep learning. It updates the model's parameters by computing the gradient of the loss function concerning each parameter for a single training example or a small batch of examples. This approach allows SGD to converge faster than traditional gradient descent methods, which use the entire training dataset for each update.

Adam, or Adaptive Moment Estimation, is another optimization technique introduced in the paper "Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization" by Kingma and Ba in 2014. Adam combines the advantages of two other optimization methods, AdaGrad and RMSProp, by using the estimated first and second moments of the gradient to adaptively adjust the learning rate for each parameter. This adaptability enables Adam to handle sparse gradients and non-stationary objectives more effectively than SGD.

These optimization techniques are applied during the training phase of deep learning models, where the goal is to minimize the difference between the model's predictions and the actual values. By employing efficient optimization algorithms like SGD and Adam, deep learning pipelines can achieve better performance and faster convergence.
