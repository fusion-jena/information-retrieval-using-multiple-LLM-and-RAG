Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network and its parameters, but it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the neural networks are trained using a feedforward propagation (FP) algorithm based on supervised learning and stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a simple optimization algorithm used in deep learning to minimize the loss function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent. It is a stochastic version of the batch gradient descent algorithm, where the weight updates are calculated using a single training example at a time, rather than the entire training dataset.

However, the context does not mention the use of any other optimization techniques such as Adam, RMSprop, or Adagrad. These optimization algorithms are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to improve the training process and achieve better model performance.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be said that the deep learning pipeline uses stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as an optimization technique. However, the use of other optimization techniques such as Adam, RMSprop, or Adagrad is not mentioned.
