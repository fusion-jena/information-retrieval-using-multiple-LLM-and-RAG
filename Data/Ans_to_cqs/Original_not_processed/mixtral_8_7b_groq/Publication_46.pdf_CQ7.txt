Answer:

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), typically involve dividing the data into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. Although the provided context does not explicitly mention the data splitting criteria, it is a common practice in machine learning and deep learning. Here, we explain these three subsets and their purposes.

1. Training set: This is the portion of data used to train the model by adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the error or loss function. In the context, the authors mention using statistically resampled ecological and atmospheric variables as input parameters for training the CNN model.

2. Validation set: Also known as the development set, this is a subset of data used during the model training process to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model. The validation set helps to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. In the context, although the validation set is not explicitly mentioned, the authors use different kernel sizes and numbers in the convolution layers, which can be seen as a form of hyperparameter tuning.

3. Testing set: This is the final, unseen portion of data used to evaluate the model's performance. The testing set provides an independent assessment of how well the model generalizes to new data. In the context, the authors use the Area Under Curve (AUC) evaluation metric to compare the performance of the CNN and BIOCLIM models, implying the use of a testing set.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data splitting criteria for training a deep learning model like a CNN, it is a common practice to divide the data into training, validation, and testing subsets for training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation, respectively.
