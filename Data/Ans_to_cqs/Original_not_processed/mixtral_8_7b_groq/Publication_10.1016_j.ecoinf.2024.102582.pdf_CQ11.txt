Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. However, it is mentioned that the study utilized the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to retrieve atmospherically corrected United States Geological Survey Landsat Surface reflectance products. The GEE platform is a cloud-based geoprocessing platform that offers a multi-petabyte catalog of satellite imagery, including Landsat imagery.

The study by Halder et al., 2021, also used the GEE platform for monitoring the inter-decade spatial-temporal dynamics of the Sundarban mangrove forest of India from 1990 to 2019. However, there is no information provided about the data repository link for their deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I cannot provide a direct link to the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. However, researchers can access the Landsat imagery and other geospatial data used in the study through the GEE platform.
