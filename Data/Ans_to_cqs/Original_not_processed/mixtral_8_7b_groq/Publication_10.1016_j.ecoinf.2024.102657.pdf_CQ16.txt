Answer:::
In the provided context, there is no specific information given about the criteria used to determine when training of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is complete. However, it is mentioned that the CNN's hyperparameters were tuned using a validation set, which suggests that some form of validation-based early stopping might have been used.

In typical CNN training, various convergence criteria are used to determine when training should be stopped. One common method is to monitor the loss function on a validation set during training. If the loss function on the validation set does not decrease for a certain number of epochs, training is stopped to prevent overfitting. This is known as early stopping.

In the context provided, the CNN's training, validation, and testing were performed using 70%, 10%, and 20% splits of each dialect class's songs, respectively. The validation set was used to tune the CNN's hyperparameters, but no specific details are given about the stopping criterion. It is possible that early stopping based on validation loss plateau was employed, but the context does not explicitly confirm this.

Another possible criterion for determining training completion is to monitor the performance on a separate test set, which is not used during training or hyperparameter tuning. In this case, training could be stopped when the test set performance reaches a satisfactory level or stops improving. However, the context does not provide information about this approach either.

In summary, while the specific criteria used to determine CNN training completion are not provided in the context, it is likely that some form of early stopping based on validation loss plateau was employed.
