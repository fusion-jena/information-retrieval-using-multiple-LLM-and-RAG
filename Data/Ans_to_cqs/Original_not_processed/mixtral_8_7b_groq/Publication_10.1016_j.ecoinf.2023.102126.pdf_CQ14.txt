Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized in the F-UJI tool. The text focuses on the FAIR assessment of datasets using the F-UJI tool and its evaluation based on 16 metrics established in the FAIRsFAIR project. It describes the process of obtaining visualizations of the summaries of each FAIR principle for all eight repositories using a computational notebook report. However, there is no mention of how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized in the F-UJI tool. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
