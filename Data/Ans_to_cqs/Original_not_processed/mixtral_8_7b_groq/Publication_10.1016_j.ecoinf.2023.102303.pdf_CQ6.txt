Answer:::
The provided context discusses the development of deep learning models for a fish dataset in turbid waters, but it does not explicitly mention the data preprocessing steps before training. However, it can be inferred that some preprocessing techniques were applied.

In the context, it is mentioned that the FishInTurbidWater dataset was "quickly and weakly labeled" for contributing to the first weakly-supervised fish dataset in turbid waters. This suggests that some preprocessing steps, such as data cleaning, might have been applied to make the labeling process faster and more efficient.

Furthermore, the semi-supervised contrastive learning model uses a trainable encoder followed by a trainable projection head. Before feeding the images into the encoder, they are augmented with random horizontal flipping, random ±7o rotation, and random ±40% brightness. These augmentation techniques can be considered as part of the preprocessing pipeline.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the data preprocessing steps, it can be inferred that some preprocessing techniques, such as data cleaning and image augmentation, were applied before training the deep learning models.
