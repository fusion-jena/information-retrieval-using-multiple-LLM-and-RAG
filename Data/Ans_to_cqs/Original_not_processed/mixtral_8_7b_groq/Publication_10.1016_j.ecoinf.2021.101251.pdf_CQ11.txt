Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no specific mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link related to it. However, the text does discuss the use of dynamic data citations in data repositories such as GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility). GBIF enables global search and integration of standardized biodiversity records and provides dynamic data citations with DOIs for each consumer data download. Therefore, if the deep learning pipeline in question is related to biodiversity data and utilizes GBIF, it is possible that the data could be accessed and cited through GBIF's data repository with a dynamic data citation.

In the absence of more specific information about the deep learning pipeline and the data repository it is associated with, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query. I would recommend checking the documentation or resources associated with the deep learning pipeline for more information on the data repository and how to access the data.
