Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of a CNN for plant leaf classification and specifies various hyperparameters related to CNN architecture. These include the number of convolution layers, filters, filter size, number of neurons, batch size, and epochs. Additionally, the comparison of the proposed approach with existing transfer learning approaches includes models such as VGG16, Inception V3, MobileNet V2, ResNet 50, DenseNet 121, and Xception, all of which are CNN-based models. The proposed approach itself also outperforms these models in plant leaf classification accuracy, further indicating the use of a CNN in the pipeline.
