Answer:
The study utilized Landsat 8 imagery as the primary source of raw data in the deep learning pipeline for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome of Brazil. Landsat 8 is a satellite launched by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the United States Geological Survey (USGS) that provides multispectral images of the Earth's surface. These images consist of eleven spectral bands with varying spatial resolutions, ranging from 30 to 100 meters. The study specifically used bands 1-7 and 9, which have a spatial resolution of 30 meters, band 8 with a spatial resolution of 15 meters, and did not use bands 10 and 11, which have a spatial resolution of 100 meters.

The Landsat 8 imagery was obtained from the Google Earth Engine Platform, which provides geometrically corrected and preprocessed data. The study focused on the period between May and December, which comprised 98% of fire hotspots detected in 2017 by INPE (National Institute for Space Research in Brazil). The fire hotspot data analysis provided by INPE was used to determine the optimal period for burn scar mapping.

The study did not mention any other sources of raw data, such as surveys or other public datasets. Instead, the authors developed a semi-automatic methodological approach for mapping burned areas using deep learning techniques available on Google Cloud computing and Landsat 8 imagery.

In summary, the study utilized Landsat 8 imagery obtained from the Google Earth Engine Platform as the primary source of raw data in the deep learning pipeline for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome of Brazil. The study did not mention any other sources of raw data, such as surveys or other public datasets.
