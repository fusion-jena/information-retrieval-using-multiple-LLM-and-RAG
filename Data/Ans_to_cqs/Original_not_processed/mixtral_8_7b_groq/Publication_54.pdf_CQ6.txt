Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific data preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the bird data was split into training and testing sets, and then the training set was further divided into training and validation sets. Additionally, the training dataset was augmented 10 times to improve the model's ability to generalize.

Data preprocessing is an essential step in preparing data for deep learning models. Normalization and scaling are common preprocessing techniques used to transform data to a similar range, which can help deep learning models converge faster and improve their performance. Cleaning is another crucial step to remove noise, outliers, or missing values from the data.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific details on the data preprocessing steps taken, it is still essential to perform these steps to ensure the quality of the data and the performance of the deep learning model.
