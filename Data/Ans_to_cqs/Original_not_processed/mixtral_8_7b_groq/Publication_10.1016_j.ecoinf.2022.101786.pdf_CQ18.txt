Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a process called epochs or iterations, where the training on the training set is followed by evaluating performance on the validation set, adjusting CNN node weights, and then repeating the entire cycle. This process is used to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the CNN becomes too specialized in predicting the training set and less able to predict the validation set.

In this study, the model was trained for up to 6000 iterations, with a batch size of 64, 32 subdivisions, and a resolution of 704 Ã— 704. The number of iterations for which the CNN was trained had a strong influence on its performances as well as on the confidence it gives to its predictions. Generally, longer model training past 1000 iterations tended to give higher recall but lower precision.

Moreover, manual annotations were used to generate training, validation, and testing datasets, and Biggle annotations (label name, center x, center y) were utilized. These annotations helped in evaluating the model's performance during training.

Furthermore, the Colab notebook was set to a "high RAM session" to avoid memory limitations that could interrupt the training process. Additionally, a P100 GPU with 16 GB of VRAM memory was used to ensure that the model had sufficient resources for training and evaluation.

Overall, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involved using epochs or iterations, manual annotations, and sufficient resources to prevent overfitting and ensure the model's ability to predict the validation set.
