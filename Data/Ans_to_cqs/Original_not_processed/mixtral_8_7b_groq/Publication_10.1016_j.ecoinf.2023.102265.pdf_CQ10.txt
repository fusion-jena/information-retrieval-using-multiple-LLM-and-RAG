Answer:::

 The provided context does not include information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the use of a pre-trained ResNet-50 model for feature extraction in the context of ecological informatics, but it does not give any details about the code repository or implementation. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the code repository.
