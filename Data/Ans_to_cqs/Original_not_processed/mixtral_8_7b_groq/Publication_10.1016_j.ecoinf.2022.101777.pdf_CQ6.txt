Based on the provided context, there are no specific preprocessing steps mentioned in relation to training a deep learning model. However, there are some steps described in the context that are related to image processing and classification which could be considered as preprocessing for a deep learning model.

First, the 20m bands of the imagery were resampled to 10m to harmonize all band data and ensure that the classification of images was adjusted to this resolution. This can be considered as a form of data resampling or resizing, which is a common preprocessing step in deep learning for image data.

Second, the images were classified using Random Forest (RF), a machine learning technique based on the iterative, random creation of decision trees. Although this is not a deep learning model, it is a form of machine learning that involves feature extraction and classification. In deep learning, feature extraction is often performed as part of the preprocessing step.

Third, the infiltration capacity was quantified using a parameter called CN, which determines the runoff over an area based on soil type, soil cover, and the hydrological group of the soil. Although this is not a preprocessing step for a deep learning model, it is a form of data preprocessing for the image classification task.

Therefore, while there are no specific preprocessing steps mentioned in the context for deep learning, there are some image processing and classification steps that are related to preprocessing for a deep learning model. These include data resampling, feature extraction, and data preprocessing for the image classification task.
