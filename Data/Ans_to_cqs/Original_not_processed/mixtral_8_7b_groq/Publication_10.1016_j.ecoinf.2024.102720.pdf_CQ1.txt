The provided context does not include specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a deep learning algorithm in a strategic planning context (Report 1998) and the publication of a study that used a deep learning algorithm (Ren, Cao, and Du, 2023).

In the study by Ren, Cao, and Du (2023), the authors used a deep learning algorithm to analyze ecosystem service value and changes in food supply and demand in Liaoning Province. The specific data and methods used to train the deep learning model are not described in the paper.

In general, deep learning models require large amounts of data to train, and the data can come from various sources such as surveys, sensors, public datasets, and other sources. The choice of data source depends on the specific problem that the deep learning model is trying to solve.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give a specific answer to the query, it is common for deep learning models to use various data sources such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets for training.
