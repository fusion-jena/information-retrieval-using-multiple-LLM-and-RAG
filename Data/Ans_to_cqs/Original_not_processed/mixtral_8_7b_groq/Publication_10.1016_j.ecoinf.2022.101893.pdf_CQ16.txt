Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the models. The text mainly focuses on the description of the datasets, the performance of different models on the test set, and the proposed pre-training model for feature selection.

However, generally in machine learning, training of a model can be stopped based on several criteria, such as:

1. Validation loss plateau: Training can be stopped when the validation loss stops decreasing or starts increasing, indicating that the model has reached a plateau and further training may lead to overfitting.

2. Early stopping: This technique involves stopping the training process before the model starts to overfit. It is based on monitoring the performance of the model on a validation set during the training process and stopping the training when the performance on the validation set starts to degrade.

3. Number of epochs: Training can be stopped after a fixed number of epochs, which is a complete pass through the entire training dataset.

4. Patience: This is a hyperparameter that specifies the number of epochs to wait before stopping the training if the validation loss does not improve.

5. Monitoring other metrics: Training can also be stopped based on other metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.
