Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention that during each iteration of the training process, the model logs the chosen hyperparameter combinations, associated training times, and loss values. This systematic recording aims to pinpoint the hyper-parameter sets that deliver optimal performance upon completion of the calculations.

However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning model development to include various postprocessing steps after training the model. These steps can include:

1. Model Evaluation Metrics: After training the model, it is essential to evaluate its performance using various metrics. These metrics can include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared for regression tasks. For classification problems, a Confusion Matrix can be used to provide a more detailed breakdown of the model's performance.

2. Saliency Maps: Saliency maps are a technique used to visualize the importance of input features concerning the model's prediction. These maps can help in interpreting the model's decision-making process and understanding which features the model considers most relevant for its predictions.

3. Hyperparameter Tuning: Although the context discusses the use of the TPEBO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization during the training process, it is still worth mentioning that further hyperparameter tuning might be required after the initial training. This iterative process of training and tuning helps in achieving the best possible model performance.

4. Model Interpretability: Model interpretability techniques, such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), can be used to gain insights into the model's behavior and decision-making process.

5. Model Deployment: Once the model has been trained and evaluated, it can be deployed in a production environment to make predictions on new, unseen data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, common practice includes model evaluation metrics, saliency maps, hyperparameter tuning, model interpretability, and model deployment.
