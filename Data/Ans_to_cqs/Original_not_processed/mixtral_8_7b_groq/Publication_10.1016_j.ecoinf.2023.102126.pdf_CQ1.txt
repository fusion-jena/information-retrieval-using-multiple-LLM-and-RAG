The provided context does not contain information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on data sharing practices and sources, particularly in the field of agriculture and ecology. It describes the Web of Science (WOS) categories with the most data, the top data repositories, and the variables imported for each record in a dataset. However, it does not provide information on data collection methods for deep learning.

Deep learning typically involves using large amounts of data to train artificial neural networks. The data can come from various sources, such as surveys, sensors, experiments, simulations, or public datasets. The context does not specify which of these methods are used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer based on the given context. To determine the data collection methods for deep learning, additional information is required, such as the specific deep learning project or application.
