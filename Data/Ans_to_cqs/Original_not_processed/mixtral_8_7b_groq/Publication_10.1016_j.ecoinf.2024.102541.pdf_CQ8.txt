Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the code repository for the deep learning pipeline was not provided in the given context. The context includes several research papers and articles related to deep learning in ecology, but none of them mention or provide a link to the code repository. It is common for research papers to describe their methods and results, but not necessarily to share the code used for the analysis. If you are interested in the specific deep learning model mentioned in the first piece of context, which is a lightweight vehicles detection network model, you may try contacting the authors of the corresponding paper (Dong, Yan, Duan, Aug. 2022) to inquire about the availability of the code.
