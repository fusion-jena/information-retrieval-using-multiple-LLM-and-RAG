The text provided does not give explicit details about the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. However, it does give some context about the preprocessing and training of the model that can be inferred.

First, the orthophotos were preprocessed by dividing each 10,000 × 10,000 pixel image into 1525 tiles of 256 × 256 pixels. The data was then split into three datasets: training (80%), validation (20%), and test (two full images of 10,000 × 10,000 pixels). The training data was used for optimizing the neural network, while the validation dataset was used to assess the performance during the training process. The test dataset was used to assess the performance of the final optimized neural network.

The neural network architecture was determined by hyperparameter fine-tuning, where different numbers of blocks and filters were tested. Scenario 5 was selected as the optimal solution as it had the best values for IoU and accuracy while training on fewer epochs. The resulting architecture is shown in Figure 4 and described in the text.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the model was trained and optimized using preprocessed data, and the architecture was determined through hyperparameter fine-tuning. However, there is no explicit information about the steps taken to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
