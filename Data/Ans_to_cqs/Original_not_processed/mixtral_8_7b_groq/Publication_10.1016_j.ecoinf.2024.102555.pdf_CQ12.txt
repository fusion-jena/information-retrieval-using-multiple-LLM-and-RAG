The specific type of deep learning model used in the study titled "Verification of novel integrations of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning neural network for flood susceptibility mapping" is not explicitly mentioned in the given paper. The paper only mentions the integration of swarm intelligence algorithms into a deep learning neural network for flood susceptibility mapping. Therefore, it is not possible to provide the exact type of deep learning model (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) used in this study based on the given context.
