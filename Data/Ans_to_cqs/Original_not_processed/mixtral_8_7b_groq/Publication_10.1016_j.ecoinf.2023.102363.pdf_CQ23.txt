Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some techniques mentioned that indirectly contribute to the model's generalizability.

Firstly, the model is constructed using the EfficientNet B0 network, which has been pre-trained on a large and diverse dataset for generic image classification. This pre-training provides a good starting point for the model, allowing it to learn features that are generally useful for image classification tasks.

Secondly, during the fine-tuning of the base model with Gulf of Mexico data, the feature extractor remains frozen. This means that the model's lower layers, which have learned more generic features, are not adjusted based on the specifics of the new dataset. This approach helps to prevent overfitting to the new dataset and maintains the generalizability of the model.

Thirdly, the fine-tuning process uses a cyclical learning rate and early stopping. The cyclical learning rate strategy allows the model to explore a wider range of learning rates, which can help the model escape local minima and improve generalization. Early stopping prevents the model from overfitting to the training data by stopping the training process when the validation loss does not improve within a certain number of epochs.

Lastly, the use of DropConnect during fine-tuning can also contribute to the model's generalizability. DropConnect randomly discards the input of the hidden layer, which can help to prevent overfitting by introducing some randomness into the model's learning process.

In conclusion, while there is no explicit mention of measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, the use of transfer learning, frozen feature extractor, cyclical learning rate, early stopping, and DropConnect can help to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
