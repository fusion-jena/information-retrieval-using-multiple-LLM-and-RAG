Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix after the model training. However, it does mention that cross-validation error was used to ascertain the configuration that minimizes the error, thereby enhancing model precision. It also mentions that the regularization parameter ('C') and the kernel type for the SVM model were calibrated through a synergistic application of grid search and cross-validation. These steps are typically used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model.

In the literature review section, it discusses the analytical resolution of the decision-making model, which includes theorems and corollaries that establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions within the model framework. This is a mathematical analysis of the model rather than a postprocessing step.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, it does mention the use of cross-validation error and calibration of the model's parameters to evaluate the performance of the model.
