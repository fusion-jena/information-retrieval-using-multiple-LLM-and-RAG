Based on the information provided, there is no explicit description of a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, we can infer that the performance of the model is evaluated by analyzing the results of the Ecological Source Area (ESA) obtained using different parameter settings in the study of artificial intelligence.

In the experiment, three different scenarios were considered with varying parameters such as initial population (P) and minimum fitness values. The ESA was calculated for each scenario, and several evaluation metrics were computed, including source coverage area, source coverage rate, source connectivity rate, fragmentation index, IIC, and PC. The specific values of these metrics were not provided, but it can be inferred that they were used to assess the quality of the ESA and the performance of the model.

Moreover, the study mentions that the algorithm was capable of identifying the optimal ESA when P = 50, with a high source connectivity rate (84.99%), a high IIC value (0.81), the highest ecological source coverage rate, and a low fragmentation index. This comparison of results across different scenarios suggests that the performance of the model was monitored by analyzing the outcomes of the ESA and comparing them to identify the optimal parameter settings.

In summary, while there is no explicit description of a strategy to monitor the model performance during training, the study infers that the performance was evaluated by analyzing the ESA results and comparing the evaluation metrics across different scenarios.
