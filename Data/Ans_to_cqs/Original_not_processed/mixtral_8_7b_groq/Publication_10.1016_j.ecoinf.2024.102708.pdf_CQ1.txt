Answer:::

The article does not provide explicit information about the method used for collecting the raw data. However, it can be inferred that drone imagery is used to collect the data for this deep learning pipeline. This is suggested by the title of the article, "Drone imagery and deep learning for mapping the density of wild Pacific oysters to manage their expansion into protected areas." Additionally, the abstract mentions the use of "drone imagery" and "remote sensing" in the context of mapping Pacific oyster distributions. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the raw data was collected through aerial imaging using drones.

Once the drone imagery is collected, it is processed into individual tiles, resulting in a dataset of 3643 tiles for the Scoble site and 7571 tiles for the Collapit site. These tiles are then used to train and validate a deep learning model for mapping Pacific oyster densities.

It is worth noting that the article also mentions the use of "remote sensing" in addition to drone imagery. Remote sensing is a broad term that can encompass various data collection methods, including satellite imagery, aerial photography, and other forms of sensor data. However, in this context, it seems that drone imagery is the primary source of data.

The article "Drone imagery and deep learning for mapping the density of wild Pacific oysters to manage their expansion into protected areas" utilizes drone imagery as the primary method for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The drone imagery is used to create individual tiles, which are then used to train and validate a deep learning model for mapping Pacific oyster densities.

The use of drone imagery allows for high-resolution aerial imaging, which can be particularly useful for mapping the distribution of small organisms such as Pacific oysters. The tiles created from the drone imagery are used to create a dataset of 3643 tiles for the Scoble site and 7571 tiles for the Collapit site.

In addition to drone imagery, the article mentions the use of "remote sensing" in the abstract. Remote sensing is a broad term that can encompass various data collection methods, including satellite imagery, aerial photography, and other forms of sensor data. However, in this context, it seems that drone imagery is the primary source of data.

It is important to note that the article does not provide explicit information about other methods used for collecting raw data, such as surveys or public datasets. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that drone imagery is the primary method used for data collection in this study.

Overall, the use of drone imagery in this deep learning pipeline allows for high-resolution aerial imaging, which can be particularly useful for mapping the distribution of small organisms such as Pacific oysters. By creating individual tiles from the drone imagery, the authors are able to train and validate a deep learning model for mapping Pacific oyster densities.
