I'm sorry, but there is no information provided in the context about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on comparing different deep learning architectures such as ResNet, RepVGG, and MobileNet-V3, and discussing their performance in terms of parameters, speed, and accuracy. However, it does not mention any code repository or GitHub link related to these models or the deep learning pipeline.
