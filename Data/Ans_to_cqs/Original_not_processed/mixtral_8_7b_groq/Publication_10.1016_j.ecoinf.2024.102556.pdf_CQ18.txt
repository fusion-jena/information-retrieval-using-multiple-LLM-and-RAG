Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of the Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) metric to compare the performance of the Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (SORT) model and the DeepSORT model using Feature Encoding Networks (FENs). The MOTA metric is used to evaluate the accuracy of the tracking algorithms by considering factors such as false positives, false negatives, and identity switches.

The results presented in the article indicate that the DeepSORT model using FENs outperforms the SORT model in terms of MOTA. This suggests that the FEN network extracts more and richer target information features during the tracking process, leading to improved tracking accuracy. Additionally, the number of IDs allocated by the SORT model exceeded the number of IDs allocated by the DeepSORT model, further supporting the superior performance of the DeepSORT model.

Furthermore, the authors plan to optimize the detection model and implement migration learning during training to improve detection accuracy. They also aim to modify the FEN to be as lightweight as possible while maintaining accuracy, making it more adaptable to Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) platforms with limited computational resources. These strategies will enable more effective monitoring and conservation of the Procapra przewalskii species.

In summary, the strategy for monitoring model performance during training involves the use of the MOTA metric to compare the performance of the SORT and DeepSORT models using FENs. The DeepSORT model has been shown to outperform the SORT model, and the authors plan to further optimize the detection model and modify the FEN to improve accuracy and adaptability to UAV platforms.
