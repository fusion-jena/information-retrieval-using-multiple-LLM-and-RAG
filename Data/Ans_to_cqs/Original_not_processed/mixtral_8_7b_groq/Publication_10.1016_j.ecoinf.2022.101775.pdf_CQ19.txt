Answer:::

The specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, we can make an educated guess that PyTorch is one of the frameworks used based on the following information.

The paper "Pytorch-biggraph: A large-scale graph embedding system" by Lerer et al. (2019) is cited in the context, which indicates that PyTorch is a deep learning framework familiar to the authors. Additionally, the models are constructed with an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) having four hidden layers followed by a ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) non-linear activation function and an output layer followed by a Sigmoid non-linear activation function. This architecture is quite general and can be implemented in various deep learning frameworks, including PyTorch.

Furthermore, the authors added dropout to the first hidden layer to avoid overfitting, which is a common regularization technique in deep learning. These details suggest that the authors have a good understanding of deep learning concepts and are likely using a deep learning framework to build their models.

However, it is important to note that the context does not explicitly mention TensorFlow or any other deep learning framework. Therefore, while PyTorch is a strong possibility, it is not certain that it is the only framework used.
