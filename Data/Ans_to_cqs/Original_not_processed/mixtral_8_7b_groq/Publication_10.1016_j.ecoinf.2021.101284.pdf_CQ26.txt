The provided context discusses the data processing and analysis of Big Data related to environmental conditions, air pollution, and COVID-19 cases. It also explains the standardization technique used for preprocessing the data. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.

Nonetheless, some of the techniques that can be used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified sampling: Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that involves dividing the population into homogeneous subgroups or strata and then taking a simple random sample from each stratum. This method ensures that each stratum is proportionally represented in the sample, reducing bias and improving the accuracy of the model.
2. Oversampling: Oversampling is a technique used to increase the representation of the minority class in an imbalanced dataset. This method involves creating synthetic samples of the minority class using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling). Oversampling helps to reduce bias and improve the performance of the model.
3. Undersampling: Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the representation of the majority class in an imbalanced dataset. This method involves randomly selecting a subset of the majority class to balance the dataset. Undersampling helps to reduce bias and improve the performance of the model.
4. Diverse data collection: Diverse data collection involves gathering data from various sources, including different geographical locations, demographic groups, and time periods. This method ensures that the data is representative of the population and reduces bias.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be used to reduce bias and improve the accuracy of the model.
