Answer:::

The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. However, it does mention the use of a random seed value in the context of the "sisds methodology" (Kuru et al., 2013). This methodology is used for report generation in medical applications, but it does not specifically address deep learning or randomness.

In general, there are several strategies that can be employed to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines. One common approach is to set a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This is important for debugging and for comparing different models or experiments. For example, in Python, the numpy and tensorflow libraries allow you to set a random seed value to ensure consistent random number generation.

Another strategy for handling randomness is to use techniques such as dropout and data augmentation. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out neurons during training, which helps to prevent overfitting and improves the generalization of the model. Data augmentation involves creating new training examples by applying random transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping. This increases the size and diversity of the training set, which can improve the robustness and performance of the model.

Finally, it is important to note that deep learning models themselves can introduce randomness, particularly during the training process. For example, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular optimization algorithm that involves randomly sampling mini-batches of data to update the model weights. This introduces some randomness into the training process, which can help to escape local minima and improve the final model.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, there are several common approaches that can be used. These include setting a fixed random seed value, using techniques such as dropout and data augmentation, and leveraging the inherent randomness of optimization algorithms like SGD.
