Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific details about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned from the data, but instead are set prior to the learning process. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.

Grid search involves specifying a range of possible values for each hyperparameter, and then training the model with all possible combinations of those values. This can be computationally expensive, especially if the number of hyperparameters is large.

Random search is a more efficient alternative to grid search, where instead of trying all possible combinations, a smaller number of combinations are randomly sampled. This can still provide a good estimate of the optimal hyperparameters, while requiring fewer computational resources.

Bayesian optimization is a more sophisticated method that uses Bayesian inference to iteratively select the next set of hyperparameters to try, based on the performance of previous trials. This can often find the optimal hyperparameters more efficiently than grid or random search.

Without more specific information from the context, it is not possible to say which of these methods (if any) were used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model in this case.
