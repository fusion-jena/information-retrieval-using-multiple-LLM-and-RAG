Answer:::
The purpose of a deep learning model, as indicated by the context, is primarily for classification. The models mentioned in the text, such as AlexNet, NiN, VGG, GoogLeNet, and ResNet, are all used for image classification tasks. These models are designed to automatically extract multiple levels of abstraction from raw data, specifically from image data, and use convolutional operations to extract information from overlapping small regions coming from the previous layers. The final layer of these models is typically a softmax function, which provides estimated probabilities of the image belonging to different classes.

For instance, ResNet, which is the winning architecture of the 2016 ImageNet competition, is designed to be computationally efficient while offering high accuracy for image classification tasks. The number of layers for the ResNet architecture can be different, with the work mentioned in the context trying 18, 34, 50, 101, and 152 layers.

Additionally, the context also mentions a dataset of camera-trap images used for wildlife ecology, which is likely to be used for image classification tasks as well. The dataset is split into training and test sets, indicating the intention to train a deep learning model for image classification.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning models mentioned is primarily for image classification.
