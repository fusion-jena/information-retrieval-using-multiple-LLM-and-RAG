The provided context discusses a deep learning approach for generating a temporal acoustic activity record specific to each target species, but it does not directly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention that the neural network training and validation process involves splitting the recordings into five training folds, which suggests that cross-validation may be used. Cross-validation can help manage randomness by training and validating the model on different subsets of the data, reducing the impact of any randomness present in the data or the model initialization.

Furthermore, the process of aggregating 8-second interval predictions into hourly prediction records and normalizing by the number of 8-second intervals recorded during that hour can also help account for randomness. This normalization ensures that any missing audio data does not artificially minimize or magnify the prediction record across the five folds.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, it does suggest that cross-validation and data normalization techniques are employed to manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
