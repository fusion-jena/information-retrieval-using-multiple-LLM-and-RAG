Answer:::

The provided context does not contain specific information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that machine learning models (MLMs), which include deep learning models, were used and their performance was evaluated. The models were assessed using metrics such as AUC, TSS, Kappa, and phi, and it was found that the models exhibited high consistency.

In general, when deploying a trained deep learning model, there are several steps that are typically followed. First, the model is usually saved or serialized, which involves converting the model into a format that can be stored and loaded again later. This is often done using a format such as JSON or XML, or using a specific library or framework's serialization functionality.

Once the model is serialized, it can be loaded and deployed on a platform. The choice of platform will depend on a variety of factors, including the intended use case, the resources available, and the desired level of scalability. Common platforms for deploying deep learning models include local servers, cloud-based platforms, and edge devices.

When deploying a deep learning model, it is also important to consider issues such as model versioning, monitoring, and maintenance. Model versioning involves keeping track of different versions of the model and being able to roll back to a previous version if necessary. Monitoring involves tracking the model's performance in production and identifying any issues or errors that may arise. Maintenance involves regularly updating the model and addressing any issues that are identified.

Overall, while the provided context does not contain specific information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it is clear that machine learning models were used and evaluated. When deploying a deep learning model, it is important to follow best practices such as serialization, platform selection, and monitoring.
