Answer:::
The context provided does not give information about the data repository of the FishInTurbidWater dataset. However, it is mentioned that the dataset was collected and weakly labeled for the purpose of developing two novel deep learning networks. The first network uses semi-supervised contrastive learning, and the second network uses a weakly-supervised DNN ensemble technique. The ensemble technique significantly improves the overall accuracy compared to the two weakly-supervised individual DNNs.

For the semi-supervised contrastive learning approach, a self-supervised contrastive learning model was first trained and then fine-tuned on the weakly labeled dataset. This method requires only a small portion of the weakly labeled dataset, making the development cycle fast while producing a high accuracy of 89%.

For the weakly-supervised DNN ensemble approach, two state-of-the-art DNNs were first trained on ImageNet, and then transfer learning was performed on the weakly labeled dataset. The two weakly-supervised DNNs were then ensembled using the XGBoost technique.

The context also mentions that ImageNet is a huge visual dataset with fourteen million images, designed for object recognition tasks. It has been hand-annotated with bounding boxes to indicate what objects are present and where in the images.

Therefore, while the specific data repository for the FishInTurbidWater dataset is not provided, it can be inferred that the dataset was used in conjunction with the ImageNet dataset for developing the deep learning networks. It is possible that the FishInTurbidWater dataset may be available in one of the repositories mentioned, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, or it may be available on the researchers' institution's repository. However, further information would be needed to determine the exact location of the dataset.
