The context provided does not give information about the specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset is divided into three sets for training, validating, and testing the model, with a total of 37,774 images. The images are obtained through a semantic segmentation process from satellite images, resulting in four classes: urban, bare soil, vegetation, and road. Each image contains the real value of pixels of the extracted class and zero for the values of the other classes. The images are then divided into non-overlapping blocks of 256 Ã— 256 pixels and saved into folders according to the corresponding class.

Therefore, the dataset used in this deep learning pipeline is a custom dataset created from satellite images, and it is not one of the commonly used datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
