Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about post-processing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix after the model training. The text describes the process of training a recognizer model using Kaleidoscope Pro software, which involves several steps before and after the model training. However, it does not mention any specific post-processing steps involving saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

First, the authors optimized a recognizer via automated and manual processes and applied it to a set of manually validated recordings to evaluate its performance. Then, they applied the recognizer to a large set of recordings, which usually is the real aim of the study. The data processing involved creating eight different subsets of recordings, including six different training sets, a test set, and a target set of recordings.

After the model training, the authors performed the following steps: (1) they re-ran the recording and the edited cluster analysis to create an advanced classifier, (2) they ran the recognizer on the test set to evaluate its performance, and (3) they applied the same recognizer to the target set to obtain biologically relevant results.

Therefore, while the text provides details about the data processing and model training steps, it does not explicitly mention any post-processing steps involving saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Answer:::
The provided context does not include information about post-processing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix after the model training. The text describes the process of training a recognizer model using Kaleidoscope Pro software and the subsequent steps involved in applying the model to a large set of recordings.
