Answer:::

The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a random grid search approach. This involves randomly selecting a combination of hyperparameters from a predefined set of possible values and evaluating the performance of the model with these settings. The hyperparameters considered in this process include the number of trees, the maximum depth of trees, the subsample ratio of columns used for each tree, and the model learning rate. The combination of hyperparameters that results in the best performance of the model is then selected for use in the final model.
