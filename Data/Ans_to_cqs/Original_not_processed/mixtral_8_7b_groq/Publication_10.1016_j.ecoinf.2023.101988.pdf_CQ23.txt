Answer:::

The provided context does not directly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model from the study "Modelling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring and deep learning" by Chalmers et al., 2021. However, there are some techniques commonly used to enhance the generalizability of deep learning models that can be inferred or assumed based on the information given.

1. Diverse dataset: The study uses acoustic monitoring to model animal biodiversity, which implies that the dataset likely contains a wide variety of animal sounds from different species. A diverse dataset can help the deep learning model generalize better to new, unseen data.

2. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance and generalizability of machine learning models. Although not explicitly mentioned, the use of cross-validation is a common practice in deep learning model development.

3. Stratified splitting: Stratified splitting is a method used to divide a dataset into training, validation, and testing sets while preserving the original dataset's class distribution. The context does not explicitly mention the use of stratified splitting, but it is a common practice when working with imbalanced datasets.

4. Transfer learning: Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned on a new dataset. This method can help improve the generalizability of the model, especially when the new dataset is relatively small. The context does not explicitly mention the use of transfer learning, but it is a common practice in deep learning model development.

Without explicit information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer. However, based on common practices in deep learning model development, it is reasonable to assume that some or all of these techniques were employed.
