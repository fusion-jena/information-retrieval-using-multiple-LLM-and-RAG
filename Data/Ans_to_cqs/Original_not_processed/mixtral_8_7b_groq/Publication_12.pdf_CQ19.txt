Answer:::
The text provided does not give explicit information about which deep learning framework was used to build the Waveman model. However, it does mention the use of the Scikit-learn library for machine learning in Python, which is not a deep learning framework but rather a library for general machine learning tasks. Therefore, it is possible that a deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch was used in conjunction with Scikit-learn, but this information is not provided in the text.

The text does mention the use of Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) for training the model, which suggests that a deep learning framework was used since GPUs are commonly used for deep learning tasks due to their ability to perform parallel computations. Additionally, the text mentions the use of a neural network architecture called BatNet, which was modified and optimized for the Waveman model. BatNet is a deep learning model for acoustic signal processing and was proposed in a research paper, but the text does not specify how it was implemented.

In summary, while the text provides information about the use of Scikit-learn and a GPU for building the Waveman model, it does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework was used. Therefore, the answer to this query is not explicitly stated in the provided text.
