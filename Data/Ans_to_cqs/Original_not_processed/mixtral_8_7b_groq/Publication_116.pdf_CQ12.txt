Answer:::

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the architecture details provided in the context. The model includes several layers of convolution, max pooling, batch normalization, and Local Response Normalization (LRN), which are all components commonly used in CNNs. Additionally, there is no mention of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Transformer components in the architecture. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network.
