Answer:::

To monitor the performance of the IUC-NN model during training, the authors implemented a cross-validation strategy. Specifically, they randomly split the dataset into a training set (90% of the entries) and a test set (10%). Then, they used 20% of the training set for validation. Since the size of the dataset was relatively small, they performed cross-validation by shifting the validation set five times. This allowed them to quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy of the model.

Additionally, they trained a range of models with different numbers of hidden layers and subsets of features. They selected the neural network with the lowest cross-entropy loss across these models to predict the conservation status of all orchid species at two levels: binary (possibly threatened vs. not threatened) and detailed (CR, EN, VU, NT, and LC).

By using cross-validation and monitoring the validation cross-entropy loss, the authors were able to evaluate the performance of the IUC-NN model and select the best model for predicting the conservation status of orchid species. This strategy helped to ensure that the model was not overfitting to the training data and was able to generalize well to new, unseen data.
