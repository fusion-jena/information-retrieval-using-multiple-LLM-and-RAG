Based on the provided context, there is no mention of any standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, there are several studies that have used their own datasets for training and testing their deep learning models.

For instance, Uzlu (2021) used a dataset consisting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, population size, and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Turkey for training a three-layer feedforward back-propagation neural network. Similarly, Wei et al. (2020) used a dataset consisting of sludge generation, treatment, and disposal data from China for training a deep learning model to analyze CO2-equivalent emissions.

In addition, Yan et al. (2019) used a dataset consisting of greenhouse gas emissions from municipal wastewater treatment plants in China from 2005 to 2014 for training a deep learning model to analyze the spatial and temporal distribution of emissions.

Therefore, while there are no standard deep learning datasets mentioned in the provided context, there are several studies that have used their own datasets for training and testing deep learning models.
