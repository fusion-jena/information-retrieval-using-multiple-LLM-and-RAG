Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the deep learning model in use is BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), and it is being employed for text classification tasks.

BERT is a transformer-based model that has been widely used for various natural language processing tasks, including text classification. The model is designed to handle input sequences of up to 512 tokens. However, since the web articles being classified are longer than this limit, the documents are split into chunks of 300 tokens using the NLTK word-tokenizer. The chunks that contain any of the original query terms related to bats or exploitation are retained. If multiple chunks contain keywords, the first such chunk is used for model training and evaluation. Before being fed into the BERT model, the texts are tokenized using the BERT tokenizer, with a maximum number of tokens set to 400 for social media posts and 512 for web articles.

The context also mentions that the computational resources required to train transformer models like BERT can be substantial. Therefore, the practical benefits of using such models for simpler classification tasks should be carefully considered.

In summary, the deep learning model in use is BERT, and it is being utilized for text classification tasks. The model handles input sequences of up to 512 tokens, and longer documents are split into chunks and truncated as necessary to fit this limit.
