Based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which specific deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used to build the model. The context focuses on the statistical methods and evaluation metrics used for model selection and does not mention any deep learning frameworks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
