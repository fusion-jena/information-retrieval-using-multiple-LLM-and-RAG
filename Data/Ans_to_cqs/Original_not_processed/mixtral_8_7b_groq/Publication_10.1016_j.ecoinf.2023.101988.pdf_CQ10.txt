Answer:::

I was unable to find a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the context provided. However, the context suggests that the deep learning pipeline was used in the study titled "Modeling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring and deep learning" by Chalmers, Fergus, Wich, and Longmore published in the 2021 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks.

The study likely used a deep learning model to identify animal species from acoustic monitoring data. While the specific code repository was not provided, the authors mentioned using Python and TensorFlow in their study.

Therefore, if you are interested in the code for the deep learning pipeline, I would recommend looking for deep learning models for animal biodiversity or acoustic monitoring on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, specifically searching for repositories written in Python and using TensorFlow.

Additionally, you may contact the authors of the study for more information on their deep learning pipeline.
