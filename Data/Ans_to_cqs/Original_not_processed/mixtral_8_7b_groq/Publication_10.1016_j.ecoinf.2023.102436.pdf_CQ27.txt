Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on the use of deep learning models for ecological informatics and landscape analysis, but it does not discuss the specifics of model deployment.

However, we can infer some possible steps based on general practices in deep learning model deployment:

1. Model serialization: After training the deep learning model, the model's architecture, weights, and biases are saved to a file, often in a platform-agnostic format like JSON or Protocol Buffers. This step ensures that the trained model can be loaded and used for inference on different platforms.

2. Platform selection: The choice of platform for deploying the deep learning model depends on the specific use case and the infrastructure available. For instance, the model could be deployed on a local machine for offline inference, or on a cloud platform for scalable, on-demand inference. Common cloud platforms for deep learning model deployment include Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft Azure.

3. Model adaptation: Depending on the platform and the target environment, the deep learning model might need to be adapted or optimized for efficient deployment. For instance, the model might be quantized (i.e., converted to lower-precision representations) or pruned (i.e., removing less important connections) to reduce its computational requirements.

4. Integration with applications: The deployed deep learning model is typically integrated with other applications or services that use it for inference. For example, the model might be used within a web application, a mobile app, or a larger data processing pipeline.

Please note that these steps are inferred from general practices in deep learning model deployment and might not apply to the specific case described in the provided context.
