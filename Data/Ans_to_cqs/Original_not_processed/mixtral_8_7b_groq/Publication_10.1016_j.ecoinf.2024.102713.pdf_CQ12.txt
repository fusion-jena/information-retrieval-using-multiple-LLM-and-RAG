Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific deep learning model (such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer) used in the pipeline. The text focuses on describing the data platform's structure, data sources, integration, enrichment, validation, and loading processes. It does not mention any details about the deep learning models or techniques applied in the pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this question with the given context.
