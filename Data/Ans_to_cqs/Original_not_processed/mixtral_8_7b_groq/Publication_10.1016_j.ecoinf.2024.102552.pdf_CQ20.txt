Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The text discusses the use of machine learning methods, including for automatic or supervised classification, but it does not mention the type of hardware used for training these models.

However, it is important to note that deep learning models typically require significant computational resources for training, including the use of specialized hardware such as graphics processing units (GPUs) or tensor processing units (TPUs). These types of hardware are capable of performing the large number of matrix and vector operations required for training deep learning models more efficiently than traditional central processing units (CPUs).

The context does mention that machine learning methods were used for quantitative comparisons and for the classification of imagery. It also notes that the quality of the inputs (both imagery and training data) can impact the performance of these methods. Therefore, it is possible that specialized hardware was used for training the deep learning models, but this information is not provided in the text.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model, it is likely that specialized hardware such as GPUs or TPUs were used given the nature of the computations required for training deep learning models.
