Answer:::
The performance of the deep learning models in the given context is evaluated using the F1-score, which is a harmonic mean of precision and recall. The F1-score is a widely used metric for evaluating the performance of binary classification models, and it ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect precision and recall.

In the first piece of context, the F1-score is used to compare the performance of different CNN architectures. The authors report the F1-score of 84.93% for a CNN architecture with 11 of 18 layers and 7,047,754 learnable parameters. They also report the F1-score of 69.1% and 81.7% for ResNetV50 and InceptionNetV3, respectively, which have many more parameters (more than 20,000,000). The authors use the F1-score to compare the training and validation performance of these models and conclude that the models with many parameters overfit the training data, and more training data are needed.

In the second piece of context, the authors report the F1-score of 92.75% for the chosen CNN architecture, which indicates that the trained CNN model is very accurate in its predictions. The authors also report the average precision, recall, and F1-score of 93%, which indicates a suitable model classification.

In the third piece of context, the authors compare their customized CNN architectures with selected state-of-the-art CNN optimized architectures, including EfficientNetB0 and DenseNet121. They report the F1-score of 88.62% for EfficientNetB0, which is lower than their top five best architectures.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the F1-score is the primary metric used in the given context to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models. However, other metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall could also be used, but they are not reported in the provided context.
