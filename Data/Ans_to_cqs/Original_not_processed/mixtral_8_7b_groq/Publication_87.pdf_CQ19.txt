Answer:::
The PyTorch deep learning library is used to build the deep learning model in the case study. This information is provided in the first reference, which is a paper about PyTorch. The paper's title is "PyTorch: An Imperative Style, High-Performance Deep Learning Library" and it was written by Paszke et al. in 2019. The library is used to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for identifying animal species in images.

The Reticulate package, which provides an R interface to Python, is used to call PyTorch from R. This is mentioned in the fourth reference, which is a paper about Reticulate. The paper's title is "Reticulate: R Interface to Python" and it was written by Allaire et al. in 2017.

The specific architecture of the CNN model used in the case study is a resnet18, as shown in the code snippet provided. This architecture is available in PyTorch through the resnet18() function.
