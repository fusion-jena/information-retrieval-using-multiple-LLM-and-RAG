Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves several techniques, including accuracy calculation, misclassified images tracking, and the use of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heat maps.

Firstly, the accuracy of the model is calculated for both the training and validation sets at each taxonomic level (species, genus, and subfamily). This metric provides a general idea of the model's performance. For instance, at the species level, the training set accuracy is 100% for all three models, while the validation set accuracy is 98.78%, 99.86%, and 99.86%. This indicates that the models perform exceptionally well on the training set but still have room for improvement on the validation set.

Secondly, the number of misclassified images is tracked for both the training and validation sets at each taxonomic level. This metric offers more detailed insights into the model's performance. For example, at the species level, there are 18 misclassified images in the training set and 7 misclassified images in the validation set for the first model. This information can be used to identify specific images or categories that the model struggles with, allowing for targeted improvements.

Lastly, Grad-CAM is used to generate heat maps that highlight the most important regions of the input images for the model's classification decision. These heat maps can provide valuable insights into which morphological characters the model relies on for classification. In the figure provided, the percentages next to each heat map indicate the proportion of the respective morphological trait used for successful classification in the training set. This information can be used to ensure that the model is using a diverse set of features for classification and not relying too heavily on any single feature.

In summary, the strategy for monitoring model performance during training involves calculating accuracy, tracking misclassified images, and using Grad-CAM to generate heat maps. These techniques allow for a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance, enabling targeted improvements.
