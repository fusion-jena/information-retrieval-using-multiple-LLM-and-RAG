Answer:::

Based on the information provided, it does not appear that a deep learning model was used in this research. The study focuses on developing a framework for automatically standardizing fish freshness classes using a clustering approach. The dataset used in the study consists of six organoleptic parameters applied to seven fish species, generated over 11 days. However, the context does not mention the use of any deep learning techniques or measures taken to ensure the generalizability of such a model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
