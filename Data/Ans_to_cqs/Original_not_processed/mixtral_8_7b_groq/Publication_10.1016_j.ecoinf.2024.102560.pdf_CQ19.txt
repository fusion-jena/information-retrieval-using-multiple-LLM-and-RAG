Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the framework used to build the deep learning model. The contexts mention the use of artificial neural networks in relation to water resource management and soil salinity prediction, but they do not specify the particular framework used for developing the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
