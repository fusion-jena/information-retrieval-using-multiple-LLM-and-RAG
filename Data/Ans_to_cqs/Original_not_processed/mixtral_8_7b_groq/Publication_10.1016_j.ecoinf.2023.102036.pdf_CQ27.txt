Based on the provided context, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model seems to include model serialization but does not explicitly mention platform selection.

The researchers appear to have optimized the model training parameters using a standard approach for most research teams becoming familiar with deep learning. The optimization involved 3000 train iterations with a batch size of 25 individuals, validating every 300 iterations, and using TensorBoard for performance monitoring. The selected parameters correspond to the run shown in Supplementary Fig. S3.

After optimizing the model, the context mentions that the "trained model" was used for the subsequent analysis. However, it does not provide explicit details about the deployment process, such as model serialization formats (e.g., HDF5, Tensorflow SavedModel, or ONNX) or platform selection (e.g., cloud-based services, local servers, or edge devices).

Answer:::
The provided context explains the optimization process for a deep learning model, including the selection of parameters such as learning rate, momentum, standard deviation threshold, and input size. However, it does not offer explicit details about the model serialization format or platform selection for deploying the trained model.
