Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the study uses aerial images for the deep learning pipeline. There is no explicit mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV. The focus of the study is on analyzing aerial images of the Kruger National Park (KNP) taken every two years, using deep learning methods to map land cover or more specifically woody cover.

The study integrates large-area historical datasets in land-use and land-cover analysis, which suggests that historical aerial images or other forms of geospatial data may be used in conjunction with the deep learning methods. However, the context does not provide specific details about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
