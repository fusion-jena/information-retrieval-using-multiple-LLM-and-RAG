Based on the provided context, there is no information suggesting that traditional data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling were applied in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, the focus was on configuring the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and preprocessing the input data for the specific use case of air quality prediction in Modena.

The data preprocessing steps included:

1. Reshaping the dataset: The dataset was reshaped to have each observation consist of a temporal window of 12 previous observations (2 hours) with multiple features.
2. Feature scaling: A MinMaxScaler was used to transform each feature to a [0-1] range.
3. Adding a dropout layer: A dropout layer was added as a regularization method to randomly exclude some inputs from activation and weight updates while training the network.

The LSTM model was trained using the mean squared error (MSE) as the loss function and the ADAM optimization algorithm. The performance of the LSTM model was compared with other recurrent neural network architectures, such as Multilayer Perceptron and Gate Recurrent Unit, and it proved to have better results.

In summary, while traditional data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling were not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, the deep learning pipeline involved several data preprocessing steps and model configurations tailored for the specific use case of air quality prediction.
