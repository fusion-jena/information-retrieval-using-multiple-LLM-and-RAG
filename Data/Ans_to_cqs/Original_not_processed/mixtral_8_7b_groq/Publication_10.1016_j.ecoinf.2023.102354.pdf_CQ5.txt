Answer:::

The text provided does not give information about the specific deep learning pipeline or the datasets used in it, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention several datasets that are used in the context of groundwater-climate interactions and ecological informatics.

These datasets include TWS (terrestrial water storage), SMS (soil moisture storage), GWS (groundwater storage), SPEI (standard precipitation evapotranspiration index), ENSO (El-Ni√±o southern oscillation), NAO (North Atlantic oscillation), AMO (Atlantic multidecadal oscillation), PDO (Pacific decadal oscillation), IOD (Indian ocean dipole), NTA (North Tropical Atlantic), STA (South Tropical Atlantic), and ETA (Equatorial Atlantic).

Additionally, there are references to specific studies that have used various datasets for hydrological and ecological analysis. For example, Yang et al. (2019) studied the risk of hydrological drought in the Tarim River basin, Northwest China, while Dewan (2023b) conducted a global assessment of drought characteristics in the Anthropocene. Zhang et al. (1997) analyzed ENSO-like interdecadal variability, and Ojha et al. (2020) studied the recovery of aquifer-systems in the southwest US following the 2012-2015 drought.

Therefore, while the provided text does not directly answer the query about the specific deep learning datasets, it does provide information about various datasets used in related fields.
