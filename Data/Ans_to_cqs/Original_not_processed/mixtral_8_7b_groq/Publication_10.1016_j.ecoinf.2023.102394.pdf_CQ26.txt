Answer:::

The provided context discusses various studies related to machine learning, deep learning, and soil organic carbon, but it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide a general answer based on common practices in the field.

There are several techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These techniques include:

1. Stratified splitting: Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures each subset (or "stratum") of the population has approximately the same percentage of observations as the entire population. This method can be used during the splitting of data into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure that each set has a similar distribution of classes.
2. Oversampling: Oversampling is a technique used to increase the number of instances of the minority class in an imbalanced dataset. This can be done by randomly duplicating instances of the minority class or by using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic instances.
3. Undersampling: Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the number of instances of the majority class in an imbalanced dataset. This can be done by randomly removing instances of the majority class. However, this technique may result in loss of information.
4. Diverse data collection: Collecting diverse data is a proactive approach to reducing data bias. By collecting data from a variety of sources, it is more likely that the dataset will be representative of the population.

These techniques can help to ensure that the deep learning model is trained on a dataset that is representative of the population and reduce the risk of bias in the model's predictions. It is important to note that the choice of technique will depend on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the problem being solved.
