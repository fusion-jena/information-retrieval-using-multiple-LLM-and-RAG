Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the use of a deep learning model, let alone the platform it was deployed on. The context focuses on the use of an ensemble modeling approach in the BIOMOD2 package in R to predict the distribution of certain species using an ensemble of regression-based and machine-learning models. The models' performance was tested using cross-validation and the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) index. Additionally, the context discusses the use of climate scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to project the species' range shifts. However, there is no mention of a deep learning model or the platform it was deployed on.
