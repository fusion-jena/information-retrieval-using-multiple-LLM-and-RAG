Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the models is evaluated using image datasets with input and target image pairs, where the input image describes the image that is supposed to be classified and the target image describes the corresponding classes (labels). For semantic image segmentation, the target image consists of a fully labeled image, which means that every single pixel of the training image is assigned to a certain class. In some cases, parts of the image that have no influence on the specific task can be ignored by the model, which can be done by adjusting the loss.

Moreover, the context mentions that the JEM image classification model allows out of distribution detection and better calibration of the model, which suggests that the model performance is being monitored during training to ensure that it can detect images that are different from the training data and that the model's confidence in its predictions is appropriate.

The authors also mention that the JEM model was trained with unlabeled data during the training process, which helped reduce the time needed for manual data labeling. This suggests that the model's performance was monitored during training to ensure that it was benefiting from the unlabeled data.

Furthermore, the authors compare the JEM model's performance to a basic model and state that the JEM model's training was very stable, whereas the basic model's training was unstable. This comparison suggests that the model performance was monitored during training to ensure that the training process was stable and that the model was not overfitting or underfitting the training data.

Overall, while the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not mentioned, it can be inferred that the performance of the models is evaluated using image datasets, and that the training process is monitored to ensure that the model is benefiting from unlabeled data, detecting out of distribution images, and that the training process is stable.
