Answer:::
Unfortunately, the context provided does not give information about the specific location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the availability of public code examples for accessible platforms/frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, but it does not specify if the pipeline in question is available in any of those repositories. Commercial restrictions may also apply to the availability of the data used in this work, which could further limit the public availability of the code. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
