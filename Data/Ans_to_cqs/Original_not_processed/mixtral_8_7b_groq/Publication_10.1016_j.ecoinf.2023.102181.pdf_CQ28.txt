Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. There are no mentions of AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or any other cloud services that are often used to deploy deep learning models.

The context focuses on the methodology and evaluation of predictive models for environmental data, specifically in the fields of ecology, soil science, and marine habitat mapping. It discusses techniques for reducing bias in machine learning models trained with clustered data, visualizing model behavior, and spatial sampling for digital soil map validation.

There are references to various studies and resources, but none of them mention the deployment platform for the deep learning models.

An example of a study mentioned in the context is "Machine learning for predicting soil classes in three semi-arid landscapes" published in Geoderma. However, this study focuses on the methodology and evaluation of the machine learning models, and it does not provide information about the deployment platform.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
