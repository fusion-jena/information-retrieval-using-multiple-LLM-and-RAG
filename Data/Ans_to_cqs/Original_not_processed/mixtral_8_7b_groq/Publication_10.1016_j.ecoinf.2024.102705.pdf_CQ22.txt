Answer:::
The specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the given context are accuracy and percentage points of improvement.

The model's accuracy is calculated in comparison to another model, IA-YOLO, on two datasets. The first dataset shows an improvement of 1.35%, and the second dataset shows an improvement of 0.08%. This indicates that the proposed method, incorporating a compact network with a non-local layer, is more accurate than the comparison model in predicting parameters for image processing algorithms.

Additionally, the model with an added AIP module showed improvements of 1.47% and 2.27% compared to the YOLOv8s baseline model on both datasets, respectively. This demonstrates that the proposed AIP module can be flexibly applied to different baseline models and improve their performance in low-quality images.

However, other common metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score are not explicitly mentioned in the context. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. These metrics could also be used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
