Answer:::

In the context provided, the specific data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the annotation process involves marking the plant organs in the herbarium scans, which is a form of object detection.

Object detection is a computer vision task that involves detecting instances of objects of a certain class in an image and determining their location. This is typically done by drawing bounding boxes around the objects in the image. In the context of the study, the bounding boxes would likely be used to mark the plant organs such as leaves, stems, and flowers in the herbarium scans.

Another data annotation technique that could be used in a deep learning pipeline is instance segmentation. Instance segmentation is a more fine-grained version of object detection, where the object instances are not only localized with bounding boxes, but also the pixels belonging to each instance are segmented out. This can provide more precise information about the shape and size of the objects, but it is also a more complex and computationally intensive task.

The study mentions that they used a deep learning method called Faster R-CNN (Ren et al. 2015) for training the model. Faster R-CNN is a region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) that is used for object detection. It first generates region proposals and then classifies these regions and refines the bounding boxes. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data annotation technique used in this study is bounding box annotation for object detection.
