Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does mention that the performance of an unspecified model was evaluated using the leave-one-out procedure for cross-validation, and several metrics were calculated for model performance. These metrics include the coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE).

The coefficient of determination (R2) is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of regression models, including deep learning models. It measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. An R2 value closer to 1 indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are also commonly used metrics for evaluating model performance. MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors, while RMSE measures the standard deviation of the prediction errors. A lower value for both MAE and RMSE indicates better model performance.

Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE) is a normalized version of RMSE, which allows for comparison of models across different datasets. It is calculated by dividing RMSE by the range of the dependent variable. A lower value for RRMSE indicates better model performance.

However, the context does not mention any metrics specific to deep learning models, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions, while precision measures the proportion of true positives out of all positive predictions. Recall measures the proportion of true positives out of all actual positives. These metrics are commonly used for evaluating classification models, but they may not be applicable to all deep learning models, especially those used for regression tasks.

Therefore, while the context provides some insight into the metrics used for evaluating model performance, it does not explicitly answer the query regarding the metrics used for deep learning models.
