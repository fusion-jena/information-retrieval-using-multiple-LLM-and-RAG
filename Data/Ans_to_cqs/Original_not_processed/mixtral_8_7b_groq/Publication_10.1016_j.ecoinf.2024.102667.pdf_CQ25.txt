Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the use of a deep learning model in any of the studies mentioned. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively state the purpose of the deep learning model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection) in this case.

However, we can infer that some of the studies used machine learning techniques for data analysis. For instance, the study by Su et al. (2023) explored the unintended consequences of combating desertification in China, and they might have used machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling or data analysis. Similarly, the study by Wei et al. (2022) assessed the lagged and cumulative effects of drought on grassland gross primary production, and they could have employed machine learning models for data processing or analysis.

In the study by Wu et al. (2015), the authors investigated time-lag effects of global vegetation responses to climate change. While they did not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models, they did use statistical methods and time-series analysis, which could involve machine learning techniques.

In summary, while the provided context does not give a clear answer regarding the purpose of a deep learning model, it is evident that some of the studies used machine learning techniques for data analysis. Nonetheless, it is not possible to determine the specific purpose of the deep learning model (classification, segmentation, detection) without additional information.
