Answer:::
The specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models mentioned in the context are not provided. However, based on common practice in machine learning and the nature of the task, it is likely that metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used.

Accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made. Precision is the proportion of true positives (correctly predicted positive instances) among all positive predictions. Recall is the proportion of true positives among all actual positive instances. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.

In the context of the study, the deep learning models are used for image classification tasks, where the goal is to correctly identify the class (stained or unstained, clubmoss or spikemoss) of a given image. These metrics are commonly used to assess the performance of image classification models.

Annotated notebooks (suppl. material 2 and 4) and the use of a test dataset (10% of the images) suggest that the authors took steps to evaluate their models systematically. However, without explicit information on the metrics used, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.
