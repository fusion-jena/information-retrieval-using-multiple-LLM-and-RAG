The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the pipeline involves running a pre-trained detector model on images and then learning an embedding model on a large dataset. After that, the embedding model is used to embed crops from a target dataset into a 256-dimensional feature space. The pipeline is then validated against the NACTI dataset.

The NACTI dataset is a camera trap image dataset used for species classification, and it is likely that the target dataset used in the pipeline is also a camera trap image dataset. The large dataset used for training the embedding model is not specified, but it is mentioned that transfer learning is used, which suggests that it is a large and relevant dataset for learning general features.

In summary, while the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned, it is likely that they include a large dataset for training the embedding model, a target dataset of camera trap images, and the NACTI dataset for validation.
