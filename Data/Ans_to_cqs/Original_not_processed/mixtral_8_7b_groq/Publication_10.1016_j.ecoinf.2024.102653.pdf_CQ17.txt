Answer:::
The regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. In the proposed architecture, the model employs dual BiLSTM layers in its structure. Following each BiLSTM layer, dropout regularization is incorporated. This regularization method entails the random deactivation of 50% of the neural connections, which helps in mitigating the risk of overfitting.

L2 regularization is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model primarily uses dropout as the regularization technique.

Another approach to prevent overfitting is the use of a densely connected layer with 128 neurons, which utilizes a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. This layer further helps in reducing overfitting by introducing non-linearity and reducing the complexity of the model.

In addition, the model harnessed the capabilities of the NVIDIA CUDA Deep Neural Network (cuDNN) library to enhance computational efficiency and reduce training duration. This library can also help in preventing overfitting by providing optimized and efficient implementations of various deep learning algorithms.

Overall, the model uses dropout as the primary regularization technique to prevent overfitting, along with other approaches such as the use of a Rectified Linear Unit activation function and the NVIDIA CUDA Deep Neural Network library.
