Answer:::
The provided context discusses the use of GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning in both deep learning and traditional machine learning models, but it does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters tuned in the deep learning models. However, it does allude to some parameters that are generally applicable to many models, including deep learning ones.

For instance, the context mentions 'max_depth' in tree-based models and 'learning_rate' in boosting models. While tree-based models are not deep learning models per se, 'max_depth' is a parameter that can be found in some deep learning models like decision trees or random forests. 'Learning_rate', on the other hand, is a common hyperparameter in many models, including deep learning ones, where it controls the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function.

Moreover, the number of estimators or iterations is another crucial parameter for model optimization, as stated in the context. This parameter is also relevant in deep learning models, where it can control the number of times the model weights are updated.

As for the specific hyperparameters like optimizers (e.g., Adam, RMSprop) that are often associated with deep learning models, the context does not provide enough information to answer this part of the query. Therefore, without further information, I cannot provide a definitive list of hyperparameters used in the deep learning models.
