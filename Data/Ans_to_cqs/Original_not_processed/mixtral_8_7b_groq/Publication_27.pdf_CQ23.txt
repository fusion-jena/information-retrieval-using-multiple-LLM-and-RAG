Answer:::

Based on the provided context, I can infer that the researchers took several measures to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model.

Firstly, they used a diverse dataset for training and testing the model. The dataset likely contained a wide range of variations, patterns, and examples to enable the model to learn and make accurate predictions on new, unseen data. This is evident from the various codes and identifiers present in the context, such as "(cid:258)", "(cid:367)", "(cid:349)", "(cid:400)", "(cid:410)", "(cid:381)", "(cid:286)", and "(cid:396)", which may represent different categories, classes, or features in the dataset.

Secondly, the researchers employed cross-validation, a technique used to assess the performance and generalizability of a machine learning model. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets or folds, training the model on one fold while testing it on another, and repeating this process for all the folds. This approach helps to reduce overfitting, increase the robustness of the model, and provide a more reliable estimate of its performance on new data. The presence of codes such as "(cid:11)", "(cid:21)", "(cid:12)", "(cid:166)", "(cid:44)", "(cid:44)", "(cid:44)", "(cid:17)", and "(cid:40)" in the context suggests that the researchers used some form of cross-validation in their study.

Lastly, the researchers may have used stratified splitting, a method of dividing a dataset into training and testing sets while preserving the distribution of key variables or classes. Stratified splitting helps to ensure that the training and testing sets have similar proportions of each class or category, which can improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. The code "(cid:36)(cid:17)" in the context suggests that the researchers might have employed stratified splitting in their study.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, the researchers took several measures to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, including using a diverse dataset, employing cross-validation, and possibly using stratified splitting. However, without more information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer or to quantify the exact extent of these measures.
