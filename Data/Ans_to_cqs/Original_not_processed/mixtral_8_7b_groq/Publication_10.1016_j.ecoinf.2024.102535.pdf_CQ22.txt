Answer:::

The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using the F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Precision (Pc) is the number of true positives (tp) divided by the sum of true positives and false positives (fp). Recall (Rc) is the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives (fn). The F1-score is calculated as the formula: F1 scorec = 2 × Pc × Rc / (Pc + Rc). This metric is used to assess the performance of the models in the problem of deep-sea substratum characterization. The F1-scores are averaged across the testing folds to express the performance of the classifiers in all experiments. Additionally, the models are evaluated using accuracy metrics, but the specific values are not reported in the provided context.
