Answer:::

Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to enhance the quality of data and improve the model's performance. These steps include normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

Normalization is a process that changes the range of input variables so that they have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This is important because deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are sensitive to the scale of input features. In the context of LULC classification using CNNs, normalization ensures that all spectral bands in the raster bands stack have the same scale, allowing the model to learn from them equally.

Scaling is another preprocessing step that involves resizing the input data to a specific size. In the context of CNNs, scaling is necessary because the convolution operation requires input data of a fixed size. For LULC classification, the raster bands stack is scaled to the required size of the input layer of the CNN.

Cleaning is the process of removing noise, outliers, and missing values from the input data. In the context of LULC classification, cleaning is essential because the quality of satellite images can be affected by atmospheric conditions, sensor noise, and other factors that can introduce errors in the spectral signatures of land cover forms. Cleaning the raster bands stack ensures that the input data is of high quality and free from errors that can negatively impact the performance of the CNN.

In summary, before training a deep learning model like a CNN for LULC classification, it is essential to normalize, scale, and clean the input data. These preprocessing steps ensure that the input data is of high quality, has the same scale, and is free from errors, allowing the CNN to learn from the data effectively and accurately classify land cover forms based on their spectral signatures.
