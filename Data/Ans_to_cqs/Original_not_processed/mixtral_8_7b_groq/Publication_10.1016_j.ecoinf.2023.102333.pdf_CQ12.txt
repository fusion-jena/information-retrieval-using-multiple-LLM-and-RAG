Answer:::
The pieces of context provided do not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, they do mention the optimization of DNN (Deep Neural Network) architectures. Therefore, it can be inferred that a DNN model is used in the pipeline. The context discusses optimizing hyperparameters related to the model's architecture, such as the number of layers and nodes, activation functions, regularization, and optimization algorithms. These are all common adjustable parameters in a DNN model. The optimization process considers the model's accuracy, computation time and costs, and the impact of each hyperparameter on the model's performance. Therefore, based on the provided context, a DNN model is used in the pipeline.

An optimization algorithm was executed to find the highest accuracy from 1,788,160 hyperparameter combinations for the DNN model. Three DNN architectures were then built and trained for the entire dataset for 1000 epochs. The context also mentions recent studies evaluating techniques for tuning hyperparameters, such as network structure, activation functions, and regularization, which are all relevant to DNN models.

However, the context does not mention any other deep learning models such as CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), or Transformer. Therefore, it can be concluded that a DNN model is used in the pipeline.
