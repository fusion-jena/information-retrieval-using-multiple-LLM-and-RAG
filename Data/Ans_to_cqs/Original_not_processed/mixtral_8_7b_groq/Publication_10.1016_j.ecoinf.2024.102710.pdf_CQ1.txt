Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific details about how the raw data is collected for the deep learning pipeline. It mainly focuses on the methods used for processing and annotating the data, rather than the data collection itself. However, it can be inferred that the raw data used in this study is related to passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of ecological phenomena, as the main goal of the study is to accelerate the annotation of species-level sound events in PAM datasets.

Passive acoustic monitoring typically involves the use of sensors, such as hydrophones or microphones, to record sounds in a specific environment over a period of time. These sounds can then be analyzed to identify and classify different species or events of interest. The data used in this study likely comes from such sensors, although the specific details of the data collection process are not provided.

Additionally, the authors mention using three different datasets in their study, but there is no information on where these datasets come from or how they were collected. They could have been collected by the authors themselves, or they could be publicly available datasets.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about how the raw data is collected for the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that the data is related to passive acoustic monitoring and likely involves the use of sensors to record sounds in a specific environment.
