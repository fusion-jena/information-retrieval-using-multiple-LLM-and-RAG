The provided context does not include information about the specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide a general overview of some common data annotation techniques used for computer vision tasks, which are often a part of deep learning pipelines.

Data annotation is the process of labeling data so that machine learning algorithms can learn to make predictions or classifications based on that data. In the context of computer vision, data annotation typically involves labeling images or video frames with information that helps the model understand the content. Some common data annotation techniques include:

1. **Bounding box annotation**: This technique involves drawing a bounding box around an object of interest in an image. The bounding box typically has two coordinates (x, y) for the top-left corner and two coordinates (w, h) for the width and height. This technique is often used for object detection tasks, where the goal is to identify the location and class of objects within an image.
2. **Semantic segmentation**: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class label. This can be thought of as a more granular version of bounding box annotation, where instead of labeling a bounding box around an object, each individual pixel is labeled. Semantic segmentation is often used for scene understanding tasks, where the goal is to identify different regions or objects within an image.
3. **Instance segmentation**: This technique is similar to semantic segmentation, but it also distinguishes between individual instances of an object. For example, if there are multiple cars in an image, instance segmentation would label each car with a unique instance ID. This technique is often used for tasks where it's important to distinguish between individual objects, such as object tracking or counting.
4. **Keypoint annotation**: This technique involves labeling specific points or "keypoints" on an object. For example, in a human pose estimation task, keypoints might include the joints of the body (e.g., elbows, wrists, knees). Keypoint annotation is often used for tasks where the goal is to understand the spatial configuration of an object or scene.

It's worth noting that the specific data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline will depend on the task at hand, as well as the data available. In some cases, it may be possible to use pre-existing datasets with pre-labeled data, while in other cases it may be necessary to manually annotate data. Additionally, there are a variety of tools and software available for data annotation, ranging from open-source tools like Labelbox and VGG Image Annotator (VIA) to commercial tools like Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth.
