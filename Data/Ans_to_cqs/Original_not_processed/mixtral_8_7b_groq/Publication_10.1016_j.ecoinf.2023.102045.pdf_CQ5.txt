The provided context does not include information about the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the importance of color-blind friendly color ramps in ecological informatics and mapping, but it does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning context.

In general, the datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines for image classification tasks include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet.

* MNIST: a dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used as a starting point for image classification tasks. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, all of which are 28x28 grayscale images.
* CIFAR: a dataset of natural images, commonly used for object recognition tasks. It contains 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, all of which are 32x32 color images. There are two versions of the dataset, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, which contain 10 and 100 classes, respectively.
* ImageNet: a large-scale dataset of natural images, commonly used for object recognition tasks. It contains over 14 million images, all of which are annotated with one of 21,841 classes.

It's important to note that these datasets are not specific to ecological informatics or mapping, but are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for image classification tasks.
