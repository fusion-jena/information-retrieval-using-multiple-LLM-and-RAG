Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling that were applied in the specific deep learning pipelines discussed in the articles. However, data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning, particularly in image processing, to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset and improve model performance.

Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling involve creating new training samples by applying transformations to the existing samples. For example, flipping involves horizontally or vertically flipping an image, rotating involves rotating an image by a certain angle, and scaling involves changing the size of an image. These techniques can help the model generalize better and reduce overfitting by providing additional variations of the training data.

In the context of remote sensing and image processing, data augmentation techniques can be particularly useful for handling issues such as varying image orientations, scales, and lighting conditions. For instance, in the article by Li et al. (2020), the authors used generative adversarial networks (GANs) and a physical model of cloud distortion to remove thin clouds from optical remote sensing images. While the specific data augmentation techniques used in this study are not mentioned, it is possible that they employed techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling to augment the training data and improve the model's ability to handle variations in cloud patterns and image orientations.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines discussed in the articles, techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning, particularly in image processing and remote sensing. These techniques can help improve model performance and generalization by providing additional variations of the training data.
