Answer:::

The context does not provide explicit information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the models mentioned. However, it can be inferred that one common method for determining training completion is when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly. This is a common practice in machine learning model training, where the model is trained until the performance on a validation set stops improving or shows only minor improvements. This helps to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on unseen data.

Additionally, the context states that the models are trained using the ADAM optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-3, and that the training samples are selected randomly from the first group, with a data distribution of 70.12% for training, 1.69% validation, and 28.19% for testing. This suggests that the models are likely being trained using an implementation of early stopping, where training is halted when the validation loss does not improve for a certain number of epochs.

It's also worth noting that the context provides the accuracy of the models on the train, validation, and test sets, both for raw and pre-processed data. This information can be used to determine if the model is overfitting or underfitting. If the training accuracy is much higher than the validation accuracy, it suggests that the model is overfitting. If the training accuracy is much lower than the validation accuracy, it suggests that the model is underfitting.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on the criteria used to determine training completion, it can be inferred that the models are likely being trained using a method such as early stopping, where training is halted when the validation loss does not improve for a certain number of epochs. Additionally, the provided accuracy information can be used to determine if the model is overfitting or underfitting.
