Answer:::
In the first scenario, the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) training is carried out on a workstation with an AMD Threadripper Pro 3955WX processor, which has 32 GB of RAM, and a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) NVIDIA Quadro P620. The training of the CNN is executed using a Python application that the final user (biologist) utilizes to order new trainings of the CNNs and new updates of the trained CNNs on the physical nodes or their digital twins for simulations or cooperative classifications. The communication between the cyber and the physical system is established using the TCP/IP protocol.

In contrast, the second scenario employs a different platform for the testbeds, which is based on the System of Chip (SoC) BCM2835. This platform includes a microprocessor ARM1176JZF-S at 700 MHz, which can reach 1 GHz using overclocking, and a GPU VideoCore IV. However, in this case, both the pre-processing of the audio signal and the execution of the CNN are carried out by the CPU using a TensorFlow Lite library. The communications are implemented using a LoRaÂ® with a data rate of around 5kbps using a spread factor of 7 and a bandwidth of 125 kHz. Nodes are provided with a weatherproof microphone and a solar cell for an autonomous power supply.

Therefore, the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model in the first scenario are a GPU (NVIDIA Quadro P620) and a CPU (AMD Threadripper Pro 3955WX), while in the second scenario, only the CPU (ARM1176JZF-S) is used for training the deep learning model.
