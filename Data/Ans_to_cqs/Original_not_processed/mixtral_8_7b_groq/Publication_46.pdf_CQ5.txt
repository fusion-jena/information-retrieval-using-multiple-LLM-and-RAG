Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for this study are not explicitly mentioned. The study focuses on establishing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and testing its performance in Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) for the plant species Rhododendron arboreum in the foothills of the Himalayas. The input data for the CNN model includes occurrence data for the target species and several ecological and bioclimatic satellite-based observations. However, the context does not provide information on whether any standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet were used in this study. It is possible that the authors used custom datasets specific to their study area and target species.
