Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific details about how the trained deep learning model was deployed. However, it does mention that deep learning strategies, including neural networks, were used in ecological modeling (Cazau et al., 2023). The majority of model results consisted of species spatial predictions (82%), while 12% were species spatial projections, and 12% were conducted solely for descriptive purposes.

In general, deploying a deep learning model involves several steps after training the model. First, the model is usually saved or serialized to disk so that it can be loaded and used in other applications. This is because deep learning models can be quite large and complex, and it is more efficient to load a pre-trained model than to retrain it each time.

Once the model is serialized, it can be loaded into a variety of platforms for deployment. For example, the model could be deployed on a local machine for batch processing, or it could be deployed on a cloud platform for real-time inference. The choice of platform depends on the specific use case and the resources available.

In addition to serialization and platform selection, there are other considerations for deploying deep learning models. For example, it is important to ensure that the model is compatible with the input data format and that the model's predictions are accurate and reliable. It is also important to consider the ethical and social implications of using the model, particularly if it is being used to make decisions that affect people or the environment.

Overall, while the provided context does not give specific details about how the trained deep learning model was deployed, it is clear that deep learning strategies are being used in ecological modeling and that the majority of model results are species spatial predictions. Deploying a deep learning model involves several steps, including serialization and platform selection, and it is important to ensure that the model is accurate, reliable, and ethically sound.
