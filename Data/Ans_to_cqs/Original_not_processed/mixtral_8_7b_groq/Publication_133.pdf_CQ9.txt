Answer:::
The specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Gerovichev et al. is not mentioned in the provided article. They do mention using data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) Home Page1, but it is not clear if this is where the data and code for their deep learning pipeline are stored. Researchers often use different repositories for data and code, and it is possible that the data and code for this study are stored in separate locations.

It is a good practice for researchers to provide information about data and code repositories in their publications to promote transparency and reproducibility. However, this information might not always be included in the main text of the article. Therefore, it is also recommended to check the supplementary materials or the GitHub profile of the authors for additional information.

In summary, while the data repository for the study by Gerovichev et al. is not explicitly mentioned in the provided article, it is possible that the data is available on the GBIF Home Page. The code repository, if separate, is not identified. It is recommended to check the supplementary materials or the GitHub profile of the authors for additional information.
