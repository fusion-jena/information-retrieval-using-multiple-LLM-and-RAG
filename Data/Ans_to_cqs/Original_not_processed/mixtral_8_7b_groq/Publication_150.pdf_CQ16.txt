Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It mentions that models were trained for 150 epochs, but it does not specify whether training was stopped because of a validation loss plateau or for some other reason.

In general, training of machine learning models is often stopped when the performance on a validation set stops improving or when the validation loss plateaus. This is done to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on new, unseen data. Monitoring the validation loss during training helps to ensure that the model is learning to generalize well to new data.

In the context of the study, it is possible that the authors used a similar approach and stopped training when the validation loss plateaued. However, without explicit information on this, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.

Another possible reason for stopping training after 150 epochs could be computational constraints. Training deep learning models can be computationally intensive and time-consuming, and it is possible that the authors had a limited amount of computational resources available. In such cases, training is often stopped after a predetermined number of epochs, regardless of whether the validation loss has plateaued or not.

In summary, while the context provided does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, it is possible that the authors used a validation loss plateau or computational constraints as the stopping criterion.
