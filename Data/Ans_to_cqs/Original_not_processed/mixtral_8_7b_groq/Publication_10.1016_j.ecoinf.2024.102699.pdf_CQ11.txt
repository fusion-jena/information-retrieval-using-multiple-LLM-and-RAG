Answer:::
I am unable to provide the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the provided context. The context includes detailed information about the models, architectures, and augmentation strategies used in the pipeline, but it does not mention where the data used in the pipeline can be found or accessed. Therefore, I would recommend looking at the original source of the information provided or contacting the authors for more information on where to find the data.
