The context provided does not give information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the use of different convolutional neural network models for image classification and regression tasks, such as ResNet-50, Inception-V3, and ViT. It also mentions the use of the HuggingFace and Keras libraries for implementing these models and specifies some details about the training process, such as the batch size, learning rate, and optimizer used. However, there is no information about the deployment of the models on a cloud platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
