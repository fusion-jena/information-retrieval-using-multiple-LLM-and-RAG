Answer:::

The hyperparameters of machine learning models are often optimized using techniques such as grid search and random search. Grid search involves systematically trying out different combinations of hyperparameter values within a predefined range or set of options (Probst et al., 2019; Ryu et al., 2020). For instance, when tuning a Random Forest model, the number of trees (ntree) and the number of variables sampled at each split (mtry) can be optimized using grid search (Freeman et al., 2016b; Luo et al., 2024). Similarly, for XGBoost, parameters like the number of boosting iterations (nrounds), maximum depth, min child weight, gamma, and subsample can be tuned using grid search (Gertz et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2024; Mehmood et al., 2024a).

On the other hand, random search is a more efficient alternative to grid search, where a random combination of hyperparameters is sampled within a given range for each iteration (Bergstra & Bengio, 2012). Random search has been found to perform better than grid search in many scenarios, as it explores the hyperparameter space more efficiently and can find good models faster (Bergstra & Bengio, 2012).

In the context of the provided articles, grid search is explicitly mentioned as a method for hyperparameter optimization in Random Forest and XGBoost models (Freeman et al., 2016b; Luo et al., 2024; Probst et al., 2019; Gertz et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023; Mehmood et al., 2024a; Ryu et al., 2020). However, random search is not explicitly mentioned. Nonetheless, both techniques are commonly used for hyperparameter optimization in machine learning.
