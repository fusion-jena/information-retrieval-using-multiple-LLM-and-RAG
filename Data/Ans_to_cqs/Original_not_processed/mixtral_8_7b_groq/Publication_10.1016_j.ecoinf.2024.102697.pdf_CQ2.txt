The provided pieces of context do not directly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do give some insight into the types of data that can be used with machine learning techniques.

Machine learning methods, including deep learning, can integrate diverse data streams (Zhang et al., 2023; Zheng and Jia, 2022). In the context of Zhang et al. (2023), the data used is related to water quality indicators of wastewater treatment plant influent. Although the specific data format is not mentioned, it is likely that the data is presented in a structured format, such as a CSV file, containing various water quality parameters.

Zheng and Jia (2022) evaluate different methods for soil heat flux estimation at large scales using remote sensing observations. Remote sensing data typically come in the form of raster images (e.g., satellite or aerial imagery), which can be processed and analyzed using machine learning techniques.

Baret and Buis (2008), Bonsoms and Boulet (2022), Chan and Paelinckx (2008), and Maxwell et al. (2018) have all applied random forest models in various remote sensing applications, which further supports the use of raster image data in machine learning pipelines.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that structured data formats, such as CSV files, and raster image data from remote sensing observations are commonly used in machine learning applications.
