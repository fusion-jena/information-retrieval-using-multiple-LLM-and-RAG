Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does provide some context about the data sources and the construction of the provincial-scale fitting models.

The data used in this study includes nighttime lighting data, provincial statistical energy data, municipal statistical data, and carbon emission factors for various energy sources. These data are used to calculate the CO2 emissions for different energy sources, which are then classified into nine categories.

In the construction of the provincial-scale fitting models, the authors used a methodology that involves the use of software, methodology, and data curation. The authors also used a conceptualization and funding acquisition, as well as writing - review & editing, methodology, and writing - original draft.

In general, when splitting data for deep learning model training, it is common to use a portion of the data for training the model, another portion for testing the model, and a final portion for validating the model. The exact criteria for splitting the data can vary depending on the specific use case and the size of the dataset. Common approaches include randomly splitting the data into training, testing, and validation sets, or using a technique such as k-fold cross-validation.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it does provide some context about the data sources and the construction of the provincial-scale fitting models. The criteria for splitting the data can vary depending on the specific use case and the size of the dataset.
