Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific deep learning model, its architecture, or the hyperparameters used such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context focuses on the use of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data and the Jenks natural breaks optimization method for classification analysis. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query regarding the hyperparameters of a deep learning model.
