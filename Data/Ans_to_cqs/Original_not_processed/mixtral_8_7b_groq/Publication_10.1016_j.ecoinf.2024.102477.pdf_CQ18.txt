Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the training results of the hyperparameter-optimized Support Vector Regression (SVR) model are presented in Table 2, which suggests that the model performance was evaluated during the training process.

The SVR model's performance is evaluated using two metrics: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The MAPE values of the SVR model are compared with those of other models, including ARIMA, SARIMA, ETS, HWETS, SLSTM, and SGRU. The lower MAPE values of the SVR model indicate that its predictive performance is better than some of the other models.

Moreover, the context mentions that the SVR model's hyperparameters, C and ε, are optimized during the training process. The parameter C controls error tolerance during training and determines the maximum deviation that the model permits for any individual training example. A higher C value allows for a larger error, which makes the model more likely to fit the training data but also increases the risk of overfitting. Conversely, a smaller C value imposes stricter constraints on the model, thereby increasing the difficulty of fitting the training data but potentially reducing overfitting.

Similarly, the parameter ε controls the model's fault tolerance, that is, the degree of tolerance for differences between predicted and actual values of training samples. A smaller ε value imposes stricter constraints on the model, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting but potentially increasing the risk of underfitting.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the model performance during training is monitored by evaluating the model's predictive performance using MAPE and RMSE metrics and optimizing the hyperparameters C and ε to prevent overfitting and underfitting.
