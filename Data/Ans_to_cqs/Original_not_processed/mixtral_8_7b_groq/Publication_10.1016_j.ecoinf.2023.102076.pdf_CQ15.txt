Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline described in the context uses the Adam optimization technique during the training of the architecture. Specifically, the whole architecture, which includes the base model and the linear classification layer, is fine-tuned using Adam optimization.

Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is a popular optimization algorithm used in training deep learning models. It is an extension of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method, which is a first-order optimization algorithm used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient.

Adam combines the benefits of two other optimization methods, AdaGrad and RMSProp, to provide an optimization algorithm that can handle sparse gradients and non-stationary problems. Adam has been found to be efficient in various deep learning tasks, and it is known for its ability to adaptively adjust the learning rate for each parameter.

In contrast, the feature-based approach, which involves feeding text representations obtained from BERT into another model, is less computationally expensive but has shown to have inferior performance compared to fine-tuning of BERT architecture.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline utilizes Adam optimization to fine-tune the BERT architecture, which has been shown to improve performance over feature-based approaches.
