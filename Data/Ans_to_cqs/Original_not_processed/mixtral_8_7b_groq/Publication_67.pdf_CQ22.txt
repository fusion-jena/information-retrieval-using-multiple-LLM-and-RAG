Answer:::

The performance of deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, is evaluated using various metrics. In the context provided, the authors used precision, recall, and F1-measure to evaluate the performance of CNN-based models for classifying tree cover.

Precision is calculated as the true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives. It represents the proportion of correctly classified instances out of all instances classified by the model as belonging to a certain class. High precision indicates that the model has a low false positive rate, meaning it returns substantially better tree cover classes.

Recall, on the other hand, is calculated as the true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives. It represents the proportion of correctly classified instances out of all instances that actually belong to a certain class. High recall indicates that the model has a low false negative rate, meaning it returns most of the actual tree cover.

The F1-measure provides a balance between precision and recall, calculated as 2 × Precision × Recall / (Precision + Recall). It represents the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that encapsulates both.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the CNN-based models in classifying tree cover into three categories: Open Forest (tree cover 10-40%), Closed Forest (tree cover 41-65%), and Dense Forest (tree cover 66-100%). The authors found that increasing the size of the training dataset improved model performance, and the most accurate CNN-based model was obtained without the Non-Forest auxiliary class, using continuous tree cover classes, and a larger number of training samples. This model reached the highest F1-measure for Open Forest and Dense Forest, 71% and 79%, respectively.

Therefore, in the context provided, the authors used precision, recall, and F1-measure to evaluate the performance of CNN-based models for classifying tree cover.
