The criteria used to split data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation datasets, are not specified in the provided context. However, the context does suggest some general principles and techniques for data preparation and model training that could be applied when selecting a split strategy.

In the context of a study on estimating soil moisture using remote sensing data and topographic indices, the authors suggest testing more advanced methods of data analysis, including machine learning and deep neural networks, to increase the accuracy of prediction. When implementing these methods, it is common to split the dataset into separate subsets for training, testing, and validation.

The train dataset is used to train the model by adjusting the model parameters to minimize the error between the predicted and actual values. The test dataset is then used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. This helps to assess the model's ability to generalize to new data and to identify any overfitting that may have occurred during training.

The validation dataset is used to tune the model's hyperparameters, which are the parameters that are set before training and are not adjusted during the training process. Examples of hyperparameters include the learning rate, the number of hidden layers, and the number of neurons in each layer. The validation dataset is used to evaluate the model's performance on a separate subset of the data, allowing for the optimization of hyperparameters without affecting the performance on the test dataset.

There are various strategies for splitting the data into train, test, and validation datasets. One common approach is to use a random split, where a fixed percentage of the data is randomly assigned to each subset. Another approach is to use k-fold cross-validation, where the data is divided into k subsets, and the model is trained and tested k times, with each subset used as the validation set once.

In summary, while the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not provided in the context, it is common to use a train-test-validation split strategy. The train dataset is used for model training, the test dataset is used for model evaluation, and the validation dataset is used for hyperparameter tuning. The choice of split strategy depends on the specific problem and dataset, and various approaches, such as random split and k-fold cross-validation, can be used.
