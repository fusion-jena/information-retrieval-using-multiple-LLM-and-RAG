Answer:::

The text provided does not give a detailed explanation of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention some strategies that can contribute to the model's ability to generalize, such as the use of a diverse dataset and the separation of the training data into training and validation groups.

The dataset used in the study is obtained from the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency, which suggests that it is a real-world dataset with a high level of diversity. The authors also mention that they compared the deep learning model to machine learning models and a statistical predictive model, which could have helped to ensure that the deep learning model is able to generalize to different types of data and models.

In addition, the text mentions the use of the early stopping strategy, which is a technique used to cease training when generalization performance starts to degrade for a number of epochs. This can help to prevent overfitting, which is a common problem that can negatively impact a model's ability to generalize.

Furthermore, the authors mention the use of dropout, which is a regularization strategy that allows training of neural networks with alternative topologies in parallel by randomly dropping out a certain proportion of layer neurons. This can help to prevent overfitting by introducing some variability into the model during training.

Overall, while the text does not provide a detailed explanation of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it does mention some strategies that can contribute to the model's ability to generalize, such as the use of a diverse dataset, early stopping, and dropout.
