The context provided does not give specific information about the deep learning frameworks used to build the mentioned models (LeNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG-19, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNet152, ICSNet, and ICSNet_n). However, it is worth noting that TensorFlow and PyTorch are two of the most popular deep learning frameworks today. TensorFlow is a powerful library for numerical computation, particularly well-suited for large-scale Machine Learning. It was developed by the Google Brain team and is now widely used in both industry and academia. PyTorch, on the other hand, is a Machine Learning library based on the Torch library, which was initially developed for computer vision and NLP applications. It has gained popularity due to its simplicity and ease of use, as well as its seamless transition between CPUs and GPUs.

Considering that the provided context is from a scientific publication, it is highly probable that either TensorFlow or PyTorch (or even both) were used to build and test the models presented in the study. Nonetheless, without explicit information, it is impossible to give a definitive answer.
