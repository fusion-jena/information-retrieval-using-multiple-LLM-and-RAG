Answer:::

The deep learning model was implemented in PyTorch, and the training was carried out using the Adam optimizer, which is a variant of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) that adapts the magnitude of parameter updates based on the statistics of previous updates. This helps to speed up convergence.

The hyperparameters used in the model are as follows:

1. Learning rate (α): The base learning rate used was 10−4.
2. Batch size (B): The batch size used during training was 64.
3. Number of models (M): Five models were trained.
4. Weight decay: The strength of the unit Gaussian prior was controlled using weight decay, with a magnitude of 10−3.
5. Hyperparameters for the Adam optimizer: The hyperparameters used for the Adam optimizer were β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999, and ε = 10−8.
6. Learning rate reduction: The learning rate was automatically reduced by a factor of 0.1 when the validation loss did not improve for 15 consecutive epochs.
7. Training duration: Each neural network was trained for approximately 14 days on a single Nvidia RTX2080Ti GPU.

The loss function used in the model is a standard loss function whose minimization corresponds to maximizing the posterior probability of the parameters given the training data. A zero-mean isotropic Gaussian prior over the network parameters and a Gaussian likelihood function with a diagonal covariance matrix were assumed. The loss function is given by equation (1) in the context, which includes the regularization term and the data fitting term.
