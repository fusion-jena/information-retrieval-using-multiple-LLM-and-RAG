Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of performance metrics and the creation of confusion matrices.

For the classification task, the performance of the models was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. At each iteration of the cross-validation, one subset of the dataset was used to evaluate the models, while the remaining four subsets were used for training and validation. After training the models, the best performances were obtained in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and f1-score.

To regularize the model and minimize the loss function, an early stop approach was implemented with a patience value of 16. This technique prevents overfitting and conserves computational resources by halting the training process prematurely if performance on a validation dataset fails to improve beyond a predefined threshold.

After training and evaluating the models, performance metrics were calculated. The context mentions the f1-score, which is a harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a better measure of the incorrectly classified cases than the accuracy metric.

Additionally, confusion matrices were created to provide a more detailed analysis of the model's performance. A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It compares the actual values (ground truth) with the predicted values and shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

In the context provided, confusion matrices were created for the top-performing models, EfficientNetB0 and Inception-v3, to show the number of images displaying Cortaderia selloana that were confused with no C. selloana (false negatives) and the number of images showing no C. selloana that were incorrectly predicted as showing Cortaderia selloana (false positives).

Therefore, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of performance metrics, such as the f1-score, and the creation of confusion matrices.
