Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for monitoring ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that high-resolution remotely sensed imagery was used in the study.

The study by Huang et al. (2019) aimed to monitor ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen by using high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning. The authors developed a deep learning model to extract land-use types and further assess ecosystem services. However, they did not specify the exact name or source of the high-resolution remotely sensed imagery used in their study.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query regarding the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for this particular study. In future research, it would be helpful for authors to explicitly mention the datasets used in their deep learning pipelines to promote reproducibility and enable comparison with other studies.
