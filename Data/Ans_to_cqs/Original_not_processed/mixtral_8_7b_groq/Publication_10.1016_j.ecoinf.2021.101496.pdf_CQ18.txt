Answer:

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of both training and testing datasets in evaluating the performance of the three models - a simple linear model (LM), a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution (GLM), and an artificial neural network (ANN). The dataset, which contained 89 valid records, was divided into a "training dataset" with 60 randomly selected records and a "testing dataset" with the remaining 29 records. The models were then fitted using the "training dataset," and their performance was validated using the "testing dataset."

For the simple linear model (LM), the performance was monitored by calculating the R-squared value for the training data, which was 0.81. Additionally, the mean absolute difference for the test data was calculated, which was 1.85. These values provided an insight into how well the model was fitting the training data and how well it was able to predict the SPAD value for the test data.

Similarly, for the GLM model, the performance was monitored by calculating the artificial R-squared value for the training data, which was also 0.81. The mean absolute deviance of the testing data was calculated to be 1.79, indicating a slightly better performance compared to the LM model.

Lastly, for the ANN model, although it was considered during the testing stages due to the sensitivity of Cb and Cr variables, it was found that the addition of any hidden layers returned less accuracy in the prediction of the SPAD value on the test data due to overfitting. Therefore, the ANN model was not considered further in the source code.

In conclusion, the performance of the models was monitored using both the training and testing datasets, and the R-squared value, mean absolute difference, and mean absolute deviance were calculated to evaluate the models' performance. The LM model was concluded to be the simplest method with a high level of accuracy, and it was incorporated into the source code to provide the SPAD value estimate for the rapeseed measurements.
