Answer:::
The provided context does not include information about deep learning models or specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does describe the data preprocessing steps for a study involving human activity (HA) and natural endowment (NE) coupled zoning.

These preprocessing steps include:

1. Using the ArcGIS10.5 software, the spatial data was processed. This likely includes steps such as projecting the data to a common coordinate system, cropping or clipping the data to a region of interest, and potentially re-sampling the data to a common resolution.
2. The data sources listed in Table 1 were used. These include various demographic, land use, climate, and geographic data sources.
3. The data was quantified using various methods. For example, population density and economic density were calculated by dividing the population or economic value by the area of the region. Land use intensity was calculated by dividing the built-up area by the total area. Climatic conditions were quantified using precipitation, temperature, and evapotranspiration. Geographic conditions were quantified using elevation, slope, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Vegetation conditions were quantified using vegetation type and percentage.

It's important to note that these preprocessing steps are specific to the study and may not be applicable to all deep learning models. In general, preprocessing for deep learning models can include steps such as:

1. Normalization: scaling numerical data to a common range (e.g., 0-1) to improve model training and convergence.
2. Scaling: adjusting the range of features to improve model training and prevent certain features from dominating the model.
3. Cleaning: removing or correcting erroneous or missing data to improve model accuracy and prevent issues during training.

These steps are not mentioned in the provided context, but they are commonly used in deep learning model preprocessing.
