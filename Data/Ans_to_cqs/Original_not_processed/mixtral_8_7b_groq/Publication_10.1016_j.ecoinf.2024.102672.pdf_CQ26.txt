Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that a dataset was used, and a binary variable was added to it to indicate the existence of stratification in a reservoir. This variable took the value of 0 when the reservoir was not stratified and 1 when it was stratified.

The text also mentions that an unsupervised machine learning (ML) model was implemented to assist in determining the threshold of the thermal gradient to consider if the reservoir is stratified or not. This suggests that some preprocessing may have been done to determine the thermal gradient and create the binary variable. However, the techniques used to preprocess the data are not specified.

The techniques commonly used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified sampling involves dividing the data into subgroups or strata based on certain characteristics and then randomly selecting samples from each stratum to ensure that each subgroup is represented in the training and testing datasets. Oversampling involves increasing the number of samples from underrepresented subgroups to balance the dataset. Undersampling involves reducing the number of samples from overrepresented subgroups to balance the dataset. Diverse data collection involves gathering data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset includes a wide range of characteristics and subgroups.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it is possible that some preprocessing was done to create the binary variable used in the study. The common techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
