Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in the FIT model. The text does not mention any convergence criteria such as a validation loss plateau, accuracy threshold, or patience parameter that are commonly used in machine learning models to decide when to stop training.

In the FIT model, a customized model classifies animal trails using robust cross-validated discriminant analysis. The training set model is built using stepwise forward regression, and trails are mapped in two-dimensional space using the first two canonical variates. Centroid values and their respective 95% confidence ellipses are then plotted for each trail.

The methods used in the study include omitting missing values, mean imputation, and machine-learning-based techniques. However, the context does not provide details about the training process or the stopping criteria for the FIT model.

Another possibility is that the training process is not explicitly defined in the given text, and the model has been pre-trained or uses pre-computed values as part of its customized implementation. In this case, the stopping criteria would not be applicable or mentioned in the context.

In summary, there is no clear information in the provided context about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the FIT model. The text does not mention any convergence criteria such as a validation loss plateau, accuracy threshold, or patience parameter. The FIT model uses a customized implementation of robust cross-validated discriminant analysis, and the training process or stopping criteria might not be explicitly defined in the given text.
