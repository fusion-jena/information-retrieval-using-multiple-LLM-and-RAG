The pieces of context provided do not directly answer the query regarding regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. However, they do provide some insight into the broader field of machine learning and soil science.

To answer the query, dropout and L2 regularization are two common regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and less prone to overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, which can help to prevent overfitting.

In the context of soil science, machine learning techniques are used for various purposes, such as digital soil mapping, soil moisture estimation, and visualization of subsurface soil properties. For example, Jarray et al. (2022) developed a web-based tool for soil moisture estimation based on the Eo-Learn framework and machine learning methods. The tool aims to provide accurate and accessible soil moisture information to support decision-making in agriculture and environmental management.

The use of machine learning techniques in soil science requires careful consideration of the data and the modeling approach. As described in the overview and comparison of machine-learning techniques for classification purposes in digital soil mapping (Geoderma 265, 62â€“77), the choice of machine learning algorithm depends on various factors, such as the size and quality of the data, the complexity of the problem, and the computational resources available. Regularization methods, such as dropout and L2 regularization, can help to prevent overfitting and improve the performance of the model.

In summary, dropout and L2 regularization are two common regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. These techniques can be useful in the context of soil science, where machine learning techniques are used for various purposes, such as digital soil mapping, soil moisture estimation, and visualization of subsurface soil properties. The choice of machine learning algorithm and regularization method depends on various factors, such as the size and quality of the data, the complexity of the problem, and the computational resources available.
