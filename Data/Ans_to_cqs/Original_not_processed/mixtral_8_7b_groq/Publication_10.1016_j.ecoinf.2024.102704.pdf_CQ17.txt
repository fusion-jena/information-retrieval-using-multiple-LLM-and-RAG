The provided context does not directly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. However, it does discuss techniques for improving model performance and efficiency, such as reducing memory access and optimizing computation sequences.

In the context of deep learning, regularization methods are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data that may not generalize well to new, unseen data. Common regularization methods include L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping.

L1 and L2 regularization add a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to learn simpler, more generalizable patterns by reducing the magnitude of the weights. Dropout is a technique that randomly sets a fraction of the model's activations to zero during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of the weights. Early stopping is a technique that stops training when the model's performance on a validation set starts to degrade, which helps to prevent overfitting by stopping training before the model starts to learn overly complex patterns in the training data.

While the provided context does not directly mention these regularization methods, it does discuss techniques for improving model performance and efficiency that are complementary to regularization. For example, reducing memory access and optimizing computation sequences can help to improve the computational efficiency of the model, which can indirectly help to prevent overfitting by allowing the model to train for more epochs without running into computational or memory constraints.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models, it does discuss complementary techniques for improving model performance and efficiency. Regularization methods such as L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping can help to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, reducing the magnitude of the weights, preventing co-adaptation of the weights, and stopping training before the model starts to learn overly complex patterns in the training data.
