The text provided does not give specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the training data is divided into subsets and that high-level image classifiers are used to remove images that are not plants.

One common data augmentation technique in deep learning is indeed flipping, where an image is mirrored horizontally. This can help the model learn to recognize features that are symmetrical. Rotating the images is another common technique, which can help the model learn to recognize features regardless of their orientation. Scaling, or changing the size of the images, can help the model learn to recognize features at different scales. Other possible data augmentation techniques include cropping, translating (shifting the image horizontally or vertically), and changing the brightness, contrast, or hue of the images.

It is possible that some or all of these techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline described in the text. However, without more information, it is not possible to say for certain which data augmentation techniques were applied.
