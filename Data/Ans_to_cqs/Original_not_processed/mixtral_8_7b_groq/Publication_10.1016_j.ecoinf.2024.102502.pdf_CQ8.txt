Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. The context includes several papers and resources related to remote sensing, satellite data, and ecological processes. However, none of them mention a deep learning pipeline or its code repository on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

The papers by Pettorelli et al. (2014, 2018) discuss satellite remote sensing and its role in biodiversity research and conservation, as well as the opportunities and challenges of remote sensing for ecosystem functions. Remelgado et al. (2019) introduce an R package called 'rsmove' that bridges remote sensing and movement ecology. Roughgarden et al. (1991) discuss the role of remote sensing in ecology. The other references focus on remote sensing applications in agriculture, grasslands, and big data processing.

While these resources cover various aspects of remote sensing and ecology, none of them mention a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
