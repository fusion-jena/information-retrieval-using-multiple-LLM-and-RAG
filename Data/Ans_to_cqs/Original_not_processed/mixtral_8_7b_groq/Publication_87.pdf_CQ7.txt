Answer:::
In the provided context, the data splitting criteria for deep learning model training involve creating two datasets: a training set and a validation set. The training set is used to train the model, and the validation set is used to validate the model's performance.

The training set is created by filtering the data based on keywords, and then storing the corresponding images in a directory named 'train'. This is done using the following code:
```r
# training dataset
pix_train <- labels %>%
  group_by(Keywords) %>%
  filter(between(row_number(), floor(n()*20/100) + 1, n()))

# create dir train/ and copy pix there, organised by categories
dir.create('pix/train') # create training directory
for (i in levels(fct_drop(pix_train$Keywords))) dir.create(paste0('pix/train/',i)) # create dir for labels
for (i in 1:nrow(pix_train)){
  file.copy(as.character(pix_train$SourceFile[i]),
           paste0('pix/train/', as.character(pix_train$Keywords[i]))) # copy pix in corresp dir
}
```
The validation set is created by filtering the data based on keywords, and then storing the corresponding images in a directory named 'valid'. This is done using the following code:
```r
# validation dataset
pix_valid <- labels %>%
  group_by(Keywords) %>%
  filter(between(row_number(), floor(n()*80/100) + 1, n()))

# create dir valid/ and copy pix there, organised by categories.
dir.create('pix/valid') # create validation dir
for (i in levels(fct_drop(pix_train$Keywords))) dir.create(paste0('pix/valid/',i)) # create dir for labels
for (i in 1:nrow(pix_valid)){
  file.copy(as.character(pix_valid$SourceFile[i]),
           paste0('pix/valid/', as.character(pix_valid$Keywords[i]))) # copy pix in corresp dir
}
```
The data splitting criteria used here involve filtering the data based on row numbers, where the training set includes the first 20% of the rows, and the validation set includes the remaining 80% of the rows. This is done using the `filter` function in combination with the `between` function, which filters the data based on whether the row number falls within a specified range.

In summary, the data is split for deep learning model training by creating a training set and a validation set, where the training set includes the first 20% of the rows and the validation set includes the remaining 80% of the rows. The corresponding images are then stored in directories named 'train' and 'valid', respectively, and organized by categories based on keywords.
