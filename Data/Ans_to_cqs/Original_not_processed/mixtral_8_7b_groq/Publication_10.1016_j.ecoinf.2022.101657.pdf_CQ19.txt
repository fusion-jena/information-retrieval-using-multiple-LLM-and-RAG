Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about which framework was used to build the deep learning model for the DynAIkonTrap. The sources mention various deep learning models such as Multilayer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Network, and YOLOv4, but they do not specify the use of any particular framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

However, it is worth noting that TensorFlow and PyTorch are two of the most popular open-source frameworks for building and training deep learning models. TensorFlow is developed by Google Brain, while PyTorch is developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. Both frameworks provide extensive functionalities and large community support, making them suitable for various deep learning applications.

Given the popularity of these frameworks, it is possible that one of them was used to build the deep learning model for the DynAIkonTrap. However, without explicit information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
