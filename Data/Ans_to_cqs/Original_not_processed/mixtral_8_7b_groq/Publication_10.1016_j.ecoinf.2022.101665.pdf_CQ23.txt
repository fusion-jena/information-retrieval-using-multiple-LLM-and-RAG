Based on the provided context, the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model were not described. However, it is mentioned that the study addresses the assessment of the accuracy of a thematic map produced by a calibrated statistical prediction method, and that data availability is often limited. Therefore, resampling methods are used, specifically the k-fold cross-validation method.

In k-fold cross-validation, the full dataset is split into k approximately equally-sized disjoint subsets or folds. The model is then calibrated on k-1 folds, while the remaining fold is used for assessing prediction accuracy. This process is repeated k times, with a different fold used for testing in each iteration. The overall cross-validation accuracy is estimated by aggregating the (squared) residuals over the k folds. In conventional k-fold cross-validation, the folds are chosen randomly.

It is also mentioned that the use of confidence intervals from k-fold cross-validation is an unsolved puzzle requiring further research.

Therefore, while the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model are not specified, it can be inferred that k-fold cross-validation was used to assess the accuracy of the model.
