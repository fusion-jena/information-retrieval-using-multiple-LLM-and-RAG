Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix. The context focuses on the use of the F-UJI tool for assessing the adherence of datasets to the FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) using a JSON file with scores and other information.

However, the context mentions the use of a computational notebook (.ipynb document) provided by the FAIRsFAIR team for visualizing and summarizing the evaluation scores. This notebook might include various postprocessing steps for analyzing the assessment results. Specifically, it creates a data frame that includes all scores obtained for each of the 16 metrics and generates histogram plots of the results, visualizing each FAIR principle and the overall FAIR score.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention the postprocessing steps you asked about, it does describe a computational notebook used for visualizing and summarizing the FAIR assessment results, which might include some of the desired postprocessing steps. Nonetheless, the primary focus of the text is the FAIR assessment process using the F-UJI tool.
