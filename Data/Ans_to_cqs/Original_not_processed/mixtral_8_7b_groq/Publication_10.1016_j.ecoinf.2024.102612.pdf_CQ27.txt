Answer:::

The text provided does not give detailed information on the specific steps taken to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, it does provide context about how the trained model was used for fuel type classification.

After training the deep learning model using synthetic data and validating its performance using real MS point clouds, the model was used to classify the fuel types of real point clouds. The classification process involved segmenting real MS point clouds into samples and then using the trained model to make classifications on these samples. The resulting classifications were then used as inputs for a decision tree scheme, which was used to retrieve the final fuel models.

The text also highlights the importance of data augmentation during the training phase of deep learning models, particularly in the context of semantic classifications of real LiDAR point clouds. It suggests that enhancements in classification outcomes can be achieved using advanced deep learning classification models that can better handle complex and high-dimensional data from MS geoinformation such as LiDAR point clouds or MS imagery.

Therefore, while the text does not provide specific details on model deployment, it does provide context on how the trained model was used for fuel type classification and the importance of data augmentation during model training.
