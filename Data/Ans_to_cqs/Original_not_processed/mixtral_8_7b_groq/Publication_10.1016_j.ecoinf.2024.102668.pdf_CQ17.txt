Answer:::

The text provided does not directly discuss the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. However, it does contain information about the use of acoustic indices in the field of audio signal processing, which can be related to machine learning and deep learning.

In the context of audio signal processing, overfitting can occur when a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, resulting in poor generalization to new data. Regularization methods, such as dropout and L2 regularization, can be used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.

Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the model's weights to zero during training. This helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of weights and promoting the learning of more robust features.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the model's weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which can help to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.

While the text provided does not explicitly mention these regularization methods, it does discuss the importance of reducing device bias in the preprocessing of acoustic data. By reducing device bias, the applicability of acoustic indices for broader comparative analyses is enhanced, which is important for the development of machine learning and deep learning models that require consistent feature spaces across studies.

Therefore, while the text does not directly answer the query, it does provide relevant context about the use of acoustic indices in audio signal processing and the importance of reducing device bias in preprocessing, which can be related to the use of regularization methods in deep learning pipelines.
