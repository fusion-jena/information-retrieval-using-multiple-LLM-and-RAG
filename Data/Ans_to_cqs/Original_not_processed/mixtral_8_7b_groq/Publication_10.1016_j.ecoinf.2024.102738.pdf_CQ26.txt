Answer:::

The provided context does not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss some strategies related to sampling and data preparation that can be relevant to this topic.

In the context, the authors use simplified random sampling (Chuvieco, 2020) to distribute training areas. This method allows them to effectively capture variability within each class and improve the classification. While not explicitly stated, this approach could be considered a form of diverse data collection, as it aims to include a wide range of variability within the training data.

Additionally, the authors follow the recommendation of Chuvieco (2020) by using at least 196 test points for categorical variables. However, they also explore new sampling strategies that combine this scientific foundation with the capabilities of Google Earth Engine (GEE). This adaptability to the current technological context demonstrates an awareness of the importance of updating data processing methods to address potential biases.

As for the specific techniques mentioned in the query, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling, the context does not provide enough information to determine if these methods were used. These techniques are typically used to address class imbalance, a common issue in remote sensing and other fields, where some classes may have significantly more or fewer samples than others. Stratified splitting ensures that the train-test split is representative of the original dataset's class distribution, while oversampling and undersampling techniques modify the class distribution within the training set to improve model performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing, it does discuss strategies related to diverse data collection and adapting to new sampling capabilities. However, without further information, it is not possible to determine if techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling were used.
