Answer:::

The text provided discusses one method used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline: varying the train-test set ratio. However, it does not explicitly mention other regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Despite this, we can infer that dropout is used in the deep learning pipeline because it is mentioned that the first two fully connected layers of AlexNet have a dropout layer associated with them, with a dropout ratio of 0.5. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by making the network more robust and less dependent on the training data.

However, the text does not mention L2 regularization or weight decay, which is another common method used to prevent overfitting. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages the weights to be small, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.

Therefore, while the text does mention one method used to prevent overfitting (varying the train-test set ratio), it does not explicitly mention dropout or L2 regularization. However, we can infer that dropout is used based on the description of the AlexNet architecture. L2 regularization, on the other hand, is not mentioned or inferred in the text.
