Answer:::

The specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models mentioned in the given context are not explicitly stated. However, it is common practice in deep learning to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for training due to their ability to perform parallel computations, which significantly speeds up the training process compared to using Central Processing Units (CPUs).

For instance, the BERT model (Devlin et al., 2018) was pre-trained using Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which are custom-built hardware accelerators designed specifically for machine learning tasks. TPUs are similar to GPUs in their ability to perform parallel computations but are optimized for tensor operations commonly used in deep learning.

In the context of the ecological informatics and cultural ecosystem services papers (Edwards et al., 2022; Egarter Vigl et al., 2021), no specific information about hardware resources is provided. However, given the complexity of deep learning models, it is reasonable to assume that GPUs or TPUs were used for training.

In summary, while the specific hardware resources for training the deep learning models in the given context are not explicitly stated, it is common practice to use GPUs or TPUs for deep learning tasks due to their ability to perform parallel computations. The BERT model was specifically trained using TPUs.
