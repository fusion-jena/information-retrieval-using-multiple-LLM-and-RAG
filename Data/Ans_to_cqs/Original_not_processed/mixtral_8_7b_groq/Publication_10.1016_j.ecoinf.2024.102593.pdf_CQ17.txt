Answer:::
The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models for analyzing bird sounds, including the challenges faced during training and the application of dimensionality reduction techniques. However, it does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.

Regularization methods are essential to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of models and improving their generalization ability. Common regularization techniques include L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping.

L1 and L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, add a penalty term to the loss function, which encourages the model to have smaller weights. L1 regularization results in sparse models, where some weights become exactly zero, while L2 regularization generally leads to smaller weights for all features.

Dropout is a technique that randomly sets a fraction of neurons to zero during training, effectively creating an ensemble of models. This helps prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of feature detectors.

Early stopping is a method that monitors the model's performance on a validation set during training. Once the performance on the validation set stops improving or starts degrading, the training process is halted, preventing the model from further overfitting to the training data.

While the provided context does not discuss these specific regularization techniques, it is reasonable to assume that they were employed during the training of deep neural networks (DNNs) mentioned in the text. These methods are standard practices in deep learning and help ensure that models can generalize well to unseen data.
