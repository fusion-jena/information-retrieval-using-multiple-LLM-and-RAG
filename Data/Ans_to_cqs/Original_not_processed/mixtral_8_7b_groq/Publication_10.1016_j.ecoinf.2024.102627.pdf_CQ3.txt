Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for mapping global orchid assemblages. The text focuses on the methodology used to optimize a model for predicting species assemblages based on presence-only observations, and the spatial indicator called Species Assemblage.

The deep learning framework used for training the model is not specified, and there is no mention of any particular data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. It can be inferred that the data used in this study might not require such techniques, as the objective is to predict the presence or absence of species based on environmental variables rather than identifying specific instances of objects within images.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
