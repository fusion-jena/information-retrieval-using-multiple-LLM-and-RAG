Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the models are optimized in the mentioned studies. Hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in training machine learning models, and it can be done through various methods such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, or using tools like Hyperopt, Optuna, or scikit-optimize.

In the context, the following studies use different methods for bird sound classification:

1. Sakashita et al. (2018) used an adaptive ensemble of acoustic features for bird species classification. However, they did not mention the specific method for hyperparameter optimization.
2. Salamon et al. (2017) fused shallow and deep learning models for bird species classification. They used a combination of Mel-spectrogram, harmonic-component based spectrogram, and percussive-component based spectrogram as input features. They employed a SubSpectralNet architecture, but the hyperparameter optimization method is not specified.
3. Salamon et al. (2016) worked on the automatic classification of avian flight calls for bioacoustic monitoring. They used a deep learning model, but the hyperparameter optimization method is not mentioned.
4. Simonyan and Zisserman (2015) introduced very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition. Although their work is not directly related to bird sound classification, their deep learning architecture might have been used in the mentioned studies. However, they did not discuss hyperparameter optimization in their paper.
5. Incze et al. (2018) used a convolutional neural network for bird sound recognition. The paper does not mention the hyperparameter optimization method.
6. Jancovic and Köküer (2019) used unsupervised modeling of individual vocalization elements for bird species recognition. They did not mention the hyperparameter optimization method.
7. Knight et al. (2019) improved the accuracy of bioacoustic classification using convolutional neural networks by optimizing pre-processing spectrogram parameters. However, they did not discuss the optimization of the model's hyperparameters.
8. Kong et al. (2017) used a joint detection and classification convolutional neural network on weakly labeled bird audio detection. The paper does not mention the hyperparameter optimization method.

In conclusion, the provided context does not offer information on how the hyperparameters of the models are optimized. Grid search, random search, or other optimization techniques might have been used, but it is not specified in the studies.
