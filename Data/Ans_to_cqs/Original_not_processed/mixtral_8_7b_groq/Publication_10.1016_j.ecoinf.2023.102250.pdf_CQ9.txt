Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. None of the sources mention where the datasets used in the studies are available or if they have been shared in open repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.

The context does provide a list of datasets, including MobileNetV2, ResNet18, VGG16, and several custom datasets (Ori, G1\_Dataset1, G1\_Dataset2, ..., G3\_Dataset3\_mixup). However, it does not specify where these datasets can be accessed.

Additionally, the context discusses various techniques and methods used in deep learning pipelines, such as spectral normalization, LeakyReLU activation, and dynamic convolutional kernels. While these methods are essential for constructing a deep learning pipeline, they do not provide information about the data repository.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
