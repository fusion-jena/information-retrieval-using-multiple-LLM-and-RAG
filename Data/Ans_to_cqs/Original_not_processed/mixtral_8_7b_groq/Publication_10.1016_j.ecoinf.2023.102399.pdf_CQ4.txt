Based on the provided articles, there is no explicit mention of the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipelines for fish biomass estimation or fish detection and species classification. However, some of the commonly used data augmentation techniques in computer vision tasks, such as flipping, rotating, and scaling, can be inferred as potential techniques.

Data augmentation is a strategy that enables increasing the diversity of the training dataset by applying various transformations to the existing images (Taylor & Nguyen, 2018). This approach helps improve the robustness and generalization ability of deep learning models. Some common data augmentation techniques are:

1. Flipping: This technique involves horizontally or vertically flipping the images, creating a mirrored version of the original image. Flipping helps the model learn symmetrical features and prevents overfitting.
2. Rotating: Rotating the images at different angles can help the model learn features invariant to orientation. This technique is particularly useful in underwater environments where the camera might be at an angle concerning the fish.
3. Scaling: Scaling or zooming the images can help the model learn features at different scales. This technique is useful for handling variations in fish size and distance from the camera.

While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided articles, they are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for computer vision tasks. Researchers can use these techniques to increase the diversity of their training datasets and improve their models' performance.
