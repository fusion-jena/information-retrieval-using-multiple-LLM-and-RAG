Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of two evaluation metrics: the Area Under the Curve (AUC) and the True Skill Statistic (TSS). These metrics are used to objectively compare the performances of the Species Distribution Models (SDMs) used in the study.

During the training process, threshold values from 0 to 1 are used for each SDM. The AUC and TSS metrics are then calculated for each threshold value, and the results are summarized in Table 5. The AUC metric measures the model's ability to distinguish between presences and absences, while the TSS metric measures the model's overall accuracy.

Additionally, the proposed incremental Pseudo-Labeling with Early Stopping (PL-EPL) method is used to monitor the model performance during training. This method involves training a student model using a teacher model that generates pseudo-labeled data points for unlabeled data. The number of data points added in each PL iteration is determined carefully to ensure the accuracy of the SDP-EPL. Specifically, it was found that allowing the initial teacher model to generate too many pseudo-labeled data points adversely affects the subsequent training of the teacher model, producing inaccurate student models. Therefore, the number of data points added in each PL iteration should be determined carefully to ensure the accuracy of the SDP-EPL. In this study, K = 200 performed optimally for most cases.

The training process also involves monitoring the performance of the ensemble teacher model and the student model. The ensemble teacher model is trained using labeled data points, while the student model is trained using both labeled and pseudo-labeled data points. The performance of the ensemble teacher model and the student model is monitored using the AUC and TSS metrics.

In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of the AUC and TSS metrics for each threshold value, the proposed incremental PL-EPL method, and the monitoring of the performance of the ensemble teacher model and the student model. This strategy ensures that the model performance is accurately monitored during training, allowing for adjustments to be made as needed to improve the model's accuracy.
