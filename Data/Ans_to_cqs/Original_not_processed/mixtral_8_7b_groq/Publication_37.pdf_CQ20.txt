Answer:::
The context does not provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions that the convolutional neural network (CNN) model is implemented in Python using Lasagne, and data stream multiplexing is implemented using Pescador. However, it does not specify whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware accelerators were used during the training process. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
