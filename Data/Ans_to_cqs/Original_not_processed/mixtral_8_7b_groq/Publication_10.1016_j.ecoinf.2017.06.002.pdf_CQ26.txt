The provided context discusses the FRAMES data reporting framework, which focuses on making data reporting easier for data originators and improving data comparability, but it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide information on some preprocessing approaches used in the FRAMES framework that could be relevant to data bias reduction.

In the FRAMES framework, data files are associated with a "Data Column Description" template that includes information on data types, units, and a location identifier. This separation of data column description from the data file description allows for customization of data column descriptions, which can be useful for diverse data collection. Additionally, FRAMES includes a semi-standardized template for data files that provides information on header rows, column names, data averaging, and measurement IDs. These features can support better documentation and understanding of the data, which can help in identifying and addressing data bias during preprocessing.

As for specific techniques to address data bias during preprocessing, the context does not provide information on this. However, some common techniques used in deep learning preprocessing include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain criteria (e.g., class labels) and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to ensure that each group is represented proportionally in the training and testing sets.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class in the dataset to balance it with the majority class.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class in the dataset to balance it with the minority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population being studied.

These techniques can help reduce data bias during preprocessing by ensuring that the dataset is balanced and representative of the population being studied. However, the specific technique used will depend on the nature of the dataset and the problem being addressed.
