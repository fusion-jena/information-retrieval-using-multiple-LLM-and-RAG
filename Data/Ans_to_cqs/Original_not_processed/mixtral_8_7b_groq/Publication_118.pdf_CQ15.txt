Answer:::

The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is the "Adam" optimization algorithm. This information is provided in the first piece of context, which states: "The 'Adam' optimization algorithm was used." The Adam optimization algorithm is a popular choice for deep learning tasks due to its efficiency and ability to adapt to different problems. It is a type of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, which are a class of optimization methods used to minimize the loss function in machine learning. However, the specific type of SGD algorithm used in this case is Adam.
