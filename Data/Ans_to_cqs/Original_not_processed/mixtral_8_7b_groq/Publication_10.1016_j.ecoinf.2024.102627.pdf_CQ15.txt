Answer:::

The provided context does not give explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. However, it does mention that a deep neural network is trained with a cross-entropy loss function. The choice of optimization technique often depends on the specific requirements of the problem and the characteristics of the data. Common optimization techniques for training deep learning models include SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad. It is possible that any of these methods or others could have been used in this pipeline, but the specific method was not mentioned in the provided context.
