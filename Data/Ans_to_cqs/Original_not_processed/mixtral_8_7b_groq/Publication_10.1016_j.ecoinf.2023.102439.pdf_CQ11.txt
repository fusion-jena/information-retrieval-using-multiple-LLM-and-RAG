Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or a specific data repository link related to it. The context focuses on Land Surface Temperature (LST) retrieval and ecological modelling using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), particularly the NARX model. The LST dataset was obtained from the MOD11A2 product of MODIS-TERRA sensor, and NDBI data from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS was used. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link for it.
