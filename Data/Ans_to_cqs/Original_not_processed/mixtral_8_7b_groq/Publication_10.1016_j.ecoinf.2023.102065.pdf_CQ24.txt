Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning in the field of ecoacoustics, specifically for bird species recognition. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value or other strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

However, there are some strategies that can be inferred from the given context:

1. Data splitting: The data is split into training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. The splitting of data into these sets is often done randomly to ensure that each set is representative of the entire dataset.
2. Data augmentation: In the study by Quinn et al. (2022), ROIs (Regions of Interest) that were less than 2 seconds in duration were expanded (padded) equally on each side to total 2 seconds. This is a form of data augmentation, which can help increase the size of the training set and reduce overfitting.
3. Fine-tuning: In the study by Roca et al. (2022), a pre-trained CNN model is fine-tuned using ROIs with species presence. Fine-tuning involves updating the weights of the pre-trained model using a smaller dataset, which can help reduce the risk of overfitting and improve generalization.
4. Model selection: In the study by Quinn et al. (2022), different CNN architectures were compared to determine the best model for the task. This involves training multiple models with different architectures and selecting the one with the best performance on the validation set. This process can help reduce the risk of overfitting and improve generalization.

While these strategies do not directly address the issue of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they can help reduce the risk of overfitting and improve the generalization of the model. Additionally, the use of a random seed value can be employed to ensure reproducibility of the results, although it is not mentioned in the provided context.
