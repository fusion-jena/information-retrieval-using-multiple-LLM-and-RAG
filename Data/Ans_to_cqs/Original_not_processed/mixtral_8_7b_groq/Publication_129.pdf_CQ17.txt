Answer:::
The context provided does not specifically mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is common practice in deep learning to use techniques such as dropout, L2 regularization, and data augmentation to prevent overfitting.

Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent over-dependence on any single neuron and thus reduces overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the norm of the weights, which encourages the weights to be small and thus reduces overfitting. Data augmentation is a technique where the training data is artificially expanded by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to the existing data. This helps to increase the amount of training data and reduces overfitting by providing the model with more varied examples.

In the context of the insect pest recognition system, it is likely that one or more of these regularization techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting. However, the specific regularization methods used are not mentioned in the provided context.
