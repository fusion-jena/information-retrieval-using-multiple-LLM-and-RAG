Answer:::

The provided context does not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss some strategies related to data handling and bias reduction in machine learning and deep learning contexts.

One approach to handling bias is diverse data collection. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals document highlights the importance of gathering diverse data to ensure that the needs of different communities and demographics are adequately represented. By collecting data from various sources and ensuring that it is representative of the population, it is possible to reduce potential biases.

In the context of machine learning and deep learning, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling can be used to address data imbalance and potential bias. Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subgroups based on specific criteria and then randomly sampling from these subgroups to ensure that each subset is proportionally represented in the training and testing datasets. Oversampling and undersampling techniques can be used to adjust the class distribution in the dataset, either by duplicating samples from the minority class (oversampling) or removing samples from the majority class (undersampling). These techniques can help improve model performance and reduce bias in cases where the dataset is imbalanced.

The context also discusses the use of the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, which has robust explanatory and predictive capabilities. XGBoost can handle various types of data and can be used to address complex problems, potentially reducing bias by providing more accurate predictions.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling, it does discuss the importance of diverse data collection and the use of robust machine learning models like XGBoost to handle complex problems and potentially reduce bias.
