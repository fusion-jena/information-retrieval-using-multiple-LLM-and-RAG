Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. The context mainly focuses on the results and methodology of the study, which analyzes the impact of urban forests on human mobility patterns.

The study mentions the use of devices and the calculation of various metrics such as R2-Threshold and ASPL (average shortest path length) for different land use types, including commercial areas and urban forests. However, there is no reference to the code repository or any development platform used for the deep learning pipeline.

To access the code repository, you may consider contacting the authors directly using the contact information provided in the study. They might be able to share the code or provide information about where it is hosted.

Another option would be to search for the authors' names or the title of the study on popular code hosting platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. If the code has been made publicly available, it might be possible to find it through these channels.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. You may try contacting the authors or searching for the code on popular development platforms.
