Answer:::

Based on the provided context, a Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) neural network approach is used for the identification of ecological sources. However, it's important to note that SOFM is not a type of deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. SOFM is a type of artificial neural network that is typically considered shallow due to its single layer of neurons. Therefore, the pipeline described in the context does not involve any deep learning models.
