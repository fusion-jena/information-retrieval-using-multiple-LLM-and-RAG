The provided context does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as whether a grid search, random search, or other methods were used. However, it does mention that different numbers of neurons in the hidden layer of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model were compared to determine the best model.

The authors compared the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R values for different numbers of neurons in the ANN system. After this comparison, they determined that the best model for predicting biomass density had 6 hidden layer neurons. They evaluated the performance of this model using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and MSE as performance indicators.

Therefore, while the specific method used to optimize the hyperparameters is not mentioned, it is clear that the authors compared the performance of models with different numbers of neurons in the hidden layer to determine the optimal model.
