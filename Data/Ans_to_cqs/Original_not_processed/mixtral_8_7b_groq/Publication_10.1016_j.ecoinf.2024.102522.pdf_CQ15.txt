Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline of the studies by J. Ye et al. (2024).

The context includes information about two studies by J. Ye et al. (2024) published in the journal Ecological Informatics. The studies focus on variable classification, specifically bioclimate variables, biological factors, and geographical environment factors. Additionally, the studies extracted slope and aspect raster data. However, there is no mention of any optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Optimization techniques are crucial in deep learning to minimize the loss function and improve model performance. Common optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop). These techniques update the model's parameters during training to minimize the loss function.

Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline of the studies by J. Ye et al. (2024).
