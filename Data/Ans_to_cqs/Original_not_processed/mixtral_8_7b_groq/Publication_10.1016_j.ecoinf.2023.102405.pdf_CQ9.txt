Answer:

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The text does not mention any specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF in relation to this research. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.

However, it is mentioned that the research uses real-time data from IoT devices for water contamination classification in aquaculture. This data could potentially be available from the IoT devices themselves or from the researchers upon request, but this is not specified in the text.

It is always important to check the original research paper or contact the authors directly for such information. The paper "Water contamination analysis in IoT enabled aquaculture using deep learning based AODEGRU" by Peda Gopi Arepalli and K. Jairam Naik, published in the Ecological Informatics journal, would be the best source for this information.
