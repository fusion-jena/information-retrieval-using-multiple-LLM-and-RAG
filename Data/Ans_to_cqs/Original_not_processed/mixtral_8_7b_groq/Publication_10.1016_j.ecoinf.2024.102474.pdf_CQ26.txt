Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of a dataset from the EarthNet2021 Challenge, consisting of 23,904 training datacubes located across Europe, and various deep learning techniques employed for processing this data. However, it does not explicitly mention the strategies used to address data bias during preprocessing.

Nonetheless, some common techniques to address data bias during preprocessing in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Stratified splitting: This method involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific features (strata) and then ensuring that each stratum is proportionally represented in both training and testing sets. This can help maintain balance and avoid bias in the data split.

2. Oversampling: When a particular class or group is underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from that class. This can help balance the dataset and prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

3. Undersampling: In contrast to oversampling, undersampling reduces the number of instances from the majority class to balance the dataset. However, this method may result in loss of valuable information.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources, locations, and conditions can help ensure that the dataset is representative and less biased. This can lead to a more generalizable model.

While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is possible that they were employed during the preprocessing of the EarthNet2021 dataset. The context does mention the use of an Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization procedure, which suggests that care was taken to ensure the quality of the model and its performance on the dataset. However, without explicit confirmation, it is impossible to say for certain which techniques were used to address data bias during preprocessing.
