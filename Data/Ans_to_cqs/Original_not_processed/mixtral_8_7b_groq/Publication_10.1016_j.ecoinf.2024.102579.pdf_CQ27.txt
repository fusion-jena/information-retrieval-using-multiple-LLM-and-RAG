Based on the provided context, there is no information about the training or deployment of a deep learning model. The text discusses different methods for estimating forest attributes, specifically the inventory estimator, NN1, and NN2 estimators. These methods are used to calculate forest attributes based on sample tree data.

The inventory estimator is a simple mean of the values of sample trees within a given sample point, while NN1 and NN2 are more complex estimators that consider the data of neighboring trees. These estimators are used in the context of forestry and ecological informatics, and the text suggests future research to optimize these estimators.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer regarding the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, as the provided context does not contain any information on this topic.
