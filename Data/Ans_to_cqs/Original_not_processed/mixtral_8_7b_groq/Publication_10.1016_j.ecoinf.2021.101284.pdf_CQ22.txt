Answer:::
The provided context does not include information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model for COVID-19 cases. However, it is mentioned that a deep learning algorithm was used for early diagnosis of COVID-19 patients based on X-ray and computed tomography images (Castillo, 2020).

In general, when evaluating the performance of a deep learning model for classification tasks, several metrics can be used, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions (correctly predicted positive cases) to the total number of positive predictions. Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive cases. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which gives equal weight to both measures. AUC-ROC is a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.

Therefore, it is possible that one or more of these metrics were used to evaluate the deep learning model for COVID-19 cases in the study. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
