The context provided does not give specific information about the deep learning frameworks used to build the models for tree species classification. However, it does provide information about the types of tree species classified and the performance of three different deep learning algorithms (VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet) in classifying these tree species.

The table shows the unweighted average (UA), partial average (PA), and F1-score for each algorithm in classifying the different tree species. The overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa coefficient are also provided, which give an idea of the overall performance of the algorithms.

The text describes some of the advantages and disadvantages of the different algorithms, such as the depth of the networks, the use of auxiliary classifiers, and the use of batch normalization to prevent vanishing or exploding gradients.

Therefore, while the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models are not mentioned, the context provides information about the classification performance of three different deep learning algorithms on a specific dataset of tree species.
