Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The sources cited are research articles published in Ecological Informatics, which primarily discuss the methodology, data, and results of the study. They do not mention any specific code repositories such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket where the deep learning pipeline code might be available.

It is possible that the code repository was not included in the provided context or was not made publicly available due to various reasons such as intellectual property rights or ongoing research. If you are interested in accessing the code, I would recommend contacting the authors of the study directly. Their contributions are listed as Zipeng Gu and Xingwei Li, and their affiliations are provided in the CRediT authorship contribution statement. They may be able to provide more information about the deep learning pipeline and its availability.
