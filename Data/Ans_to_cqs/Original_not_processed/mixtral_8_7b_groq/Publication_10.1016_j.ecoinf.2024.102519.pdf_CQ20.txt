The provided context does not include specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that deep learning has been successfully applied in various research areas, so it can be inferred that suitable hardware resources, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), were used to handle the computational requirements of deep learning models. These specialized hardware components can significantly accelerate the training process compared to using only CPUs. Nonetheless, without explicit information in the context, a precise answer cannot be given.
