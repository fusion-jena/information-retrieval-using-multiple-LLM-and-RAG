Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific type of deep learning model (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) used in the pipeline. The context focuses on the importance of metadata, image and data curation, and documentation in imaging projects, particularly in the context of ecological monitoring and satellite/aerial images.

Answer:::
The context includes references to various studies and resources related to ecological monitoring, imaging projects, and metadata standards. However, it does not provide information about the specific deep learning model employed in the pipeline.

Answer:::
The studies mentioned in the context, such as Hampton et al. (2013), Hartman et al. (2021), Hill and Wilkinson (2004), and Horton et al. (n.d.), focus on the importance of metadata, data management, and ecological monitoring. While they may involve deep learning techniques, the context does not specify the type of deep learning model used.

Answer:::
In summary, the provided context does not contain information about the specific deep learning model (CNN, RNN, Transformer, etc.) used in the pipeline. It mainly discusses metadata, image and data curation, and documentation in imaging projects.
