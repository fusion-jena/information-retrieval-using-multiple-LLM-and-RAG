Answer:::
The provided context does not directly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses a study that uses a balanced, open-access, global dataset of vegetation plots from the Global Ecology and Biogeography journal. This dataset likely includes tabular data in a CSV format, as it is a common format for ecological data. Additionally, the study references a technique for species distribution modeling from the PLoS One journal, which might involve raster data formats such as GeoTIFF for environmental covariates. However, the context does not explicitly state the use of image, audio, or video data formats in the deep learning pipeline.
