Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves a practice-oriented validation approach where the data is split on the sticky plate level. This means that individual insects that belong to the same sticky plate image are kept together in the same dataset (training, validation, or testing). This method allows for the validation of the model's performance by emulating the way it will be used in practice. The model predicts a class for any given object it detects on unseen sticky plate images, data it has never seen during training.

This approach is taken to avoid overestimation of the model's performance, a common issue when using weak validation procedures like random data splitting. Previous research has shown that model performance can be significantly overestimated using these methods. Other studies have focused on datasets where insect classes are quite broad, such as at the order or family level, which are relatively easy to classify.

The focus on data-centric approaches in monitoring model performance is based on the assumption that wrong detections can be caused by intra- or inter-class variability, class imbalance, or labeling errors. This approach takes into account the variability and complexity of the data, which can significantly impact the model's performance.

In addition, the imaging setup, including the aperture (F/10), ISO (160), shutter speed (1/15 s), focal length (55 mm), and white balance ("Incandescent"), can also affect the model's performance. These factors can influence the quality and consistency of the data, which in turn can impact the model's ability to accurately classify the insects.

Overall, the strategy for monitoring model performance during training involves a combination of a practice-oriented validation approach, data-centric considerations, and an awareness of the impact of the imaging setup. This comprehensive approach helps to ensure that the model's performance is accurately evaluated and optimized for real-world use.
