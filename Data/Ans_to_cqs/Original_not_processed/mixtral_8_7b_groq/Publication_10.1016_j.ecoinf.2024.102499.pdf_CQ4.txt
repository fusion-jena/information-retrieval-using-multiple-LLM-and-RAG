Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling that were applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that all images were resized to 1333 Ã— 800 pixels to match with the pre-training data. This can be considered as a form of data augmentation called scaling, where the images were resized to a specific dimension.

Additionally, the models were trained on their own version of Trainingclips through 200,000 iterations. During this training phase, it is possible that data augmentation techniques were applied, but the text does not provide information on this. Data augmentation techniques like flipping and rotating are commonly used to increase the size of the training dataset, improve model performance, and prevent overfitting. Therefore, it is possible that these techniques were used in this study, but it is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
