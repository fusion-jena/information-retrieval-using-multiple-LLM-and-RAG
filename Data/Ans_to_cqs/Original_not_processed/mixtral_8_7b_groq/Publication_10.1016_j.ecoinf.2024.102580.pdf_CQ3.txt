The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models for vegetation mapping in ecology and conservation, but it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does imply the use of semantic segmentation for vegetation mapping, which is a type of data annotation technique.

Semantic segmentation is a pixel-level image segmentation method that classifies each pixel in an image into a specific class, such as vegetation, bare substrate, or other. This method is used for vegetation mapping in the study, and it can be seen as a more advanced form of image labeling or image annotation.

The context also mentions the limitations of deep learning methods, specifically the classification of the 'other' class, which includes rocks, coral, and debris. This limitation highlights the importance of quality training data in deep learning, and creating accurate annotated imagery for training can be time-consuming. However, it also mentions new tools that utilize artificial intelligence to assist in the annotation of ground-truth images, such as v7 labs and AnyLabeling.

So, it can be inferred that semantic segmentation is used for data annotation in the deep learning pipeline, and new tools that utilize artificial intelligence for image annotation are mentioned. However, it does not provide specific details on other data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
