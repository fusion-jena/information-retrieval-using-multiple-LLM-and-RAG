The provided context discusses data management and citation in the ESS-DIVE database, as well as some challenges faced in data integration and citation. However, it does not directly address techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.

In the context of data preprocessing for deep learning, data bias can lead to poor model performance and inaccurate predictions. To address data bias, several techniques can be employed:

1. Stratified sampling: During the data splitting process, stratified sampling ensures that the train, validation, and test sets have a similar distribution of classes. This technique is useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where one class may have significantly more instances than another.

2. Oversampling: In oversampling, instances of the minority class are duplicated to balance the dataset. This technique can help the model learn more about the minority class, but it may also lead to overfitting if not done carefully.

3. Undersampling: Undersampling involves reducing the number of instances in the majority class to balance the dataset. This technique can help prevent overfitting but may result in loss of valuable information.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources can help reduce bias by ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population. This technique can be particularly useful when dealing with selection bias, where certain segments of the population may be underrepresented in the dataset.

5. Data augmentation: Data augmentation involves creating new instances by applying transformations to the existing data. This technique can help increase the size of the dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize.

6. Reweighting: Reweighting involves assigning different weights to instances based on their class distribution. This technique can help the model learn more about the minority class without oversampling or undersampling.

While the provided context does not discuss these techniques directly, they are commonly used in data preprocessing for deep learning to address data bias.
