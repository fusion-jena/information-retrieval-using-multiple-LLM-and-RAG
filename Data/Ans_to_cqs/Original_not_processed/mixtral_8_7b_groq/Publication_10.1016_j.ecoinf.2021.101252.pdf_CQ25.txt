Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning model, as described in the given context, is to classify cases in a dataset. This is evident in Case Study 1, where the performance of the candidate models and the selected model is measured using the proportion of correctly classified cases. The term "cases" is used, but the specific type of data and the exact nature of the classification task are not provided.

In addition, the deep learning models are referred to as "architectures," suggesting that they are designed to perform specific tasks such as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, the context does not explicitly state what task these models are designed to perform beyond classification.

The concept of "deep" in deep learning refers to the ability of these models to train large numbers of hidden layers and neurons, enabling them to capture complex patterns and achieve a deeper hierarchy of features. While the context does not explicitly state how these models use these features for classification, it can be inferred that the models use these features to improve their ability to classify cases accurately.

Overall, while the context provides some insight into the purpose of the deep learning model, it does not explicitly state the specific task the models are designed to perform beyond classification.
