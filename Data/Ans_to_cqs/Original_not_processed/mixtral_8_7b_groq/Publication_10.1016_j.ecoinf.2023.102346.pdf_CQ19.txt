Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the use of deep learning models in the specific studies mentioned. Therefore, I cannot confirm the use of any particular framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for building deep learning models in these studies.

However, it is mentioned that eight different machine learning algorithms were tested for habitat suitability prediction, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Generalized Boosting regression Model (GBM), and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT). These algorithms are not exclusive to deep learning and can be implemented in various frameworks.

In general, for deep learning models, popular frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Caffe. TensorFlow and PyTorch are widely used and well-documented frameworks for building deep learning models. TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google Brain Team, while PyTorch is a popular open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library. Both frameworks support building and training deep learning models for various applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and time series forecasting.

Therefore, while the provided context does not specify the use of any deep learning frameworks, it is essential to note that various frameworks are available for building deep learning models when needed.
