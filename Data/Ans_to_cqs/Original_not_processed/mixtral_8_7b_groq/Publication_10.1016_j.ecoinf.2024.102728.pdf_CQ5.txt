Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for object retrieval or image processing, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention the use of deep convolutional neural networks for object retrieval in Mohedano et al. (2017) and deep learning for feature extraction in remote sensing in Petrovska et al. (2020). It is likely that these studies used one or more of the commonly used datasets in deep learning for training and testing their models.

In addition, the context includes references to several geographic information system (GIS) products and data sources, such as the Geographic Information System Software (QGIS), the Geospatial Portal of the Survey of Israel, and the Orthophoto 12.5 cm resolution product of the Survey of Israel. These data sources may be used for remote sensing and image processing applications, but they are not specifically mentioned as datasets used in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give a direct answer to the query, it suggests that the commonly used datasets in deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, may have been used in the deep learning pipelines for object retrieval and feature extraction in remote sensing.
