Answer:::
The specific deep learning framework used to build the model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model is a deep neural network trained with a cross-entropy loss function. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch, which are two popular deep learning frameworks, provide support for building and training neural networks with cross-entropy loss functions. Therefore, it can be inferred that the model was likely built using either TensorFlow or PyTorch.
