Answer:::

I am unable to provide the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline because the provided context does not include information about the data or the repository where it is stored. The context mainly discusses the development and application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for predicting mosquito abundances and indoor air quality, but it does not mention any data repository or sharing platform.

The context does mention that the data set was randomly split into two sets, one for model training and the other for model testing. However, it does not provide a link to where the data can be accessed or downloaded.

Therefore, I am sorry for any inconvenience, but I cannot provide the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
