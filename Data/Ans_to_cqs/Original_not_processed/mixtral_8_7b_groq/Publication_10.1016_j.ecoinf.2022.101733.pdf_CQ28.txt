Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention which cloud platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used for processing and analyzing geospatial data. GEE is a cloud-based platform that provides high-performance computing resources for processing big data, and it consists of a multi-petabyte analysis-ready data catalog co-located with a high-performance, intrinsically parallel computation service. It is accessed and controlled through an internet-accessible application programming interface (API) and an associated web-based interactive development environment (IDE) that enables rapid prototyping and visualization of results.

It is mentioned that GEE was used for processing different batches of Sentinel-2 data, which includes visible (red, green, and blue) bands, multi-spectral bands, spectral indices, spectral features, textural features, and Digital Surface Model (DSM) data. Also, it is used for Glacier Segmentation in Satellite Images, Mapping paddy rice using Sentinel-1 SAR time series, and large-scale crop mapping from multisource remote sensing images.

It is not explicitly mentioned that the deep learning model was deployed on GEE, but it is possible that it was since GEE provides a platform for developing and deploying models. However, it is not possible to confirm with the provided context.
