Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after training an ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) model. However, it is mentioned that ELMs can determine the appropriate output weights for effective problem resolution and they have the potential to generalize based on their training data set. These points suggest that some evaluation of the model's performance is likely carried out after training.

In the context of machine learning, common postprocessing steps after training a model include:

1. **Model Evaluation Metrics**: Calculating metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean squared error, to assess the model's performance.

2. **Confusion Matrix**: This is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. It's mostly used in supervised learning to observe the performance of a classification model on a set of test data for which the true values are known.

3. **Saliency Maps**: These are a useful tool for understanding and debugging the predictions of deep learning models. They provide a visualization of the parts of the input that the model considers most important for its prediction.

However, the context does not specify whether these or other postprocessing steps are involved in ELM model training. Therefore, without further information, a precise answer cannot be given.
