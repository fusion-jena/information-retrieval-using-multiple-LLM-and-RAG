Based on the provided context, there are no specific details about the preprocessing steps applied to the bird sound signals before training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the deep feature loss-based bird sound noise reduction network was trained for 50 epochs on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10. In each epoch, the entire training set was presented in a random order, with one noisy bird sound signal per iteration.

Moreover, the network architecture consists of dilated convolutional layers, where the number of feature maps increases with each layer from 20 in the first layer to 212 in the 13th layer. Batch normalization was performed using the adaptive normalization operator proposed by Chen et al. (2017), and a non-linear operation was implemented using a leaky rectified linear unit (LReLU).

Therefore, based on the general practice of deep learning model training, it can be inferred that some preprocessing steps might have been applied, such as:

1. Normalization: It is a common preprocessing step in deep learning to normalize the input data to have zero mean and unit variance. This helps the model to converge faster and avoids the vanishing gradient problem. However, the context does not provide information on whether normalization was applied to the bird sound signals.
2. Scaling: Scaling the input data to a specific range can help the model to learn better. For instance, audio signals can be scaled to a range of -1 to 1 or 0 to 1. The context does not provide information on whether scaling was applied to the bird sound signals.
3. Cleaning: The context mentions that the deep feature loss-based bird sound noise reduction network was developed to reduce non-smooth noise in field recordings, which are often composed of significant amounts of non-smooth noise. Therefore, it can be inferred that some cleaning process might have been applied to the bird sound signals before training the model. However, the context does not provide specific details about the cleaning process.

In summary, based on the provided context, there are no specific details about the preprocessing steps applied to the bird sound signals before training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that some preprocessing steps, such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning, might have been applied.
