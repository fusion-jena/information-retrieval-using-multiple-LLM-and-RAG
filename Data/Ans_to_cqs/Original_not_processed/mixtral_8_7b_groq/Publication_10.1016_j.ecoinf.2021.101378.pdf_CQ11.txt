Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct link to a data repository for a deep learning pipeline related to pine wilt disease. However, there are several studies and resources mentioned that use machine learning techniques, such as maximum entropy modeling (Maxent), random forest, and artificial neural networks, to model and analyze the occurrence and potential distribution of pine wilt disease.

For instance, Hirata et al. (2017) used Maxent to predict the potential distribution of pine wilt disease under future climate change scenarios. Ikegami and Jenkins (2018) also used Maxent to estimate the global risks of pine wilt disease under current and future climates. Iordache et al. (2020) developed a machine learning approach to detect pine wilt disease using airborne spectral imagery.

Moreover, the context provides information on the data sources and methods used to calculate the distance to roads, which could be useful for developing a deep learning pipeline for pine wilt disease. The distance to road data was calculated by combining road data obtained from the National Spatial Data Infrastructure Portal (<http://www.nsdi.go.kr>) and the Intelligent Transport Systems of Standard Node Link (<http://nodelink.its.go.kr>).

Therefore, while there is no direct link to a data repository for a deep learning pipeline, the provided context offers valuable resources and information for developing a deep learning model for pine wilt disease. Researchers and practitioners interested in developing a deep learning pipeline for pine wilt disease could consider using these resources and building upon the existing machine learning models and data sources.
