Answer:
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context consists of several figures and tables from a research paper titled "Ecological Informatics," authored by E. Joelianto et al., published in 2024. These materials detail the methodology and results of their research, which involves using a convolutional neural network (CNN) for deep learning in an ecological context.

The figures and tables describe the feature extraction flowchart, the model of deep learning layers, the mathematical equation of the convolution process, the combinations of CNN deep learning model parameters, a performance test of each configuration, and the standard deviation values for each performance metric. However, there is no mention of a code repository link.

Therefore, I cannot provide the requested link as it is not part of the given context. I hope this clarifies the situation.
