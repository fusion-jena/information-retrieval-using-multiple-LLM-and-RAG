The provided context does not directly discuss the data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text focuses on a method called redescription mining, which is tailored for biogeographic analyses and aims to identify distinct patterns within datasets.

Redescription mining generates a large number of redescriptions, each holding on a subregion within the dataset. These subregions can overlap, and the same subregion can potentially be described by different variables. Due to the large number of redundant or very similar redescriptions, computational means are needed to remove redundant patterns and identify the most informative (distinct) ones.

The method requires manually setting several parameters, including thresholds on the size of the support of the output redescriptions and controlling the length and complexity of their queries. The support of a redescription is the intersection of the supports of the two queries, and their union is required to contain at least 1% and at most 70% of all localities. This is an inclusive choice that aims at capturing local patterns.

While this method shares similarities with data annotation techniques in that it involves manually setting parameters and identifying patterns within datasets, it does not explicitly mention or describe the use of techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
