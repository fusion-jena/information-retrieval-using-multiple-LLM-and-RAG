The raw data used in the deep learning pipeline for bat call detection in the study mentioned comes from acoustic data recorded between 2005-2011 along road-transects by citizen scientists as part of the Indicator Bats Programme (iBats) [7]. The acoustic devices used were set to record using a time-expanded (TE) factor of 10, a sampling time of 320ms, and sensitivity set on maximum. This resulted in a continuous sequence of 'snapshots', consisting of 320ms of silence (sensor listening) and 3.2s of TE audio (sensor playing back x 10). The recorded audio data contained many instances of low amplitude and faint bat calls, as well as other night-time ‘background’ noises such as other biotic, abiotic, and anthropogenic sounds.

In this particular study, the data collection was done through surveys conducted by citizen scientists using acoustic devices. These devices were set up to record audio data using specific parameters such as TE factor, sampling time, and sensitivity. This approach allowed for the collection of a large amount of data, including faint bat calls and other background noises, which were used for training the BatDetect CNNs.

It is important to note that the provided context focuses mainly on the specific dataset and data collection process used in the study, and it does not cover other possible methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. Other studies might use different data collection methods, such as using public datasets, pre-existing datasets, or collecting data through sensors or other means.

In summary, the raw data for the deep learning pipeline in the study was collected through surveys conducted by citizen scientists using acoustic devices with specific recording parameters. However, other methods for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline may include using public datasets, pre-existing datasets, or collecting data through sensors or other means.
