Answer:

After training the machine learning models using Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and LightGBM, the postprocessing steps involved include the calculation of various metrics, such as the loss function (mean squared error), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2), to evaluate the performance of the algorithms. Additionally, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values were used to understand the model and explain the output of the machine learning models.

SHAP values are a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. SHAP values provide a way to fairly distribute the prediction among the input features, allowing for the interpretation of the impact of each feature on the prediction. In this study, the average of the absolute SHAP values for each input variable was calculated to understand the importance of the daily average temperature on the first flowering and full blossom dates.

Furthermore, the first flowering and full blossom dates for each station and year were calculated using the optimized models. The root mean square error (RMSE) was then calculated for all observation sites to evaluate the overall performance of the optimized models, and the RMSE for each observation site was calculated to evaluate the performance of the models for each site.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after training the machine learning models include the calculation of various metrics, such as the loss function, mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination, as well as the use of SHAP values to understand the model and explain the output. The first flowering and full blossom dates were then calculated using the optimized models, and the root mean square error was calculated to evaluate the performance of the models.
