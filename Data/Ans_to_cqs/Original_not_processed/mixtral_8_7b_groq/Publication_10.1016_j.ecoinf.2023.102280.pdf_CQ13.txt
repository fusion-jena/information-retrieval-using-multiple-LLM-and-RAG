The pieces of context provided do not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model for audio denoising. However, they do mention that deep noise reduction methods often use a U-net architecture, which consists of an encoder and decoder section, and that transformer attention mechanisms have been successfully applied.

In general, hyperparameters for deep learning models can include learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, and the architecture of the model itself (e.g., number of layers, number of units in each layer). The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. The optimizer is the algorithm used to update the model's weights based on the gradient of the loss function. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.

For audio denoising, the learning rate and choice of optimizer will depend on the specific dataset and task. For example, a lower learning rate may be used for fine-tuning a model trained on a different dataset to avoid overfitting. The batch size and number of epochs will also depend on the size of the dataset and computational resources available.

In the context of deep noise reduction methods for audio, Xie et al. (2021) established a method that uses a U-net architecture with a convolutional encoder and decoder, and a transformer-based attention mechanism. However, the specific hyperparameters used in their model are not provided in the context.

Therefore, while the pieces of context provide information about the architecture of deep learning models used for audio denoising, they do not give specific information about the hyperparameters used.
