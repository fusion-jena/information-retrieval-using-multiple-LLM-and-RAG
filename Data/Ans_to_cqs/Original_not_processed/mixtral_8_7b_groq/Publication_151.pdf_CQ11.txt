Answer:::
The provided context does not give information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the training and testing of a deep learning model called DEPP (Deep Embedded Phylogenetic Placement) for phylogenetic tree placement. However, it does not mention where the data or code for this pipeline is stored or hosted. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
