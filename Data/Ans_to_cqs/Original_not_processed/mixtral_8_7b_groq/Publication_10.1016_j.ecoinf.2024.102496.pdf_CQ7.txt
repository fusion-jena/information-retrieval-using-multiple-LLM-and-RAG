Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context consists of several figures and excerpts from a study about an equitable nutrient reduction decision support tool for stormwater best management practices (BMPs). However, there is no mention of the data splitting criteria used in the deep learning model training process.

The study focuses on advancing equitable stormwater management by integrating best practices for nutrient removal and environmental justice. The researchers developed a framework that includes various BMPs, such as filters, wet ponds, and wetland detention, to reduce nutrient pollution in water bodies. They also created environmental justice indices based on racial/ethnicity, socioeconomic, and social vulnerability factors.

While the study provides valuable insights into equitable nutrient reduction and BMPs, it does not offer information on the data splitting criteria for deep learning model training. Therefore, I cannot answer this query without additional context or information.
