Based on the provided context, the specific type of deep learning model used is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). However, the text does not explicitly mention which hardware resources, such as GPUs or TPUs, were used for training this ANN.

The ANN model fitting process does mention the usage of the CARET package, which can utilize parallel processing to speed up computations. This might suggest that some form of hardware acceleration was employed, but it does not specifically confirm the use of GPUs or TPUs.

It is important to note that ANNs can be trained on CPUs; however, using GPUs or TPUs can significantly speed up the training process, especially for large and complex models or datasets. Given the popularity and widespread use of deep learning, it is plausible to assume that some form of hardware acceleration was used during the ANN training process. However, without explicit information in the context, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.
