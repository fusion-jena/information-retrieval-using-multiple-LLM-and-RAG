Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms, including deep learning, for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I will provide a general overview of common techniques used to address data bias in ML based on the related literature.

One common technique to address data bias is stratified sampling, which involves dividing the dataset into subgroups or strata based on certain criteria, such as class labels, and then ensuring that each stratum is proportionally represented in the training and testing datasets. This method can help ensure that the model is trained on a diverse and representative sample of the data.

Another technique is oversampling, which involves increasing the number of instances in the minority class to balance the dataset. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class. However, oversampling can lead to overfitting, where the model becomes too specialized to the training data and performs poorly on new data.

Undersampling, on the other hand, involves reducing the number of instances in the majority class to balance the dataset. This method can help prevent overfitting, but it can also lead to loss of information and decreased model performance.

Diverse data collection is another technique to address data bias. This involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards a particular subset of the data.

In the context of LULC classification, the provided text mentions that the authors "reduced sampling bias by considering all the land use/land cover classes, and equally centered and scaled the predictor variables" (Khatami and Mountrakis, 2016). This suggests that they used a combination of stratified sampling and diverse data collection to address data bias.

In summary, common techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. However, the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques in the context of deep learning for LULC classification.
