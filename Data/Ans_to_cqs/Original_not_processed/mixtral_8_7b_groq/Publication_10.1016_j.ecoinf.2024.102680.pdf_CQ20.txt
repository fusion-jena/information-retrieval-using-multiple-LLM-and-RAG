Answer:::

The deep learning model in the experiment is trained using a GPU, specifically an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080. This is mentioned in the context when describing the experimental environment. The use of a GPU for training deep learning models is common due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which is particularly useful for the matrix and vector operations that are prevalent in deep learning algorithms. GPUs can significantly speed up the training process compared to using only a CPU. Other hardware resources such as TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) can also be used for training deep learning models, but the context does not mention the use of TPUs in this particular experiment.
