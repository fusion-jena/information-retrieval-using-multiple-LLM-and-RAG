Answer:::

The text provided does not give specific details about how the raw data was collected in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data was collected using sensors, as the study evaluates the process of constructing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNs) from large-scale acoustic data, which includes approximately one million minutes of audio recordings from 23 different sites in Bochum, Germany.

Additionally, the authors describe the necessary steps of constructing CNs from the data, which suggests that the data was collected and processed in a systematic and standardized way. The data was then analyzed using various methods, including sound event classification using machine learning approaches and psychoacoustic analysis.

It is also mentioned that the data comes from 23 different sites, which implies that the data was collected from multiple locations, possibly using a network of sensors. However, the specific details of the data collection process are not provided in the text.

Therefore, while it can be inferred that the data was collected using sensors, the specific methods used for data collection are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
