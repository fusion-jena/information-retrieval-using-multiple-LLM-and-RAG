Answer:::
The provided context does not give information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It mainly focuses on the methodology and architecture of the model used for deer survey from drone thermal imagery. Different ResNet models with FPN (Feature Pyramid Network) were used as feature map extractors, and a region proposal network was utilized to generate regions of interest (RoIs) of different sizes. These RoIs were then assigned to corresponding feature maps based on their resolutions. The outputs of these models were compared using figures 14 and 15. However, there is no mention of the platform used for deployment.
