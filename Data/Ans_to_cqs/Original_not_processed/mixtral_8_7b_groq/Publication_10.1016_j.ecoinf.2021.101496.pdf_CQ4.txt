The provided pieces of context do not directly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. However, some of the sources discuss the use of machine learning and artificial neural networks in different fields.

For instance, Kanani and Padole (2020) and Yildiz and Boyraz (2019) focus on solutions for medical applications using machine learning techniques. Mohr and Schopfer (2012) discuss plant physiology, while Nasir et al. (2019) present a fog computing-enabled cost-effective distributed summarization of surveillance videos for smart cities. Osroosh et al. (2018) introduce an economical thermal-RGB imaging system for monitoring agricultural crops. Nelis et al. (2020) explore smartphone-based optical assays in the food safety field. Pagnutti et al. (n.d.) investigate the use of machine learning for predicting SPAD values in plants.

In the context of Pagnutti et al. (n.d.), they implemented an artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting SPAD values based on Rasp2SPAD indices. Although the text does not explicitly mention data augmentation techniques, it is common practice in deep learning pipelines to apply data augmentation techniques to improve model performance and prevent overfitting. Common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, and scaling images or other forms of data.

Flipping refers to horizontally or vertically flipping the input data, which can help the model generalize better and be more robust to variations in input data. Rotating the input data can simulate different viewpoints or orientations of the object being analyzed. Scaling the input data can help the model handle different sizes or resolutions of the input data.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, it is reasonable to assume that data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling were applied when implementing the artificial neural network in Pagnutti et al. (n.d.). However, this is an assumption based on common practice in deep learning pipelines, and the text does not provide explicit confirmation of this.
