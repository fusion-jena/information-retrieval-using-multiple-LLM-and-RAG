Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models for semantic segmentation of satellite imagery, specifically for the classification of vegetation in the Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado). However, it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models.

In general, preprocessing data before training deep learning models can include various steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization typically involves rescaling the data to a range of values, often between 0 and 1, to improve the training process. Scaling can refer to adjusting the range of values, such as standardizing data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Cleaning data can involve removing or correcting errors, such as missing or incorrect values.

In the context of satellite imagery, preprocessing can include additional steps such as atmospheric correction, geometric correction, and radiometric calibration. Atmospheric correction can help account for the effects of the Earth's atmosphere on the recorded reflectance values. Geometric correction can involve adjusting the image to align with a known coordinate system. Radiometric calibration can help ensure that the recorded reflectance values are accurate and consistent.

In the specific context of training a deep learning model for semantic segmentation of satellite imagery, preprocessing can also involve creating training samples from the raw imagery. This can involve extracting patches from the image, labeling the pixels within each patch with the appropriate class, and splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models, it is likely that some or all of the above preprocessing steps were taken.
