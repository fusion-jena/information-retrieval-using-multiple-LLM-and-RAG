Answer:::

The provided context discusses the evaluation of machine learning models for species distribution prediction, but it does not specify the use of deep learning models. However, it does mention several metrics used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models.

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models include Area Under the Curve (AUC), True Skill Statistics (TSS), Cohen's KAPPA, point-biserial correlation (COR), and Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC).

The Area Under the Curve (AUC) measures the model's ability to distinguish between true positive and false positive rates. AUC values range from 0 to 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates better performance.

True Skill Statistics (TSS) is a threshold-dependent measure that evaluates the performance of binary classifiers. TSS values range from -1 to 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates better performance.

Cohen's KAPPA is a measure of agreement between predicted and observed values. KAPPA values range from -1 to 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates better performance.

Point-biserial correlation (COR) measures the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables, where one variable is binary. COR values range from -1 to 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates a stronger positive relationship.

Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) is a plot of the true positive rate against the false positive rate. The ROC curve provides a visual representation of the model's performance, and the area under the curve (AUC) is a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between true positive and false positive rates.

Therefore, while the provided context does not specifically mention the use of deep learning models, it does mention several metrics used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models, including AUC, TSS, KAPPA, COR, and ROC.
