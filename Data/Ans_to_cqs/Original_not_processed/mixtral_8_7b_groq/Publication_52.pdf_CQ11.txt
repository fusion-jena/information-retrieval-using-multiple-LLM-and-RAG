Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text describes the methodology and techniques used for marine species identification through machine hearing and extreme deep learning, but it does not mention where the data used in the study is stored or how it can be accessed. The data repository link, if available, is typically provided in the article or in the journal's website, but it is not the case in this instance. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
