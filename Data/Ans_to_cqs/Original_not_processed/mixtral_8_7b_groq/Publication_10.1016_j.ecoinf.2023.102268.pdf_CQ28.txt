Based on the provided context, there is no information given about which platform or cloud service was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text mentions the use of specific deep learning models, such as ResNet-50, and machine learning techniques, like support vector machines (SVM), but it does not mention any cloud platforms. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
