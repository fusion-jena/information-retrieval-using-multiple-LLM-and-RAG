Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in the context provided utilizes the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer for training the models. Specifically, the SGD optimizer is used in the training process of a depth-attention YOLOv5 model. The learning rate for this optimizer is set to an initial value of 0.01 and a cycle learning rate of 0.2.

In addition to the SGD optimizer, the training process incorporates techniques to prevent underfitting. This is achieved by ensuring that all models follow back-propagation after accumulating the batch size 32 times, even though the maximum batch size is limited to 4 during model training.

It is important to note that no other optimization techniques, such as Adam or RMSprop, are explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, based on the given information, the only optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline is the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer.
