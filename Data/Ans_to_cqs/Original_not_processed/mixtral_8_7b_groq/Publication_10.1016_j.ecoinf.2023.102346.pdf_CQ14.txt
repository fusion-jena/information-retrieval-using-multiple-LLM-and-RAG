Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. However, it does mention that eight different machine learning algorithms were tested for generating predictive models, and an ensemble modeling approach was implemented. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves testing a grid of predefined hyperparameter values, while random search randomly selects hyperparameter values to test. Bayesian optimization uses a Bayesian model to make informed decisions about which hyperparameters to test next. It is possible that one or more of these methods were used for hyperparameter optimization, but the context does not provide enough information to make a definitive statement. Additionally, the specific algorithms used may have their own built-in methods for hyperparameter optimization.
