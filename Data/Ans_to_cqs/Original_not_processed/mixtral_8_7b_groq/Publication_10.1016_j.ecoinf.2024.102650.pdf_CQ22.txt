Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of the ERNIE model, a deep learning model for natural language processing tasks, particularly for emotional analysis. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance.

Common evaluation metrics for deep learning models in classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions. Precision calculates the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions. Recall determines the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced assessment of both.

In the context of the given text, the ERNIE model's performance is evaluated based on test results from various Chinese tasks and a mixed-language emotional analysis task at the International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation 2020. However, specific evaluation metrics are not provided.

To answer the query specifically, the context does not offer enough information on the evaluation metrics used for the ERNIE model.
