Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the active learning pipeline for crop classification. However, it does mention that the classifier achieves 93.2% overall accuracy after the first 30,000 active queries, which suggests that the training process involves a certain number of queries or iterations.

In general, training of machine learning models is often considered complete when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly, indicating that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data and is not overfitting. This is typically achieved through early stopping, where training is halted when the validation loss does not improve for a certain number of epochs.

The context also mentions the use of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm, which is an iterative algorithm used to optimize the model parameters by taking one step toward the minimum loss value at each iteration. The training process may involve multiple passes over the training data, with the SGD algorithm applied many times until the validation loss plateaus or other convergence criteria are met.

Overall, while the provided context does not give specific details about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the active learning pipeline for crop classification, it is common practice to use convergence criteria such as validation loss plateau or early stopping in machine learning training processes.
