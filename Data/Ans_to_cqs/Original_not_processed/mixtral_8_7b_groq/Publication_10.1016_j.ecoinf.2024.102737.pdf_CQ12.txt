Answer:::
The deep learning model used in the pipeline mentioned is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context that states the performance of a fine-tuned CNN was compared with traditional classification methods such as SVM, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Sparse Representation Classifier. The CNN outperformed these traditional methods with an average classification rate of more than 90% on the LifeCLEF14 and LifeCLEF15 fish datasets. Furthermore, another study reached a classification accuracy of 94.3% using a very deep CNN with a cross-layer pooling approach for handling the limited labeled training data problem. However, the pipeline does not only consist of a CNN but also includes a Siamese network, which is a type of neural network architecture containing two or more identical subnetworks. In this case, the Siamese networks have either 2 or 4 convolution layers with Relu activations and Contrastive Loss as a loss function. These Siamese networks are used to learn a similarity function, which is better for learning with a small example set.
