The provided context does not include information about the deep learning model or the metrics used to evaluate its performance. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to the query.

However, I can provide some general information about the performance metrics commonly used to evaluate deep learning models.

Deep learning models can be evaluated using various metrics, depending on the specific task and the nature of the data. Here are some commonly used metrics:

1. Accuracy: Accuracy is the most common metric used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. It is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. However, accuracy may not be a reliable metric when the dataset is imbalanced, i.e., the number of samples in each class is not equal.
2. Precision: Precision is the ratio of true positives (correctly predicted positive samples) to the total number of positive predictions. It measures the proportion of relevant instances among the retrieved instances.
3. Recall: Recall is the ratio of true positives to the total number of actual positive samples. It measures the proportion of relevant instances that were retrieved.
4. F1-score: F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It is a more balanced metric than accuracy, especially when the dataset is imbalanced.
5. Mean Squared Error (MSE): MSE is commonly used to evaluate regression models. It measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
6. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): MAE is another metric used to evaluate regression models. It measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values.
7. Area Under the Curve (AUC): AUC is a metric used to evaluate binary classification models. It measures the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, which plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate.

These are just a few of the many metrics used to evaluate deep learning models. The choice of metric depends on the specific task, the nature of the data, and the business objective.
