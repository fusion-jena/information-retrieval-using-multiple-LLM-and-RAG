Answer:::

The provided context does not contain specific information about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. However, it is common in deep learning applications to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to accelerate the training process due to their ability to perform parallel computations. GPUs and TPUs can handle large matrix operations and are particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data, as is often the case in deep learning. Therefore, while not explicitly stated in the given context, it is reasonable to assume that GPUs or TPUs would be used for training a deep learning model in the context of species distribution modeling or human-wildlife conflict analysis.
