Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in the study is to classify fish species from different families using DNA barcode sequences. The model, named ESK, combines Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to improve the classification accuracy. The EN-SAE model is used to learn the deep features of the DNA barcode sequences and obtain the outgroup score of each fish. Then, KDE is used to select a threshold based on the outgroup scores and classify the fish into different families. The high dimensionality of DNA barcode sequences and the limitation of the number of fish species make it difficult to analyze the DNA sequences and classify the fish correctly. The ESK model proposed in the study aims to solve this problem by preprocessing the original data from DNA barcode sequences, learning the deep features using EN-SAE, and classifying the fish using KDE. The use of Elastic Net in the EN-SAE model helps to solve the overfitting problem in training on small datasets and improve the generalization ability of the model. Additionally, Elastic Net provides sparse connections, which can save training time by reducing the number of genetic characteristics that need to be analyzed.
