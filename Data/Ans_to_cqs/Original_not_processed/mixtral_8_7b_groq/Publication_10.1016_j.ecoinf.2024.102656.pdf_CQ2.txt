The provided context does not give a direct answer to the query regarding the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images and raster data in the analysis.

The Landsat 8 OLI images are captured in 2019 at a spatial resolution of 30 m and are used to derive vegetation variables using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). These vegetation variables are then formatted as raster data with a grid size of 100 m in ArcGIS v.10.4.

Additionally, distance maps for mines, mining roads, settlements, and protected areas (CAs) are generated and formatted as raster data. These distance maps are used to incorporate human influences and represent landscape-level safety and forage resources.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the data formats used in the analysis include raster data and image data (Landsat 8 OLI images). However, the context does not mention the use of other data formats such as audio or video.
