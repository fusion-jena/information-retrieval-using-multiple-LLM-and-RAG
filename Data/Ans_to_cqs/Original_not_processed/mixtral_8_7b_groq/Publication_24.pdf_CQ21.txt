Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there are no specific details mentioned about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, we can infer some information from the given text.

The authors mention the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Deep learning models for urban ecoacoustic assessment. Typically, after training a CNN, several postprocessing steps can be involved. These may include:

1. Metrics calculation: This involves calculating various evaluation metrics to assess the performance of the model. Commonly used metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
2. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It can be used to calculate the above-mentioned evaluation metrics.
3. Visualization techniques: Visualization techniques, such as Saliency maps, can be used to gain insights into the model's decision-making process. Saliency maps highlight the important features in the input data that the model used to make its prediction.

In the context of the given article, the authors mention the use of a pretrained model for bulbul and evaluating its performance on the CitySounds2017test dataset. They also compare the performance of CityBioNet with bulbul in terms of precision, recall, and F1-score. Therefore, it can be inferred that the authors calculated these evaluation metrics as part of their postprocessing steps. However, there is no explicit mention of other visualization techniques, such as Saliency maps, being used.
