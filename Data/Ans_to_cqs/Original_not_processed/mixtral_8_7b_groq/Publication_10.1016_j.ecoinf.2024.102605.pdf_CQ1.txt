Answer:::

The methods utilized for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines include surveys, sensors, and public datasets. In the contexts provided, most of the data collection is done through sensors.

For instance, Bo et al. (2022) used multi-source data with machine learning to improve water status prediction of winter wheat. The multi-source data included ground-based spectral measurements, meteorological data, and remote sensing data. Ground-based spectral measurements were taken using sensors, while meteorological data and remote sensing data were obtained from public datasets.

Baath et al. (2021) detected biophysical characteristics and nitrogen status of finger millet at hyperspectral and multispectral resolutions. They used hyperspectral and multispectral sensors to collect the data.

Bingtao et al. (2023) used a hyperspectral UAV image to detect dendroctonus valens infestation at tree level. Here, a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) equipped with a hyperspectral sensor was used to collect the data.

Calder√≥n et al. (2013) used high-resolution airborne hyperspectral and thermal imagery for early detection of Verticillium wilt of olive using fluorescence, temperature, and narrow-band spectral indices. They used airborne hyperspectral and thermal sensors to collect the data.

Binxiang et al. (2022) used a Sentinel-2-based triangular vegetation index for chlorophyll content estimation. Sentinel-2 is a European Space Agency (ESA) Earth observation mission that provides high-resolution optical imagery.

In some cases, data is collected through surveys. For example, Broge and Leblanc (2001) compared the prediction power and stability of broadband and hyperspectral vegetation indices for estimation of green leaf area index and canopy chlorophyll density. They collected data through ground surveys using a spectroradiometer.

Public datasets are also a significant source of data. Zhang et al. (2024) used data from the Ecological Informatics journal for their studies. However, the specific method of data collection is not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, it can be concluded that while public datasets are a source of data, most of the raw data in deep learning pipelines is collected through sensors, including ground-based sensors, airborne and satellite sensors, and UAVs equipped with sensors. Surveys are another method of data collection, although they are less commonly used.
