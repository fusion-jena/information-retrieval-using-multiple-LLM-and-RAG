Answer:::

The provided context discusses a study that uses deep learning models to predict animal behavior, specifically diving in seabirds, using GPS track data. However, the text does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

The authors do mention that they used GPS track data from 18 individuals for each of the three seabird species studied, resulting in a dataset of 54 individuals in total. They also used different combinations of the variables recorded solely by the GPS device, such as variation in longitude and latitude, altitude, and coverage ratio, to explore the qualities of different models.

However, the text does not mention whether the authors used techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer this query definitively.
