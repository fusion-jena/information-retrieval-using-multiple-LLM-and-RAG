Answer:::

I am unable to provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline because there is no information provided in the context that suggests the creation or use of a deep learning pipeline, or any related code repository hosted on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The context consists of various scientific research studies and a mention of the GeNIe software program, but there is no connection to deep learning pipelines or code repositories.
