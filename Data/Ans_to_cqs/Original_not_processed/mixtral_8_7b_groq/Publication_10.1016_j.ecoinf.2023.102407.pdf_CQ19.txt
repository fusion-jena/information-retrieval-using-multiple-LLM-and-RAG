Answer:::

The provided context discusses various machine learning and deep learning frameworks, but it does not explicitly state which of these frameworks are used to build a deep learning model for a specific application. However, it does mention the use of PyTorch in the context of a study related to species distribution models (SDMs).

In the context, Pham et al. (2021) used PyTorch to develop a meta pseudo labeling (PL) method for SDMs. The authors used PyTorch to implement a teacher-student structure in the training process, where a trained teacher model is used to teach a student model. However, it is not clear if the teacher model itself is a deep learning model built using PyTorch or another framework.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of other machine learning frameworks such as Scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011), XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016), Lightgbm (Ke et al., 2017), and Pygam (Serv√©n and Brummitt, 2018). These frameworks are commonly used for machine learning tasks, but they are not typically used for deep learning.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can conclude that PyTorch is a framework used in the development of deep learning models, and it is mentioned in the context in relation to a study on SDMs. However, the context does not provide enough information to determine if PyTorch was used to build the deep learning model for that study or if it was used for another purpose.
