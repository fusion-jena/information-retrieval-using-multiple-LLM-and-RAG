Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository for it on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The text focuses on the application of various models, including XGBoost and RBF-GFR-RF, to ecological datasets. It discusses the performance of these models, but it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested location of the code repository.
