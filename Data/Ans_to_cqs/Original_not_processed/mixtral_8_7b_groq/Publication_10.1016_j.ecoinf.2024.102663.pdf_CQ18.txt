Answer:::
While the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy used to monitor model performance during training, it does offer insights into how model performance was evaluated after training. This can give us a general idea of the possible strategies that might have been employed.

The context discusses several performance metrics for each model, including training time, prediction time, variance, R2 score, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics are commonly used to assess the quality of a model's fit and its predictive capabilities. Therefore, it's reasonable to infer that the strategy likely involved calculating these metrics after each model had completed its training phase.

For instance, the training time and prediction time provide information about the computational efficiency of the models. A shorter training time is generally desirable, but not at the expense of model performance. The R2 score, which measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables, gives an indication of how well the model fits the data. A higher R2 score indicates a better fit.

Variance, on the other hand, is a measure of how much the output of a model would change if it was trained on a different subset of the data. High variance can indicate overfitting, where the model has learned the training data too well and performs poorly on unseen data. MAE, or Mean Absolute Error, measures the average magnitude of the errors made by the model. Lower MAE values indicate better performance.

In addition, the MAE/R2 ratio is calculated, which can be useful for comparing models with different R2 scores. This ratio gives a standardized measure of error that allows models with different R2 scores to be compared directly.

Therefore, while the exact strategy for monitoring performance during training is not specified, it's clear that various performance metrics were calculated after training to assess the quality of the models.
