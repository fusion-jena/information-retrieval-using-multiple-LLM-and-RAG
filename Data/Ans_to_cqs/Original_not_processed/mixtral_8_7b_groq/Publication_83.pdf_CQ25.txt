Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in the given context is bird sound classification. The model employs a deep learning architecture called SubSpectralNet to classify bird sounds. Experimental results show that fusing selected deep learning models can effectively increase the classification performance. The best fused model can achieve a balanced accuracy of 86.31% and a weighted F1-score of 93.31%. The feature learning part of the proposed model follows a VGG style network, which has been previously used for classifying acoustic scenes. The network is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10âˆ’4, and the categorical cross entropy is utilized as the loss function. The batch size is 64 samples, and the network is trained with 200 epochs. The input to the model is bird sound audio files, which have varying durations. Two methods are used to handle the varying length audio data: repeating the signal from the beginning to force a fixed duration of 2 seconds, or resizing the audio image to a fixed size.
