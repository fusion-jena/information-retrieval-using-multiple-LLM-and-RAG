Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text does not mention any methods such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query. It is possible that the hyperparameter optimization process was not included in the scope of the text, or it may be described in a different part of the source material that was not provided.
