Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a specific data repository link where the results of such a pipeline could be found. The text focuses on the process of data mining, specifically in the context of water body pollution in Puglia, and discusses the steps involved in the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process. This includes identifying the aim of a study, pre-selecting useful data, making analytical determinations, and optimizing and elaborating the obtained results. The support parameter, which measures the abundance or frequency of a set of items in a database, is discussed as a measure of association values to explain data mining results.

However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link for this pipeline. It is possible that such a pipeline was not used in this study, or that the results were not made available in a public repository. Without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
