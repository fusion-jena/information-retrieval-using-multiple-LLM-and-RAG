Answer:::

The raw data used in the deep learning pipeline is collected through the iNaturalist platform, which is a citizen science project where users can upload plant photographs from all over the world. This information is then utilized to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the purpose of extracting plant functional traits from the images. Additionally, the study also utilized bioclimatic data from the 'Worldclim' dataset, which was fed into the CNN along with the iNaturalist data. The authors also tested an Ensemble approach, where they trained two more state-of-the-art model architectures, Xception51 and MobileNetV2, on the same configuration of setup 3, and their predictions were subsequently averaged. These models differed in their number of trainable weights, resulting in a different depth. The final model performance was assessed using a 3-fold cross-validation, with three different training, validation and test splits.

It is important to note that the raw data used in this study is not collected through surveys or sensors, but rather through a public dataset provided by a citizen science project. The authors exploited the potential of Big Data provided by professional and citizen science alike, and harnessed the exponentially growing iNaturalist database to alleviate the problem of limited data that still impedes us to picture global gradients.

In summary, the raw data used in the deep learning pipeline is collected through the iNaturalist platform, a citizen science project where users can upload plant photographs from all over the world. Additionally, bioclimatic data from the 'Worldclim' dataset is also used. The authors tested an Ensemble approach using two more state-of-the-art model architectures, Xception51 and MobileNetV2, and assessed the final model performance using a 3-fold cross-validation.
