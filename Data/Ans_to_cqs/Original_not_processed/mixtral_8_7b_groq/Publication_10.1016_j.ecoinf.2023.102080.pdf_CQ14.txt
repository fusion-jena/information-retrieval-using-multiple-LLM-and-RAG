Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information on how the hyperparameters of the models are optimized. It mentions the use of three different algorithms for model fitting, which are Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), and Random Forest (RF). However, it does not specify the method used for hyperparameter optimization.

The two-step "embedded" covariate selection procedure introduced in the study combines a collinearity-filtering algorithm with three model-specific embedded regularization techniques. These techniques include GLM with elastic net regularization, GAM with null-space penalization, and guided regularized RF. The R packages and hyperparameter values used for fitting these algorithms are provided in Supplementary material 1: Text S1. However, the method used for hyperparameter optimization is not mentioned.

The models' accuracy is evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC), the maximized True Skill Statistic (maxTSS), the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI), and their average "Score" value obtained through a split-sample strategy repeated 100 times with 30% of the data kept aside for validation. However, there is no information on how the hyperparameters of the models are optimized to achieve these accuracy metrics.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding how the hyperparameters of the models are optimized.
