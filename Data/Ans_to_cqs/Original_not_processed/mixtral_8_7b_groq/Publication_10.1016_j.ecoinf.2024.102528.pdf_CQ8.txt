Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipelines used in the studies. The articles and reports mention various deep learning models and techniques, such as the ResNet model used in He et al., 2016 and the BirdNET algorithm used in Kahl et al., 2021 and Wood et al., 2022, but they do not specify where the code for these models can be found. It is possible that the authors have not made the code publicly available, or it may be hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
