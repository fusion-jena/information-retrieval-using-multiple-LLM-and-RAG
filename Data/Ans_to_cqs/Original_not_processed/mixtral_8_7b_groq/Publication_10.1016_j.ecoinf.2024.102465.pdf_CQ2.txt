Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline in the study described uses image data as its primary format. This is evident from the employment of the HRNet model for semantic segmentation, which is performed on social media image data. The image data is processed in PyCharm software, and further refined with the assistance of graphics processing software. The resulting semantic segmentation provides the necessary information for calculating various environmental indicators, such as greenness, openness, and ground exposure, all of which are derived from image data.

Although the main focus is on image data, there is also a mention of utilizing NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques for scoring text content in social media data. However, the specific data format for this NLP model is not explicitly stated. Given that the NLP model is used to score text content from social media platforms, it can be inferred that the data format is likely to be text-based, such as CSV or JSON, which are common formats for storing and processing textual data.

To summarize, the deep learning pipeline in this study primarily works with image data, using the HRNet model for semantic segmentation. Additionally, there is an NLP model involved, which likely processes textual data, although the specific data format is not explicitly mentioned.
