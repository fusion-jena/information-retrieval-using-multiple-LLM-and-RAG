Answer:::
While the provided context does not include specific preprocessing steps for the training of deep learning models, it is common practice to perform certain preprocessing techniques such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

Normalization is a process that scales the input data to a range that is suitable for the deep learning model. This can be done by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the input data. This technique is often used for features with different scales or units.

Scaling is another preprocessing technique that resizes the input data to a specific range, often between 0 and 1. This can help the model converge faster during training and improve its performance.

Cleaning refers to the process of removing or correcting erroneous or missing data points. This can include imputation of missing values, removal of outliers, or correction of inconsistent data.

In the context of Table 1, it can be inferred that the input size of each image is preprocessed to 224 x 224 pixels for ResNet-50, ViT-S/16, and VecEnsemble (Ours), while it is 256 x 256 pixels for Volo-d1 and MatEnsemble (Ours). However, the specific preprocessing techniques used are not mentioned.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, it is common practice to perform normalization, scaling, and cleaning as part of the preprocessing pipeline.
