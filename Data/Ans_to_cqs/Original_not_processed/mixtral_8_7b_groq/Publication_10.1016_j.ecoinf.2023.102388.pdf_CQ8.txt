Based on the information provided, there is no specific code repository mentioned for the deep learning pipeline used in the context of Villon and collaborators' article or the VGG16 training process. However, there are a few code repositories and resources mentioned that could potentially be related to the broader topic of deep learning for image recognition and marine life monitoring.

One such repository is "Make Sense" by Skalski, P., which is a deep learning tool for image classification and object detection (<https://github.com/SkalskiP/make-sense/>). While it is not explicitly mentioned in the context, it could be a useful resource for those interested in deep learning for image recognition.

Another repository related to deep learning and image recognition is the one by Song, L., Shokri, R., and Mittal, P., which focuses on membership inference attacks against adversarially robust deep learning models (<https://doi.org/10.1109/SPW.2019.00021>).

Furthermore, the VGG16 architecture is a well-known convolutional neural network (CNN) model that has been widely used for image recognition tasks. There are several open-source implementations of VGG16 available on platforms such as GitHub, including the one by Keras (<https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/keras/applications/vgg16.py>).

Therefore, while there is no specific code repository mentioned for the deep learning pipeline used in the context, there are several related repositories and resources available for those interested in deep learning for image recognition and marine life monitoring.
