Answer:::

The provided context discusses the training of a specific type of machine learning model, Random Forest (RF), for predicting algal-related parameters such as chlorophyll-a in the context of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) monitoring. However, it does not directly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into sets like train, test, and validation.

However, it does mention that 80% of the data was used for model training, and the remaining 20% was used for validation and hyperparameter optimization. This suggests that the data was split into two sets: a training set and a validation/tuning set.

In general, for deep learning models, it is common to split the data into three sets: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used during the model training phase to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model.

The context also discusses the use of high-frequency datasets and manually sampled datasets for training the RF model. It is possible that these datasets were used to create a more diverse training set, which can help improve the model's performance.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of an optimization algorithm, Optuna, for hyperparameter optimization. This algorithm automatically searches the hyperparameter space for the greatest combination of hyperparameters that minimizes the mean squared error. This process of hyperparameter tuning can be done using a validation set.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it suggests that the data was split into a training set and a validation/tuning set. Additionally, it is common practice in deep learning to split the data into three sets: a training set, a validation set, and a test set.
