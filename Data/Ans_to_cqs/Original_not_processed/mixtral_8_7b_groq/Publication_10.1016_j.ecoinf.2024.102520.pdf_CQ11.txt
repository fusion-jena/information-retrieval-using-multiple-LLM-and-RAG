Answer:::

I am unable to provide the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline because there is no information provided in the context about a deep learning pipeline or any data repository links. The context consists of several research papers and articles related to various topics such as soil substrates, land use and land cover studies, soil sampling and analysis, Himalayan microbiomes, and cognitive sensor systems. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or any data repository links associated with it. I recommend checking the relevant research papers or articles for the data repository link or contacting the authors directly for more information.
