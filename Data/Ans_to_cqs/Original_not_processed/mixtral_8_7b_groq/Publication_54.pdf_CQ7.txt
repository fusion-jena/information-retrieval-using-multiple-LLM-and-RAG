Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, as described in the given context, involve dividing the endemic bird data into three sets: training, testing, and validation. The training set consists of 3,132 images, while the testing set contains 760 images. This initial split is further augmented for the training set by creating 10 additional copies of each image, resulting in a total of 31,320 training images. This augmentation helps the deep networks converge and improves the model's ability to generalize.

After augmentation, the training set consists of 25,056 images (80% of the total), and the remaining 6,264 images are used for validation (20% of the total). The Inception-ResNet-v2 model is then trained using the mini-batch gradient descent algorithm with a batch size of 32 and a learning rate of 0.0001. The Adam optimizer is employed for fine-tuning the model.

It is important to note that the data splitting process aims to provide a balanced representation of the data for both training and validation purposes. The training set is used to fit the classifier's parameters, while the validation set offers an unbiased evaluation of the model fit on the training set during the tuning of model hyperparameters. These hyperparameters include the network layer size, determining the optimal number of hidden units, and regularizing the model.

In summary, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training involve dividing the data into training, testing, and validation sets. The training set is augmented to improve convergence and generalization, and the validation set is used for unbiased evaluation during hyperparameter tuning.
