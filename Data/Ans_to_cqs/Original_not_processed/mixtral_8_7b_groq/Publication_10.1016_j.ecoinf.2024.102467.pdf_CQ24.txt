The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does discuss two neural network architectures, BoTNet and EfficientNetV2, which employ strategies to optimize memory and computational resources during training.

BoTNet uses a bottleneck transformer structure, which combines self-attention and convolution to reduce network depth and improve performance. Specifically, BoTNet replaces the 3 Ã— 3 spatial convolutions in ResNet's last three bottleneck blocks with multi-head self-attention (MHSA). This integration of self-attention allows for the efficient capture of global information, reducing the need for stacking multiple convolutional layers. Importantly, the memory and computational requirements for self-attention are quadratic in the spatial dimension, so this strategy can help manage computational resources during training.

EfficientNetV2 is an efficient, lightweight feature extraction network that aims to reduce the number of parameters and computations while preserving accuracy. It uses an improved progressive learning approach that dynamically adjusts the regularization method based on the training image size. This method can improve training speed and accuracy, which may indirectly help manage randomness in the training process.

While these strategies do not directly address randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they do demonstrate how neural network architectures can be designed to optimize memory and computational resources during training. This can help ensure more stable and reliable training outcomes, which may be relevant for managing randomness in the training process. However, further research would be needed to determine the specific impact of these strategies on handling randomness in deep learning.
