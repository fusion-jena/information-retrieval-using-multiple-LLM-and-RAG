Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix after the model training. However, it is mentioned that for the final stage, 1,000 survey images were counted using the trained model. The data included the number of wildebeest counted by each user, their username, and the pixel location of each of their identifications.

Before analysis, any count data made using early versions of the counting interface or collected by either developers or citizen scientists were filtered out. For each of the 20,000 training images, the bounding boxes were manually checked and corrected.

Additionally, the deviation of each counting method (citizen science and YOLO) from the single expert count was calculated, which could be considered as a metric. However, it is not explicitly mentioned as a postprocessing step.

Therefore, based on the given context, the postprocessing steps after the model training are not clearly specified.
