Answer: The text states that the dataset used in the study is self-defined and contains only one category, which presents challenges during model training such as overfitting, assessing the model's generalization ability, and uneven data distribution affecting prediction rates. To address these issues, the dataset was divided into five subsets using k-fold cross-validation. Each subset served as a validation set, while the remaining four subsets constituted the training set. The YOLOv7 detection model underwent five rounds of training and validation to assess its generalizability. This approach, where the five YOLOv7 models optimally used all the samples in the dataset, ensuring that each sample was trained and validated in a different subset, yielded a prediction rate closer to 1. Therefore, k-fold cross-validation was used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
