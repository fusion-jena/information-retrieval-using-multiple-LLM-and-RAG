Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are no specific details about post-processing steps such as Saliency maps or Confusion matrices after model training. However, the text does mention the calculation of several statistical metrics for model evaluation.

In the context, eight machine learning models were trained and their performance was evaluated using several statistical measures. These measures include the coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Model Efficiency (MEF), Z statistics, Taylor statistics, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics were calculated for both the training and testing datasets.

The RMSE and MAE were also visualized in a figure for a clearer comparison of the models' performance. The figure shows that the Global Prediction Rate (GPR), Linear Regression (LR), Neural Network (NN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models had the lowest prediction errors during both the training and testing periods.

Therefore, while there is no explicit mention of post-processing steps like Saliency maps or Confusion matrices, the context does provide information about the calculation and interpretation of various statistical metrics for evaluating the performance of machine learning models.
