The provided context does not directly discuss data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. However, it does mention the use of species distribution models (SDMs) in the field of ecology, which can be a part of a deep learning pipeline. In the context of SDMs, the data annotation process typically involves labeling species occurrence data and environmental variables.

In the context, the authors use occurrence data and environmental variables to train a SDM. The occurrence data consists of 5,007,461 records, and environmental variables include 19 different features. These features are then classified into categories such as highly suitable habitat, suitable habitat, and marginally suitable habitat. This classification process can be considered a form of data annotation.

In general, for deep learning pipelines, data annotation techniques can include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image. It is commonly used for object detection tasks.
2. Semantic segmentation: In this method, each pixel in an image is assigned a class label. It is useful for tasks like scene understanding and image segmentation.
3. Instance segmentation: This technique combines object detection and semantic segmentation. Each instance of an object is segmented and assigned a class label.
4. Point annotation: In some cases, such as point cloud data, individual points are annotated with class labels or other attributes.

In the context, although the specific data annotation techniques are not mentioned, the authors use occurrence data and environmental variables to train a SDM, which can be a part of a deep learning pipeline. The data annotation process in this context involves categorizing environmental variables and species occurrence records.
