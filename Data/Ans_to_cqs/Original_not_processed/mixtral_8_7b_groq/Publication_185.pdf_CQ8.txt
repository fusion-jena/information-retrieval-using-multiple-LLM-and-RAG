Unfortunately, the context provided does not mention or give information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used for butterfly classification. The text focuses on the feasibility of using a small dataset to train deep learning models, specifically using the AlexNet architecture, for butterfly classification in the context of biodiversity conservation. It explains the process of training the model using stochastic gradient descent and the backpropagation algorithm included in Caffe. However, it does not provide information about where the code for this specific implementation might be found. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
