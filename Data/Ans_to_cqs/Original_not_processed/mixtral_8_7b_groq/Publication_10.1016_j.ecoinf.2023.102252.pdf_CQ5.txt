Based on the provided context, there is no information about any datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet being used in a deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on environmental flow, riparian ecosystem, wetland, and biodiversity maintenance. It discusses the importance of mapping environmental flows to ecological responses for effective environmental water management. The documents mentioned are related to the development of the Murray Darling Basin Plan and a literature review on ecological responses to altered flow regimes. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer regarding the deep learning pipeline datasets using the given context.
