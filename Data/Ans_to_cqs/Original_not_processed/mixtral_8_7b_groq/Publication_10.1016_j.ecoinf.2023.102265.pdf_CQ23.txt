Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated which measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that suggest that some steps were taken to ensure the model's performance on unseen data.

Firstly, the authors used a ResNet-50 model, which is a well-known and widely used deep learning architecture for image classification tasks. This model has been pre-trained on a large and diverse dataset (ImageNet), which can help improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Secondly, the authors conducted experiments on two different datasets: ALA data with natural backgrounds and ALA data with anthropogenic backgrounds. This suggests that the authors were aware of the potential for their model to overfit to a specific dataset and took steps to evaluate its performance on different types of data.

Thirdly, the authors compared the training times and validation accuracies of three different ResNet models (ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101) and found that ResNet-50 had a marginally higher validation accuracy. This suggests that the authors may have used cross-validation or some other form of model selection to choose the best model for their task.

Finally, the authors used a support vector machine (SVM) classifier after extracting features using the ResNet-50 model. This is a common approach in deep learning, where a simpler model is used for the final classification task after extracting features using a deep learning model. This can help improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Overall, while the provided context does not explicitly state which measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, there are some indications that suggest that the authors took steps to evaluate the model's performance on different types of data and chose the best model for their task.
