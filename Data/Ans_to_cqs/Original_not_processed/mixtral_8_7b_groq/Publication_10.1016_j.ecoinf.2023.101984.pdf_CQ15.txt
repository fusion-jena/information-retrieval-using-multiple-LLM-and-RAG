The provided context does not include information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the application of the MaxEnt model for species distribution modeling, specifically for Quercus pubescens Willd. and Quercus ilex subsp. ilex.

The MaxEnt model uses two techniques for determining variable contributions: percent contribution and permutation importance. The percent contribution calculates the increase in regularized gain for each variable during each iteration of the training algorithm. Permutation importance measures the impact of a variable on training presence by randomly permuting the data and reevaluating the model.

However, these techniques are not directly related to optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. SGD and Adam are optimization algorithms for updating the parameters of neural networks in deep learning.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot answer the query regarding the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
