Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific details about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline of YWnet. However, it is mentioned that YWnet utilizes a backbone network, convolutional layers, batch normalization layers, SiLU activation functions, and various feature fusion techniques such as the CRFPN, SPPF, and CBS block. These components are commonly used in deep learning models, but the optimization techniques employed during training are not specified.

Optimization techniques are essential for training deep learning models, as they help minimize the difference between predicted and actual values, also known as the loss function. Some popular optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam. Among these, Adam has gained popularity due to its adaptive learning rate, which is a combination of the advantages of Adagrad and RMSprop.

Considering YWnet is a deep learning model, it is highly likely that an optimization technique is used during training. However, without explicit information in the context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
