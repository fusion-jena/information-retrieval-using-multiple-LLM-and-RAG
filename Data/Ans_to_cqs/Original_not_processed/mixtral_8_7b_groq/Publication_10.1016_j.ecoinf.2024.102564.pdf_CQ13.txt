Based on the provided context, the deep learning model used is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), specifically a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with a hidden layer. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning techniques such as adjusting learning rates or optimizers, which are typically associated with deep learning models.

The context does mention that the activation functions tested were not specified, but the trainable parameters of the network are the weights associated with the linear combinations performed by each individual neuron.

Therefore, while the model described is a type of neural network, the context does not provide enough information to determine if it is a deep learning model or what specific hyperparameters were used.

Answer:::
The provided context does not contain enough information to determine the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer.
