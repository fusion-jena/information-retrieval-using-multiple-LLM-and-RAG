Answer:::
The provided context does not give detailed information about the deployment of the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that all programs are built using Python 3 and PyTorch. PyTorch is a popular open-source machine learning library that provides tools for building and training machine learning models. It also allows model serialization, which is the process of saving the trained model so that it can be used later for inference.

Moreover, the context mentions that the models are trained on specific datasets, such as COCO 2017train dataset for Mask R-CNN and Kinetics-400 dataset for ResNets. This suggests that the models are trained in a local environment, and after training, the models can be deployed to a target platform.

In addition, the context mentions that the models are trained for a certain number of epochs, and the learning rate is decreased every few epochs. This information can be useful for fine-tuning the model during deployment.

To summarize, while the context does not provide explicit details about the deployment process, it can be inferred that the models are built using PyTorch, which allows model serialization. The models are trained on specific datasets, and the training parameters are well-defined, which can be useful during deployment.
