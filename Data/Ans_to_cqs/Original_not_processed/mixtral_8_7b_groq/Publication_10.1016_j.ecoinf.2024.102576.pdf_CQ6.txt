Answer: The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models for land-cover classification, specifically the U-Net model, but it does not explicitly enumerate the preprocessing steps applied before training the model. However, based on general practices in deep learning and the information given, we can infer some preprocessing steps that were likely involved.

First, the creation of training data involved generating grid cells and extracting the PSI (Phenological State Index) from those cells. This suggests that some form of data extraction and transformation was performed. The resolution of the grid cells was chosen based on the training unit of the U-Net model, indicating a consideration for the model's input requirements.

Second, the use of the U-Net model, a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), implies that image normalization was likely carried out. Normalization is a common preprocessing step for CNNs to ensure that the input data has a similar scale, preventing some features from dominating the learning process. This could involve techniques such as min-max scaling or mean normalization.

Third, the context mentions the importance of labeling data for the U-Net model, which suggests that data labeling or annotation was done. This could involve assigning class labels to each grid cell or pixel in the training data.

However, the context does not mention other common preprocessing steps like data cleaning (removing or correcting erroneous data), augmentation (artificially increasing the dataset size through transformations), or feature engineering (creating new features from existing data). Therefore, we cannot confirm whether these steps were taken.

In summary, based on the provided context and general practices in deep learning, it is likely that data extraction, transformation, normalization, and labeling were performed as preprocessing steps before training the deep learning model. However, other common steps like data cleaning, augmentation, and feature engineering may have also been involved but are not mentioned in the context.
