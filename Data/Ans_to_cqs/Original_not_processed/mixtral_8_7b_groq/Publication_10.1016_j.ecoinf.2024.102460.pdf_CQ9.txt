After reviewing the provided context, I was unable to find information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The sources cited in the paper do not mention any specific data repository where the pipeline or related data can be found. Additionally, the acknowledgments, data availability, and conflict of interest statements do not provide any details about the data repository.

However, it is mentioned that the study used the GlobeLand30 global land cover data released by the China Centre for Basic Geographic Information. While this does not provide information about the deep learning pipeline, it may be a starting point for those interested in the data used in the study.

In conclusion, I cannot provide information on the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. I recommend contacting the authors for more information about the data and pipeline used in their research.
