Answer:::

The text provided gives context about a study that uses the Twitter API and the twarc2 library to access and handle tweets for the purpose of biodiversity observation. However, it does not mention any specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

The study does mention the use of textual information from tweets to obtain a training dataset, but it does not specify the use of this dataset for deep learning. Additionally, the study mentions the limitation of using exclusively textual information and the potential usefulness of an image recognition model, but it does not mention the implementation of such a model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
