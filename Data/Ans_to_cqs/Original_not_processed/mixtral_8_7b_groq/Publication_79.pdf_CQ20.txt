Answer:::
The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that deep learning techniques are used for classifying the Brazilian Savanna physiognomies (Neves et al.). Deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), often require significant computational power for training, which is typically provided by Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). GPUs are specialized hardware designed to accelerate graphical processing, but they are also well-suited for the matrix and vector operations used in deep learning. TPUs, on the other hand, are custom-built by Google for machine learning tasks and can provide even greater performance for large-scale deep learning tasks. Without specific information, it can be assumed that either GPUs or TPUs were used for training the deep learning model in this study.
