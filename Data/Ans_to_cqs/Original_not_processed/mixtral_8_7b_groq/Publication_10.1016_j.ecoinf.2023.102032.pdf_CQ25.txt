Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, the context from the article "Improving cloud detection with machine learning" suggests that the deep learning model is used for image classification. Specifically, it is used to classify different land use types in Sentinel-2 satellite images.

In the article "National wetland mapping using remote-sensing-derived environmental variables, archive field data, and artificial intelligence," the authors use a deep learning model for land cover classification, and specifically for mapping wetlands. They use a combination of remote sensing data, archive field data, and artificial intelligence to create a national wetland map.

Furthermore, the article "High-resolution earth observation data for assessing the impact of land system changes on wetland health in Kashmir Himalaya, India" also uses a deep learning model for image classification. The authors use high-resolution earth observation data to assess the impact of land system changes on wetland health. They use a deep learning model to classify different land use types and analyze the changes in land use over time.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is primarily used for image classification in the context of remote sensing and earth observation. However, the specific type of classification (e.g., binary, multi-class) is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
