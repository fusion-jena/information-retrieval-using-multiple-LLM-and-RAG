Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning in the classification of Landsat images for detecting invasive species, specifically Spartina alterniflora. However, it does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.

From the context, we can infer that the deep learning method is applied to Landsat images, which are remote sensing images. These images are likely provided in a raster format, which is a common format for geospatial data.

Additionally, the study mentions the use of phenological features as inputs to the deep learning method. These features are derived from the Landsat images using a method called Ppf-CM. The phenological features are likely provided in a tabular format, such as a CSV file.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can infer that the deep learning pipeline for Landsat image classification involves raster data (Landsat images) and potentially tabular data (phenological features). However, the context does not explicitly confirm other data formats such as audio or video.
