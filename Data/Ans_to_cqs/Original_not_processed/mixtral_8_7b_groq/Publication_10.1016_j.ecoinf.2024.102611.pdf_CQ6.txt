Answer:

Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to prepare the data. These steps can include normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

Normalization is the process of adjusting the values of the features in the dataset to a similar scale to improve the model's performance. This is because deep learning models are sensitive to the scale of the input features. In the context provided, Gao et al. (2021) input RGB plant images into a ResNet18 architecture, and the input image is subjected to a sequence of operations, including batch normalization. Batch normalization is a technique that normalizes the activations of the neurons in a layer for each mini-batch. It re-centers and re-scales the activations, so they have zero mean and unit variance, which helps the model converge faster and be more stable during training.

Scaling is another preprocessing step that involves resizing the input images to a specific size that the model can handle. In the context provided, Malik et al. (2022) collected image samples of five medicinal plants using a box model and preprocessed them by resizing. Resizing the images ensures that the input to the model is of a consistent size, which is necessary for the model to learn effectively.

Cleaning is the process of removing noise, outliers, or irrelevant information from the dataset. In the context provided, Malik et al. (2022) also preprocessed the image samples by segmentation. Segmentation is the process of separating the object of interest from the background or other objects in the image. By segmenting the image, the model can focus on the relevant features of the object, which improves the accuracy of the model.

In addition to these preprocessing steps, data augmentation is another technique used to increase the sample size and improve the model's performance. Data augmentation involves creating new samples by applying transformations such as rotation, translation, or flipping to the existing samples. In the context provided, Malik et al. (2022) used data augmentation to increase the sample size of the five medicinal plants.

Therefore, before training a deep learning model, it is essential to preprocess the data by normalizing, scaling, cleaning, and augmenting the data to improve the model's performance.
