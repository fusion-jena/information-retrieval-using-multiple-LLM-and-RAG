Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for bioacoustic research. However, it does mention the use of public datasets for training deep learning models. For instance, the BirdNET model was trained on a dataset consisting of around 1000 species of birds. Therefore, it can be inferred that public datasets are one source of raw data for deep learning in bioacoustics.

Additionally, the context mentions the analysis of vocalizations of various animal species, such as birds, bats, whales, gibbons, and indris. It is likely that the vocalizations of these animals were collected through field surveys, where researchers use various types of sensors to record animal sounds. For example, researchers might use microphones or audio recorders to capture bird songs or bat echolocation calls.

Therefore, while the context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for bioacoustic research, it can be inferred that public datasets and field surveys with sensors are likely sources of raw data.
