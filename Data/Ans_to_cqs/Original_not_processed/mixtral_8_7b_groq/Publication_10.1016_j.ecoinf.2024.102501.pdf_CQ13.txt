Answer:::
The provided context discusses the application of deep learning models for predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, but it does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the models. However, it does mention that various optimization algorithms, such as genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and multi-verse optimizer, have been used to optimize the parameters of different models.

For instance, Yan et al. (2019) used GA and PSO to optimize a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) for DO estimation, while Wu et al. (2018), Huan et al. (2020), Zhu et al. (2021), Huang et al. (2021), Cao et al. (2021b), and Liu et al. (2014) used PSO in combination with BPNN, GRU, LSTM, SVM, and support vector regression (SVR) for DO modeling. These optimization algorithms have been used to optimize hyperparameters such as the number of neurons in neural networks and error penalty factor in SVM.

In addition, Heddam et al. (2014a) used GRNN for modeling hourly DO at Klamath River, Oregon, USA, and AntanasijeviÂ´c (2019) used GRNN, MLPNN, and recurrent neural networks (RNN) for DO concentrations in the Danube River, North Serbia. Du (2018) combined RBFNN with the proportional integrated derivative algorithm to control the DO concentration in aviation tanks.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models for DO concentration prediction, it does suggest that various optimization algorithms have been used to optimize the parameters of different models. Commonly used hyperparameters in deep learning models include learning rate, batch size, number of layers, number of neurons, and optimizer. The choice of hyperparameters depends on the specific model and dataset used.
