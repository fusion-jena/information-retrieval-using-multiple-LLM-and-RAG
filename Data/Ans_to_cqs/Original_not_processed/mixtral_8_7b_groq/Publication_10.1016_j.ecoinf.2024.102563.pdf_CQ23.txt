Based on the given context, there is no direct information about the use of a deep learning model for land cover classification. However, I can provide information on the generalizability measures taken for other classifiers used in the studies.

In the studies mentioned, several methods were used to ensure the generalizability of the land cover classifiers, such as Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Random Forest (RF). These methods include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, and stratified splitting.

For instance, Lu et al. (2010) used QuickBird imagery for land cover classification in a complex urban-rural landscape. They mentioned that they used a diverse dataset, including different land cover classes, to ensure the generalizability of their classifiers.

In the study by Duan et al. (2024), they used multi-textural features with an optimal window size for land cover classification. They used cross-validation to assess the performance of their classifiers. Cross-validation is a technique used to estimate the skill of a machine learning model on unseen data. In this method, the original sample is partitioned into a number of subsets, and the model is trained on all but one of the subsets. The left-out subset is then used for testing the model. This process is repeated for each subset, and the overall performance of the model is estimated by averaging the results.

Moreover, Liu et al. (2019) used a graded proportion method of training sample selection for updating conventional soil maps. They mentioned that they used stratified splitting to divide the dataset into training and testing sets. Stratified splitting is a technique used to ensure that each class is represented proportionally in both the training and testing sets. This method helps to prevent bias in the classifiers and improves their generalizability.

In the study by Saboori et al. (2019), they combined multi-scale textural features from the panchromatic bands of high spatial resolution images with ANN and MLC classification algorithms to extract urban land uses. They used cross-validation to assess the performance of their classifiers.

In summary, while there is no direct information about the use of deep learning models for land cover classification, the studies mentioned used various methods to ensure the generalizability of their classifiers. These methods include using diverse datasets, cross-validation, and stratified splitting.
