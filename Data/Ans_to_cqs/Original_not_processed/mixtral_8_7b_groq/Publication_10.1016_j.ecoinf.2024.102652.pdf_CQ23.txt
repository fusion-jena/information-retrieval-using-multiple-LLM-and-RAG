Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some details about the training process that indirectly contribute to the model's generalizability.

Firstly, the training set's data was normalized and standardized before being fed into the network. This step is crucial as it ensures that all input features have a similar scale, preventing any single feature from unduly influencing the learning process.

Secondly, the batch size was set to 32. This choice is a compromise between memory limitations and utilizing computer resources. A smaller batch size can help in avoiding overfitting by introducing more variability in each update, which can improve the model's ability to generalize.

Thirdly, the optimizer used was Adam, which is a popular choice due to its ability to adaptively learn the optimal learning rate. This can help in avoiding local minima and thus improve the model's generalizability.

Fourthly, the learning rate varied with the group based on the cosine function's law. This approach, known as cosine annealing, can help in exploring the loss landscape more thoroughly, which can lead to better generalization.

Lastly, an early stopping function was used with 100 epochs, halting the learning process if there was no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. This method can prevent overfitting by stopping the training when the model starts to memorize the training data rather than learning to generalize.

However, these measures do not explicitly ensure a diverse dataset or stratified splitting. Therefore, without further information, it's unclear if these important aspects of model generalizability were addressed in the study.
