Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning being applied to the data before training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the input images undergo random rotations, flips, and other image augmentation operations during the network training process. Additionally, the images are cropped to a size of 256 Ã— 256 pixels prior to being divided into training, validation, and testing sets. It is possible that other preprocessing steps were taken but were not mentioned in the text. In general, it is common practice to perform some level of data preprocessing before training a deep learning model, which can include steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning, among others, to ensure that the data is in a suitable format for the model to learn effectively.
