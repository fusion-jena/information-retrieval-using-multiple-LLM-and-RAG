The provided context discusses bias correction methods in the context of environmental covariates and species distribution models (SDMs), rather than the preprocessing of deep learning pipelines. However, I will attempt to answer the query using the relevant information provided.

In the context of environmental covariates and SDMs, the following techniques are discussed for addressing data bias:

1. Aggregation background method: This method outperforms other methods in addressing OS bias when the presence sample size (n) is less than or equal to 70 and ranks second only to geographic filtering when n > 70. For RD bias, it outperforms other methods when n â‰¤ 50 and ranks second only to geographic filtering or the similarity background method when n > 70.

2. Geographic filtering: This method is used as a baseline for comparison with other bias correction methods. It is particularly effective for OS bias when the presence sample size is larger than 70 and for RD bias when the presence sample size is greater than 50.

3. Similarity background method: This method is used for addressing RD bias and ranks second only to the aggregation background method when n > 70.

4. Thickening background: This method is not recommended due to its tendency to lose ecological information and simplify environmental variability in species distributions.

5. Weaken bias covariates: This method is not discussed in detail, but it is mentioned that it requires sampling effort information outside the target species, which is often unavailable.

6. Restricted background: This method is not recommended due to the difficulty in determining a restricted distance and its invalidity for bias not caused by point spatial autocorrelation.

7. Invalid for bias not caused by point spatial autocorrelation: This is not a technique but a limitation mentioned for some methods.

8. Need to determine parameters that constrain environmental proximity: This is another limitation mentioned for some methods.

9. Not suitable for small sample sizes: This is a limitation mentioned for some methods.

10. Subjective, correcting bias from geospatial only: This is a limitation mentioned for some methods.

11. Subjective, correcting bias from the environment only: This is another limitation mentioned for some methods.

Based on the provided context, the techniques used for addressing data bias in the context of environmental covariates and SDMs include aggregation background method, geographic filtering, similarity background method, thickening background, weaken bias covariates, restricted background, and subjective bias correction methods. However, these techniques may not directly apply to the preprocessing of deep learning pipelines.
