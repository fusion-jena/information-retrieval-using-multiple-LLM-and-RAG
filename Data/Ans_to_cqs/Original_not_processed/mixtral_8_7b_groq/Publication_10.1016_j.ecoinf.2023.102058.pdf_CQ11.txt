Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no specific data repository link mentioned for the deep learning pipeline used for predicting water quality parameters from hyperspectral data. However, there are a few studies mentioned that have used machine learning and deep learning techniques for water quality estimation using remote sensing data.

For instance, Saberioon et al. (2023) discussed the importance of essential parameters such as the number and spatial distribution of samples and the influence of different atmospheric correction algorithms for creating a representative dataset and developing an ML-based model with acceptable generalization for hyperspectral data. Similarly, Maier et al. (2021) used deep learning with WASI simulation data for estimating chlorophyll a concentration of inland water bodies. Novo et al. (1991) conducted a laboratory experiment relating spectral reflectance to total suspended solids, and Olmanson et al. (2013) used airborne hyperspectral remote sensing to assess the spatial distribution of water quality characteristics in large rivers.

While these studies have used various datasets for their analyses, they have not explicitly shared the datasets used in their research on data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline related to water quality prediction from hyperspectral data.

An alternative approach would be to contact the authors of the aforementioned studies to request access to their datasets or data repositories. Additionally, researchers can explore publicly available hyperspectral data repositories such as the NASA Hyperspectral Data Archive (Hyperion) or the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) Data Portal for water quality-related research.
