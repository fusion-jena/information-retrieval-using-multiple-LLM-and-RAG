Answer:
The provided context discusses the use of AutoML, specifically the AutoGluon library, in a study that involves automating machine learning tasks such as data pre-processing, algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning. However, the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers, is not mentioned or detailed in the context.

AutoGluon is an open-source library that simplifies the process of training high-performance machine learning models on structured data with minimal code. It emphasizes advanced data processing, deep learning, and ensemble techniques, automating feature engineering, data pre-processing, model training, and ensembling using methods like multi-layer stacking and neural network embeddings.

While the context provides information on AutoGluon's overall approach and training strategy, it does not specify the type of deep learning model utilized in the study. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to accurately determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
