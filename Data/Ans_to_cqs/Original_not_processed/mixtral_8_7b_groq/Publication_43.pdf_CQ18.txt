Answer:

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the ResNet-classifier was trained using a CNN-based model and the training took 8 minutes and 22 seconds. The training process involves updating the network weights based on the learning rate and the difference in the cost function (Equation wt+1 = µwt − α∆J(wt)). The performance of the model during training can be monitored by evaluating the cost function or loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted and actual values. The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration, and a suitable learning rate is chosen to ensure the model converges to the optimal solution without overshooting. The training process can also be monitored by tracking the accuracy of the model on a validation set, which is a separate dataset not used in training. The validation set is used to provide an unbiased estimate of the model's ability to generalize to new data. However, the context does not provide information on whether a validation set was used or how the model's performance was monitored during training.
