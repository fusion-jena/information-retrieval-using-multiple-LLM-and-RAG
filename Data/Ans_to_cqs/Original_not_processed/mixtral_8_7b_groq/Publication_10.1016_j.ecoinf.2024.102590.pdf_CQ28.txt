The provided context does not explicitly mention which platform was used to deploy a deep learning model. However, it does mention that Google Earth Engine (GEE) played a significant role in the analysis of historical aerial images. GEE is a cloud-based platform developed by Google that offers geospatial analysis capabilities, including image processing and machine learning. While it's not explicitly stated, it is possible that GEE was used to deploy the deep learning model mentioned in the study. Nonetheless, based on the given context, it is not possible to definitively answer this question.
