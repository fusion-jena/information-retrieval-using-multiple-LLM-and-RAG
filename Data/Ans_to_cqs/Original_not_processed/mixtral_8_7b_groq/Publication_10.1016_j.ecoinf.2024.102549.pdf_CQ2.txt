Answer:::

Deep learning pipelines can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific task and the deep learning model used.

In the context provided, CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are mentioned as a deep learning model that excels in processing high-dimensional imagery. CNNs are commonly used for image-related tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Therefore, image data formats like JPEG, PNG, or TIFF are frequently used in CNN-based deep learning pipelines.

For instance, in the study mentioned, the authors use a CNN model to analyze water quality monitoring data. Here, the input data is likely in the form of image files, where each image represents a water quality monitoring band reflectance. The CNN model then processes these images to extract features, detect patterns, and classify water quality levels.

However, deep learning models are not limited to image data. They can also handle other data formats such as audio, video, and CSV files. For example, deep learning models like LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) are commonly used for time series data, such as audio or sensor data, which can be stored in CSV files.

In summary, deep learning pipelines can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific task and the deep learning model used. In the context provided, image data formats are used for a CNN-based deep learning pipeline.
