The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions that the researchers used YOLOv6 for their model and experimented with different sets of hyper-parameters and spatial resolutions of the imagery. However, it does not specify the hardware used for training the model. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
