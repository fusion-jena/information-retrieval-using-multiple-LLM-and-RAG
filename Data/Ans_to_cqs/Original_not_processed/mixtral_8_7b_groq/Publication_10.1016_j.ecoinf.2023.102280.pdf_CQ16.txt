Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it is mentioned that evaluation metrics such as PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), SnNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio), and SR (Structural Similarity) are used for the assessment of the performance of audio enhancement models.

In the context of the ablation studies, it is mentioned that fine-tuning does not necessarily require large datasets and similar performance could be achieved using a subset of 100 training examples. This suggests that the training process might be evaluated based on the performance achieved on a validation set, rather than the amount of training data processed.

In the appendix, results are presented for the AviaNZ native New Zealand bird dataset, where four different methods are compared: the original recordings, WPD (Wavelet Packet Decomposition), spectral subtraction, and CMGAN (Conditional Multi-band Generative Adversarial Network) trained on a predator dataset. For each method, the SnNR, SR, and PSNR are reported. It can be inferred that these metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the different methods, and therefore, they might also be used to determine when the training of a model is complete.

In general, it is common practice in machine learning to use a validation set to monitor the performance of a model during training. The validation set is a separate dataset that is used to evaluate the model's performance after each epoch (iteration of the entire training dataset). Training is typically considered complete when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model is no longer improving its performance on unseen data. This practice is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, but it can be inferred based on the general practices in machine learning and the use of evaluation metrics.

In summary, while the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not provided in the context, it can be inferred that evaluation metrics such as PSNR, SnNR, and SR are used to assess the performance of audio enhancement models. Additionally, based on general practices in machine learning, it can be inferred that a validation set is used to monitor the model's performance during training, and training is typically considered complete when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase.
