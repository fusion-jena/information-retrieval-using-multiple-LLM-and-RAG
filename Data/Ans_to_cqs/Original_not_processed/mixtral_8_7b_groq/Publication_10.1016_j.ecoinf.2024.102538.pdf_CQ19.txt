Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific information about the deep learning frameworks (such as TensorFlow or PyTorch) used to build the models. However, it does provide details about the architecture and components of some of the models.

For instance, Zhang et al. (2019) incorporated a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network into a 3DCNN model, but it doesn't specify the deep learning framework used. Similarly, Sevilla and Glotin (2017) introduced time and time-frequency attention mechanisms to Inception V4 for the BirdCLEF 2017 Competition, but the framework is not mentioned. Fu et al. (2023) proposed an improved ACGAN model named DR-ACGAN based on the residual structure, but the deep learning framework is not provided in the context.

In the Wang et al. paper, the context focuses on the architecture of their baseline model and the modifications made to it. The model consists of an entry flow, a middle flow, and an exit flow, with a separable convolutional (DSC) block in the exit flow. They also introduce a position attention module and a hierarchical block for semantic feature learning. However, the deep learning framework is not mentioned.

In summary, while the context provides valuable information about the architecture, components, and approaches used in these deep learning models, it does not specify the deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) used to build them.
