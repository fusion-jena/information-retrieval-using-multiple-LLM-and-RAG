Answer:::

The provided context focuses on the description of various deep learning models and techniques, but it does not directly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the EfficientNetV2 network uses an improved progressive learning approach, which can dynamically adjust the regularization method based on the training image size.

In general, optimization techniques are crucial in deep learning pipelines to minimize the loss function and update the model parameters during training. Some of the commonly used optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Momentum, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG), Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter. However, SGD can suffer from slow convergence and oscillations during training.

To address these issues, various modifications have been proposed, such as Momentum and Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG). Momentum uses a moving average of the past gradients to smooth the updates and accelerate convergence. NAG is a variant of Momentum that uses the future gradient instead of the past gradient to update the parameters.

Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam are adaptive learning rate algorithms that adjust the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradient information. Adagrad uses a per-parameter learning rate that decays over time, while Adadelta and RMSprop use a running average of the squared gradients to adjust the learning rate. Adam combines the ideas of Momentum and RMSprop to achieve faster convergence and better performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, optimization algorithms such as SGD, Momentum, NAG, Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam are commonly used to minimize the loss function and update the model parameters during training.
