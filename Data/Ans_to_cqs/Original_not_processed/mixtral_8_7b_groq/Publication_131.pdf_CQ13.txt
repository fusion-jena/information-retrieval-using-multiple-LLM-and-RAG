The provided context discusses the structure of a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for sound classification, including details about the number of filters, kernel size, and the number of neurons in the fully connected layer. However, it does not explicitly mention the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model.

The learning rate is a hyperparameter that determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. The optimizer is a method that updates the parameters of the model based on the gradient of the loss function.

Without this information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer. However, it is common to use popular optimizers such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSprop. The learning rate can be set to a fixed value or can be adapted during training using techniques such as learning rate decay or learning rate schedules.

Therefore, while the context provides valuable information about the architecture of the CNN, it does not include details about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model.
