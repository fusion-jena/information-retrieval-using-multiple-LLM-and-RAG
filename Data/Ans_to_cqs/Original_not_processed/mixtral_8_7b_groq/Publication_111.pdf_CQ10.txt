Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The details of the deep learning model implementation are mentioned, such as the use of the Python programming language version 3.8.5 and the implementation of the GRU-DNN model. However, there is no mention of a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
