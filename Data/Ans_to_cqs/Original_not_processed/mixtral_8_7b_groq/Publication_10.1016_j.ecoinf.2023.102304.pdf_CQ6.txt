Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, the context does mention that Runge et al. (2022) optimized the LTR (Land Trendr) model's parameters for better accuracy in capturing the index response to wildfire. This implies that some preprocessing steps were likely taken before training the model.

In general, preprocessing data before training a deep learning model is an essential step to improve the model's performance and ensure that the input data is suitable for the model. Some common preprocessing steps include:

1. Data cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant, missing, or duplicate data from the dataset.
2. Data normalization: This step is necessary to ensure that all features have the same scale. Normalization techniques include min-max scaling, z-score scaling, and decimal scaling.
3. Data transformation: This step involves converting categorical variables into numerical variables or encoding them using techniques such as one-hot encoding.
4. Data augmentation: This technique is used to increase the size of the dataset by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, or flipping to the existing data.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training the LTR model, it is reasonable to assume that some or all of these preprocessing steps were taken to optimize the model's performance.
