The provided context discusses the use of deep learning and machine learning algorithms for enhancing groundwater-climate interactions understanding, particularly within the sub-basins of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) region. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

Nevertheless, some techniques that are commonly used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the data into homogeneous subgroups or strata based on certain criteria, such as class labels. This ensures that each subset is representative of the whole dataset, reducing bias and improving model performance.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances in the minority class to balance the dataset. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances in the majority class to balance the dataset. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help prevent bias and improve model generalization.

These techniques can be useful in addressing data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, the specific technique used will depend on the dataset and the problem at hand. It is essential to carefully evaluate the dataset and consider the potential sources of bias before selecting a technique.
