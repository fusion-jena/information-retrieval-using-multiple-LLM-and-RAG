The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of a machine learning-powered BirdNET app and the development of machine learning algorithms for identifying bird species using sound recordings from Xeno-canto, a public bird sound repository.

The development of machine learning algorithms for identifying bird species from sound recordings would likely require significant computational resources, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) or tensor processing units (TPUs), to handle the large number of labeled recordings used for training the models. GPUs and TPUs are specialized hardware designed for accelerating machine learning tasks, and they are commonly used for training deep learning models.

Therefore, while the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model are not mentioned in the provided context, it is reasonable to assume that GPUs or TPUs were used given the mention of machine learning algorithms and the large number of labeled recordings used for training.
