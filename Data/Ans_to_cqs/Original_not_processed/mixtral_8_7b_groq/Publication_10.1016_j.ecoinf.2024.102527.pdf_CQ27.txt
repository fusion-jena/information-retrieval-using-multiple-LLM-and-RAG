The text provided does not give a detailed description of the process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does provide some context about the training process and the computing platform used.

During the training phase, the researchers used the PyTorch 1.7.1 platform to train the model on the training sets. They stopped the training process when the loss value on the validation set no longer decreased. After training, they tested the model performance on the test set.

The computing platform used for training was a Dell PowerEdge C4130 rack server with two Tesla K80 GPUs and 256 GB of memory. However, the text does not provide information on how the trained model was prepared for deployment, such as model serialization or platform selection.

In summary, while the text provides details about the training process and the computing platform used, it does not give a clear description of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the information given.
