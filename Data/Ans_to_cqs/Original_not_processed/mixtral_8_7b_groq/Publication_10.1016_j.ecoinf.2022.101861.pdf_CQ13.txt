Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the specific deep learning model, its architecture, or the hyperparameters used such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses a study related to identifying bird species, specifically nightjars in the Brazilian Pantanal, using a combined index based on the number of scientific articles, observations on a citizen science platform, and recordings on a public online database of sounds. However, it does not mention any deep learning model or its hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query with the information given.
