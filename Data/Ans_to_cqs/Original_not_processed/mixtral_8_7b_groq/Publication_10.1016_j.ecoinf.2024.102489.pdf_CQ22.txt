The provided context does not specifically mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does provide details about the evaluation of a random forest model for estimating gross primary productivity (GPP) in ChinaFlux sites. The metrics used for the random forest model include out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation.

In the context of machine learning and deep learning, some common metrics used to evaluate the performance of a model include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), among others. These metrics can provide insights into various aspects of the model's performance, such as its ability to correctly classify instances, its precision in predicting positive instances, its recall in identifying all positive instances, and the balance between precision and recall.

In the case of the random forest model for GPP estimation, the OOB error is used as a metric for model evaluation. The OOB error is an estimate of the generalization error of the model, calculated based on the instances that are not used in the construction of a particular tree. This error is then averaged over all trees in the forest to obtain the overall OOB error. Additionally, five-fold cross-validation is used to further assess the model's performance and to optimize the model's hyperparameters.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query regarding the metrics used for a deep learning model, it does mention the use of OOB error and cross-validation for a random forest model. In general, for deep learning models, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC are commonly used for model evaluation.
