Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used to increase the amount of training data and improve the robustness of deep learning models. These techniques generate new training examples by applying transformations to the existing data. For instance, in image classification, flipping involves horizontally or vertically flipping the images, rotating involves rotating the images by a certain angle, and scaling involves changing the size of the images. However, the context focuses on the use of ResNet-50, a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network, for feature extraction and classification of spectrogram images. It does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied to the spectrogram images before feeding them into the ResNet-50 model. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer this query.
