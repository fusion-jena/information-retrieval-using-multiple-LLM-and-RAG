Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on various studies and methods used for plant species recognition using deep learning techniques, but it does not mention where the code for these pipelines is available. It is possible that the code for these studies is not publicly available or was not shared in the sources cited. If you are interested in a specific study or method, I would recommend contacting the authors directly to inquire about the availability of the code.
