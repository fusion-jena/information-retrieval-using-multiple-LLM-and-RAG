Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on describing the network architecture and method used for ecoacoustic analysis, but it does not mention any data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide information on data augmentation techniques applied in this specific case. It is possible that no data augmentation was used, or it may have been employed but not included in the context provided. In general, data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling can be useful for improving model performance and preventing overfitting, especially when training data is limited.
