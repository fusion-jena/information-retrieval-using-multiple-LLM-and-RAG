The provided context does not give information about specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context focuses on data packages in the ESS-DIVE repository, which contains data funded under the ESS program, including projects like AmeriFlux, WFSFA, and NGEE-Tropics. These projects involve multi-disciplinary data packages, with a focus on data integration, compatible usage policies, and appropriate credit for data producers.

The challenges mentioned in the context, like ensuring datasets receive appropriate credit and deciding authorship, are not directly related to the query about deep learning datasets. However, the context does mention the importance of data usage rights/licenses, which is relevant to the use of datasets in any context, including deep learning.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query about deep learning datasets, it does emphasize the importance of data usage policies and appropriate credit for data producers, which are considerations when using any dataset.
