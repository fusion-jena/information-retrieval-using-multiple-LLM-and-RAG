Answer:::

The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context provided is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the training process involves k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is divided into five subsets, and the YOLOv7 detection model undergoes five rounds of training and validation. 

The accuracy curve graph resulting from the 5-fold cross-validation model suggests that the training process is evaluated based on the model's performance in optimally using all the samples in the dataset and ensuring that each sample is trained and validated in a different subset. 

Moreover, the text mentions the use of a threshold in the appearance feature descriptor of the detected box and the restriction condition. This threshold is used to determine when two boxes match excellently. However, there is no direct mention of using a validation loss plateau or any other specific criterion to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, while the text provides some insights into the training process, it does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
