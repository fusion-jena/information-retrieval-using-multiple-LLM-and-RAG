Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in this study uses Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGD with momentum) as the optimization technique for training the AlexNet (AN) convolutional neural network. The learning rate for this optimizer was set to 0.001.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular optimization algorithm for training deep learning models. It updates the model parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function concerning the current parameters. The "stochastic" part of SGD refers to the fact that it uses a single training example at a time to compute the gradient, rather than the entire training set, which makes it computationally efficient. The "momentum" term in SGD with momentum helps accelerate learning in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations by incorporating a moving average of past gradients.

It is worth noting that other optimization techniques like Adam or RMSprop were not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, the choice of optimization algorithm can significantly impact the training process and the final model performance. Therefore, it is essential to consider other optimization techniques and compare their performance when designing deep learning pipelines.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in this study uses Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGD with momentum) as the optimization technique for training the AlexNet convolutional neural network. However, it is important to consider other optimization techniques like Adam or RMSprop when designing deep learning pipelines.
