Answer:

The context provided does not give specific information about the criteria used to split the data for training the deep learning models. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to train the model, i.e., to learn the parameters of the model. The validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model, such as the learning rate, batch size, number of layers, etc. The testing set is used to evaluate the performance of the final model.

The splitting of the data can be done randomly or sequentially. In random splitting, the data is shuffled and then divided into the three sets. In sequential splitting, the data is divided based on some predefined criteria, such as time, location, or class.

For instance, in the context, it is mentioned that the validation of the PTDLEN-VAE model takes place on a benchmark dataset. However, the specifics of how the data is split for training, validation, and testing are not provided.

Therefore, while the context provides information on the deep learning models used for satellite image classification, it does not give specific details on the data splitting criteria.
