Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. There are several studies and papers mentioned, but none of them provide a link to a code repository for a deep learning pipeline. Some of them mention the use of specific deep learning models, like the Generalized Focal Loss and a modified YOLOv8 detection network, but there is no indication of where the code for these models can be found. Therefore, I am unable to provide a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
