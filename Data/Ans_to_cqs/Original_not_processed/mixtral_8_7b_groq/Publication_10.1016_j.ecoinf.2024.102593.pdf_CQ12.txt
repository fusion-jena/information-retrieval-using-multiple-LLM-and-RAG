Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context that mentions the use of a ResNet152-architecture, which is based on the ResNet152 model developed for image classification by He et al. (2015). The ResNet152 model is a type of CNN that is known for its deep residual learning capability. Furthermore, the context mentions the use of mel spectrograms as input to the model, which is a common preprocessing step for audio data in CNN-based models. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN.
