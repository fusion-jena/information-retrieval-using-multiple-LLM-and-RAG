Answer:::
The provided context discusses the evaluation of a deep learning model's performance using several metrics, although it does not explicitly list all the metrics used. 

The first mentioned metric is the Overall Accuracy (OA), which is a percentage indicating the ratio of correctly classified pixels to the total number of pixels. This metric is used in Table 5, where the reduction rates of the OA in the UAV image models are presented.

Another metric is the kappa coefficient, which measures the agreement between the predicted and actual classifications, taking into account the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance. Like the OA, the kappa coefficient is also used in Table 5 for the UAV image models.

The context also mentions a comparison of the classification results of the MRS_DeepLabV3+ model with the DeepLabV3+ model, implying that the models were compared using some form of accuracy metric. Specifically, the MRS_DeepLabV3+ model showed an accuracy enhancement of about 3% compared to the DeepLabV3+ model.

However, the context does not explicitly mention other metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that the Overall Accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. Other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score are not explicitly mentioned.
