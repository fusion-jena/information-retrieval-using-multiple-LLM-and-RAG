Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the frameworks used to build a deep learning model. The text focuses on the methodology and process of generating redescriptions, which are pairs of queries over climate variables and dental trait variables, respectively. The two runs of the method had different constraints and threshold settings, but there is no mention of deep learning models or the frameworks used to build them. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
