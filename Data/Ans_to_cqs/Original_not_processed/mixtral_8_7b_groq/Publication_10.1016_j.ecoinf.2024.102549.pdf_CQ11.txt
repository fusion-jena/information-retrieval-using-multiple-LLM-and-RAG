Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically the AlexNet architecture, in analyzing water quality and predicting cyanobacterial harmful algae blooms. However, it does not give any details about the data or code repository for this research. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a data repository as requested in the query.
