Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses various studies related to bioacoustic monitoring, wavelet transformation Hidden Markov Model (WT-HMM), and dataset size selection for model training. However, it does not mention any of the standard datasets commonly used in deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

In the study by Ibrahim et al., 2018, the authors used North Atlantic Right Whale up-calls for their analysis. Meanwhile, Kahl et al., 2021, employed bird audio recordings for their research. These specific datasets are not generalizable deep learning datasets and are used for domain-specific applications.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information about the standard deep learning datasets (MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet) used in a deep learning pipeline. The mentioned studies work with domain-specific datasets for bioacoustic monitoring.
