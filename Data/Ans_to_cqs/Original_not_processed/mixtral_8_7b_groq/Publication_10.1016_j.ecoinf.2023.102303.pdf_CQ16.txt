The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the deep learning methodologies applied to underwater fish video processing. However, it does mention that the models are developed with a focus on turnaround time and accuracy.

In the context, turnaround time is defined as the time from dataset collection to model deployment. The two proposed semi- and weakly-supervised methods are compared to a state-of-the-art fully-supervised method for clear water, and both are significantly faster, while providing slightly reduced accuracies. This suggests a trade-off between development time and budget, and the accuracy required.

Additionally, the context mentions that the development of deep learning methodologies continues to advance at an astonishing rate, with applications ranging from biomedical to environmental sciences. This implies that there may be various criteria used to determine when training is complete, depending on the specific application and requirements.

In general, one common criterion used to determine when training is complete in deep learning models is when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly. This indicates that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data and is no longer improving its performance on the validation data. Other criteria may include early stopping based on a patience parameter, monitoring the performance on a separate test dataset, or using learning rate schedules to gradually decrease the learning rate as training progresses.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the deep learning methodologies applied to underwater fish video processing, it is likely that a combination of criteria such as validation loss plateauing, early stopping, and learning rate schedules are used to ensure optimal performance and turnaround time.
