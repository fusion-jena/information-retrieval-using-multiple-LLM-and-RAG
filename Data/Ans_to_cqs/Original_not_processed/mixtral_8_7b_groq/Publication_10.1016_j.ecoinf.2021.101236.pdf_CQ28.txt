Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the design of the model, which follows current best practices in deep learning and is based on the Wide ResNet design with modifications from Xie et al., Schlüter, Ioffe, and Szegedy. The model takes as input a single-channel mel spectrogram of size 64 × 384 and outputs probability predictions for all 987 classes per second. The training process of this model is presented in the BirdNET algorithm, but there is no mention of the platform used for deployment.
