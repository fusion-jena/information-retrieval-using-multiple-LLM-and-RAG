Answer:::

The methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include surveys, sensors, and public datasets.

Surveys are a common method used to collect data, particularly in the field of ecological informatics. For instance, the World Agroforestry Centre has databases that contain information collected through surveys (World Agroforestry Centre, 2011). Surveys can be conducted through various means, such as interviews, questionnaires, or observations. They can provide valuable information on various aspects of the environment, including land use, vegetation, and soil characteristics.

Sensors are another method used to collect data, particularly for remote sensing applications. Sensors can be used to measure various environmental variables, such as temperature, humidity, and light intensity. In the context of deep learning, sensors can be used to collect data on biophysical variables, such as above-ground biomass, water quality, and mangrove extent. For example, Yang et al. (2018) used artificial neural networks and remote sensing data to model grassland above-ground biomass, while Byrd et al. (2014) evaluated sensor types and environmental controls for mapping biomass of coastal marsh emergent vegetation. Sensors can be mounted on various platforms, such as satellites, aircraft, or ground-based stations, depending on the spatial and temporal scales of the data required.

Public datasets are a third method used to collect data for deep learning applications. Public datasets can be obtained from various sources, such as government agencies, research institutions, or international organizations. They can provide a wealth of information on various aspects of the environment, including climate, land use, and biodiversity. For instance, the Global Mangrove Watch provides a 2010 global baseline of mangrove extent, which can be used for various applications, such as monitoring mangrove dynamics and assessing their ecosystem services (Bunting et al., 2018). Public datasets can be particularly useful for deep learning applications, as they can provide large and diverse datasets for training and testing machine learning algorithms.

In summary, surveys, sensors, and public datasets are methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Surveys can provide information on various aspects of the environment, particularly through interviews, questionnaires, or observations. Sensors can be used to measure various environmental variables, particularly for remote sensing applications. Public datasets can provide a wealth of information on various aspects of the environment, particularly from government agencies, research institutions, or international organizations. These methods can be used in isolation or in combination, depending on the specific requirements of the deep learning application.
