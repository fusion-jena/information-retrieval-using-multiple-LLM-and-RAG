Answer:::
The specific type of deep learning model used in the study mentioned is a multilayer perceptron (MLP), which is a type of feedforward artificial neural network. This model comprises an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer receives environmental covariates that are used for prediction, and the output layer yields the prediction results (SOCS). Each node in the hidden layers connects adjacent layers via the activation function. The study attributes the successful prediction of soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) to the robust deep learning models, specifically the MLP. Other deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
