Based on the provided context, the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. The text describes the use of the RMSprop optimizer, an initial learning rate of 0.0001, and training the network for 300 epochs with 24 images per batch. However, there is no information about dropout, L2 regularization, or any other regularization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query without additional context.
