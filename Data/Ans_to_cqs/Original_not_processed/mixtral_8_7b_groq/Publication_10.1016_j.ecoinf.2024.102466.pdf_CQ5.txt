Answer:::

In the study mentioned, a dataset comprising 9717 images of 15 wild bird species was proposed and used. This dataset was acquired by camera traps in Chinaâ€™s Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park. The study employed 8 deep learning algorithms for bird object detection and evaluated their performance based on this dataset. However, the text does not mention or use any of the commonly known datasets in deep learning such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The focus of the study is on the application of deep learning for bird detection using a specific dataset, rather than comparing performance across various datasets.
