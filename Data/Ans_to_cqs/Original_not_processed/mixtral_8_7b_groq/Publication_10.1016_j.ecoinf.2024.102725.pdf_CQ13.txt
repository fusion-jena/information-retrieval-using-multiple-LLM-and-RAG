Answer:::

The provided context does not contain specific information about the deep learning model used in the Wang et al. (2023) study for improved NDVI reconstruction and long-term vegetation cover study in the Danjiang River basin. There is no mention of the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters typically found in deep learning models.

However, the study does mention the use of fusion methods enhanced by deep learning techniques. Still, it does not provide details about the specific deep learning model employed. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer this query accurately.
