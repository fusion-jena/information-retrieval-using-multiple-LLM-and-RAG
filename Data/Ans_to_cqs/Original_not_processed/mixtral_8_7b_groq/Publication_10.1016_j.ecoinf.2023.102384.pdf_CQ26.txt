Answer:::

The provided context discusses data collection, curation, and preprocessing techniques in the context of deep learning for computer vision tasks, particularly for counting and recognizing objects in images. However, it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

In the context of the Yu and Koltun (2016) paper, data bias is addressed by using multi-scale context aggregation through dilated convolutions. This technique helps the model to capture features at different scales and avoid overfitting to specific scales or sizes, which could potentially lead to data bias.

Tan et al. (2017) do not explicitly mention any bias reduction techniques, but they do use a combination of data collection and preprocessing techniques. They collect data from various sources and curate it by breaking down images into smaller patches. During training, they randomly crop square patches and apply horizontal and vertical flipping as data augmentation. In the validation phase, they divide images into regularly-spaced, overlapping patches and process them individually, reconstructing the overall output by combining the predictions from the patches. These techniques help to increase the variability of the data and reduce overfitting, but they do not directly address data bias.

Zhong et al. (2018) and the Ecological Informatics (2023) paper do not provide information on data preprocessing techniques, including bias reduction methods.

In summary, while the provided context discusses various data collection, curation, and preprocessing techniques, it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
