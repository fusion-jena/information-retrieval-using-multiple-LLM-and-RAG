Answer:::
The metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the given context is accuracy. Accuracy is defined as the percentage of correct classifications out of the total number of classifications made by the model. In this case, the deep ResNet model trained on the large AT0 dataset achieved a mean accuracy of 78.00% on the T2 test-dataset. Additionally, the standard deviation of 15.16% provides a measure of the variability of the model's performance across different species. The accuracy varied among species, with the lowest accuracy of 54.14% for Naso brevirostris and the highest accuracy of 99.07% for Abudefduf vagiensis.

Other metrics such as precision and recall are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions (correctly labeled positive instances) to the total predicted positive instances. Recall, on the other hand, is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positive instances. These metrics are often used in conjunction with accuracy to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, especially in cases where the class distribution is imbalanced. However, based on the given context, it appears that accuracy was the primary metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
