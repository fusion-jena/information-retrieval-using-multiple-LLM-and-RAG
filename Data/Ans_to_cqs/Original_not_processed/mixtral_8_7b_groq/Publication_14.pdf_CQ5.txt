Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the pipeline involves processing camera trap images and organizing them into different classes.

In the study by Price Tack et al. (2016), they developed a system for animal detection in time-lapse camera trap images using a deep learning pipeline. They collected images for each class and trained a fine-tuned neural network with a batch size of 100 for 20,000 steps. However, the specific names or details of the datasets used are not provided.

Similarly, Nogueira et al. (2017) worked on improving the use of convolutional neural networks for remote sensing scene classification. They used a dataset of high-resolution satellite images, but the specific name or details of the dataset are not provided.

Therefore, while the context provides information on the use of deep learning pipelines for processing camera trap images and remote sensing data, the specific datasets used are not explicitly mentioned.
