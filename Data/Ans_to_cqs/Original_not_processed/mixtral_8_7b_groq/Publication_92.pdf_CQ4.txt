The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does describe a deep learning pipeline for fish species identification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a custom architecture based on GoogLeNet.

The pipeline involves preprocessing the data by extracting cropped thumbnails and their corresponding labels from sliding windows in video frames. Then, these thumbnails are sent to the CNN for classification. The network consists of convolutional layers that use convolutional kernels, activation functions, and pooling phases to extract features from the input images.

After the classification, a post-processing step is applied, where a motion score is computed for each sliding window based on the average absolute difference with the window at the same position in the previous frame. This score is used for the final detection decision, assuming that most fish are moving.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention data augmentation techniques, it is possible that the authors applied some of these techniques during the data preprocessing phase to increase the variability and robustness of the training data. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
