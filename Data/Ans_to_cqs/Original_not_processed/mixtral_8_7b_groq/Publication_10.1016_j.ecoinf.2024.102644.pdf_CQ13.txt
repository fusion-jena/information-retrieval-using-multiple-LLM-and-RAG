Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the use of deep learning models for species richness estimation. The models mentioned in the context are ENMs (Ecological Niche Models), and the specific deep learning model is not specified. However, the context does mention the use of MaxEnt for species distribution modeling. MaxEnt is a machine learning method, not a deep learning method, and it has its own set of parameters that can be tuned for better performance.

In the context, the authors mention using AUC (Area Under the Curve) to select the optimal hinge features and ensure that the models used for species richness estimation reached a least a 0.75 AUC. AUC is a metric used to evaluate the performance of binary classifiers, and it measures the area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve. The ROC curve plots the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. AUC ranges from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates perfect classification, and a value of 0.5 indicates random classification.

Therefore, based on the provided context, there is no information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for species richness estimation. However, the authors do mention using MaxEnt for species distribution modeling and evaluating the model performance using AUC.
