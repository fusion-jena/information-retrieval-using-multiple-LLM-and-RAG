Answer:::
The provided context discusses the overall process and design of a deep learning model used for bird species classification, but it does not give specific details about the hyperparameters used in the model such as the learning rate or optimizer.

The model follows current best practices in deep learning as outlined in (Chollet, 2017) and is built upon the original Wide ResNet design. The downsampling blocks employ changes suggested in (Xie et al., 2018) and the classification block is derived from (Schlüter, 2018). The model takes as input a single channel mel spectrogram of size 64 × 384, visualizing three seconds of audio at a sampling rate of 48 kHz.

The training algorithm used in this model is called BirdNET, which builds on previous successes using CNNs and spectrogram data to classify bird species. The text mentions that they provide insights into their training and testing workflow of a deep artificial neural network, but it does not specify the hyperparameters used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I am unable to answer the query about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
