Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training of the ResNet50 model is complete. Common criteria used in deep learning model training include validation loss plateau, reaching a certain number of epochs, or when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving. It is possible that the authors of the paper used one or more of these methods, but without additional information, a specific answer cannot be given.
