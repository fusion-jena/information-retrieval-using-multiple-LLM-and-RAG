Answer:

The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of camera trap images in a study related to animal detection using deep learning (Swanson et al., 2015; Norouzzadeh et al., 2018). Camera traps are sensors that capture images or videos of wildlife in their natural habitats.

Additionally, the context discusses the use of a large-scale dataset (NACTI dataset) for training a deep learning model (Norouzzadeh et al., 2018). Public datasets like ImageNet, COCO, and others are commonly used in deep learning for training and testing models.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it implies the use of sensors such as camera traps and public datasets for training deep learning models.
