Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention or specify any data repository where the data used in the deep learning pipeline is available. The context includes information about the use of ResNet-50, a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) that has been trained on over 1 million images from the ImageNet database, but it does not provide information about the specific dataset used in the study related to polar bear detection.

The study performed all deep learning-related operations in MATLAB 2020b and used a GeForce RTX 2070 Super GPU with 8 GB of memory for CNN training and image classification. However, the context does not provide any information about the dataset's availability or location.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it is not covered in the given context.
