Answer:::

The data repository for the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. There is no mention of any data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF where the data might be available. However, it is mentioned that a DeepMeerkat executable for Mac and Windows is available, and reproducible scripts for local and Google cloud environments are provided to allow users to train new models. Additionally, a pre-trained hummingbird model for Mac and Windows is available for download. It is possible that the data used in this study is available through these channels, but without further information it is not possible to determine the exact location of the data repository.
