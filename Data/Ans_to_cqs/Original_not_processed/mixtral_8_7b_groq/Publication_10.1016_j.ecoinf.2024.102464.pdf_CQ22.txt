The provided context does not specifically mention the use of deep learning models in the study. However, it does discuss the evaluation of various machine learning models used for species distribution modeling.

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of these machine learning models include the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC curve is a graphical representation of the model's performance, plotting the true positive rate (sensitivity) against the false positive rate (1-specificity). The AUC value is a critical measure of model performance, indicating the proportion of correctly classified samples out of all relevant samples.

In the study, the AUC values were extracted for each of the seven machine learning models before and after urban development. The Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and Random Forest (RF) models had the highest AUC value of 0.85, while the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model had the lowest at 0.79. On average, the models demonstrated robust performance with an average AUC value of 0.84.

Therefore, while the context does not directly address the evaluation metrics for deep learning models, it does provide information on the metrics used for other machine learning models, specifically the AUC value of the ROC curve.
