Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of recursive validation of the BA (burned area) classification algorithm over independent wildfires. This approach is used to determine the optimal number of trees in the Random Forest (RF) model, which was set to 500 to improve computational efficiency without losing precision in the BA estimates.

The RF hyperparameters in the GEE (Google Earth Engine) implementation were preserved, except for the number of trees. The mean decrease in the Gini Index (dGI) was calculated to assess RF variable importance on classification accuracy.

The CEMS (Copernicus Emergency Management Service) wildfire events were used for training and validating the BA product in FIREMAP. The training samples were acquired from wildfire events with CEMS activation codes EMSR305, EMSR362, EMSR365, EMSR458, EMSR590, EMSR599, and EMSR625. The validation samples were acquired from wildfire events with CEMS activation codes EMSR227, EMSR538, EMSR580, and EMSR656.

The training samples were used to train the RF model, and the validation samples were used to assess the model's performance. The model's performance was monitored during training by recursively validating the BA classification algorithm over independent wildfires. This approach allowed for the determination of the optimal number of trees in the RF model and the assessment of RF variable importance on classification accuracy.

In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of recursive validation of the BA classification algorithm over independent wildfires, the determination of the optimal number of trees in the RF model, and the assessment of RF variable importance on classification accuracy. The CEMS wildfire events were used for training and validating the BA product in FIREMAP, and the training and validation samples were acquired from different wildfire events with different CEMS activation codes.
