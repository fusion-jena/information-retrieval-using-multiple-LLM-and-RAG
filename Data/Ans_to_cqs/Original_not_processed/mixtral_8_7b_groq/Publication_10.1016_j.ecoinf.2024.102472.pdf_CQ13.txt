Answer:::
The provided context discusses the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) model for estimating carbon stocks, but it does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model. However, I will provide information on the hyperparameters discussed in the context related to the ANN model.

In the ANN model, there are several hyperparameters used during the training phase. These include:

1. Initial arbitrary connection weights: During the training phase, initial arbitrary connection weights are assigned between the input, hidden, and output layers.
2. Learning rate: The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum error. In the context, the optimal learning rate was determined to be 0.01.
3. Momentum: Momentum is used to accelerate learning in the relevant direction and reduce oscillations. The optimal momentum value in this case was 0.18.
4. Training iterations: The number of iterations or epochs required to train the network is another hyperparameter. In this case, the optimal number of training iterations was 500.

These hyperparameters were tuned using a grid search method to optimize the ANN model's performance.

In summary, the hyperparameters mentioned in the context for the ANN model are initial arbitrary connection weights, learning rate, momentum, and training iterations. However, the context does not provide information on deep learning model-specific hyperparameters such as optimizers.
