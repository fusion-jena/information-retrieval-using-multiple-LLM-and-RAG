Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that a ResNet-50 model was used for extracting image background features for classification. ResNet-50 is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that uses residual connections to ease the training of deeper networks.

In the context, it is mentioned that ResNet-50 has reduced complexity and is easy to train despite having deeper layers than other CNN models. This is because of the presence of skip connections between the input and output of each block. However, the specific optimization techniques used during the training of the ResNet-50 model are not mentioned.

Optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, and Adam are commonly used for training deep learning models. These optimization techniques help to minimize the loss function and improve the accuracy of the model.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that one or more of these techniques were used during the training of the ResNet-50 model.
