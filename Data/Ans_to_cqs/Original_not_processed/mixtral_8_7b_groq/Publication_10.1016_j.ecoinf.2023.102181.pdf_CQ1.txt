Answer:::

The context provided does not directly answer the query regarding the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of environmental variables and spatial data in machine learning models for predicting soil classes and marine benthic habitats.

In the context of soil classification, Brus (2023) and Brus et al. (2011) discuss spatial sampling methods for collecting soil data. Spatial sampling can involve surveys to collect point observations of soil properties, as well as the use of sensors to measure environmental variables related to soil formation. Public datasets of soil properties and environmental variables may also be used in machine learning models for soil classification.

In the context of marine benthic habitat mapping, Calvert et al. (2015) use multibeam echosounder data for habitat classification. Multibeam echosounders are sensors that measure the depth and backscatter intensity of the seafloor, providing high-resolution spatial data for habitat classification. Public datasets of marine environmental variables and benthic habitat maps may also be used in machine learning models for marine habitat classification.

In addition to surveys, sensors, and public datasets, other methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline may include experiments, observations, and simulations. The choice of data collection method depends on the research question and the availability of data.

In summary, while the context provided does not directly answer the query, it suggests that spatial sampling, surveys, sensors, and public datasets may be used for collecting raw data in machine learning models for soil and marine habitat classification. Other methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline may include experiments, observations, and simulations.
