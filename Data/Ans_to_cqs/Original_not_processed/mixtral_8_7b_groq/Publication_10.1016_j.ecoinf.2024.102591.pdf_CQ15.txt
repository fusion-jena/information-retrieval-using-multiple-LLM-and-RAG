Based on the provided context, the FIREMAP system uses a machine learning (ML) classification algorithm for burn area (BA) detection, but it does not specify the use of a deep learning pipeline or any optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.

The BA algorithm in FIREMAP primarily relies on a supervised ML classification approach using a mono-temporal perspective with atmospherically corrected, harmonized Sentinel-2 (S2) post-fire Level-2 scenes. The algorithm uses a single-date approach or pixel-based temporal mean composites for selecting pre- and post-fire scenes. The system primarily focuses on the use of S2 data and its near-infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and red-edge (RE) bands for BA detection.

The FIREMAP system is built on Google Earth Engine (GEE), which is a cloud-based platform for high-performance computing and processing vast remote sensing datasets. GEE supports various ML algorithms, but the provided context does not mention the use of deep learning techniques or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam in the BA algorithm.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline of the BA algorithm in FIREMAP.
