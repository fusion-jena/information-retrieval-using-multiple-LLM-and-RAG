Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of deep learning models for tasks such as object detection and image classification, but it does not specify which optimization algorithms were used during the training of these models. Common optimization techniques for deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop, but without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer for this query.
