Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, the text does discuss the use of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a type of machine learning model derived from recurrent neural networks (RNN), which addresses the issue of gradient vanishing and explosion in RNN for long-term sequences. The LSTM model has a special memory unit that comprises a forget gate, input gate, output gate, and hidden layer, which allows for precise control of information and effective learning in long time sequences.

Additionally, the context describes the use of Bayesian optimization, a sequential model-based optimization method that uses Bayesian inference to construct a probabilistic model of the objective function. This method can be used to optimize hyperparameters in machine learning models, which can include seed values. However, the text does not explicitly state whether a seed value was optimized or set in the Bayesian optimization process.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does discuss the use of the LSTM model and Bayesian optimization, which can include seed value optimization.
