Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data formats, as indicated by the context. The studies and datasets mentioned focus on image-based species classification of protected Indonesian birds and the recognition of endemic birds.

For instance, the first dataset consists of 1,000 images of 3 bird species, while the second dataset contains 8,057 images of 83 bird species native to Indonesia. Additionally, there are datasets like CUB-200-2011 with 11,788 images of 200 bird species and Birdsnap with 31,320 images of 29 bird species. These datasets are used to train and evaluate deep learning models for bird species recognition.

In terms of image dimensions, the input images are resized to 224 × 224 × 3 and 299 × 299 × 3 for the training and validation sets, respectively. This resizing is done to meet the requirements of the deep learning models being used.

However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that image data formats are primarily used in this particular deep learning pipeline.
