Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline (3DUNetGSFormer) developed by Jamali et al. for complex wetland mapping using generative adversarial networks and Swin transformer. The context consists of excerpts from the article published in the Ecological Informatics journal, which describes the methodology, results, and comparison with other models. However, it does not contain details about the code repository or implementation. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the code repository for this deep learning pipeline.
