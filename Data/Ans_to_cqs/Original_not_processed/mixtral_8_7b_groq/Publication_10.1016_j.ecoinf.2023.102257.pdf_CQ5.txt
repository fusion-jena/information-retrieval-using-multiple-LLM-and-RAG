The provided context does not include specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for wildlife monitoring using camera trap images. The articles mentioned in the context focus on the methods and techniques used for detecting and classifying animals in camera trap images, but they do not specify the datasets used.

However, in general, the datasets commonly used in deep learning for computer vision tasks include MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, CIFAR for object recognition, and ImageNet for large-scale object recognition. These datasets are widely used for training and testing deep learning models for image classification, object detection, and other tasks.

In the context of wildlife monitoring using camera trap images, the datasets used may consist of images collected from camera traps deployed in various locations and environments. These datasets may contain images of different animal species, as well as images without any animals, which can be used for training and testing deep learning models for detecting and classifying animals in the images.

For example, the article by Torney et al. (2019) compares the performance of deep learning and citizen science techniques for counting wildlife in aerial survey images. The dataset used in this study consists of aerial survey images of elephants in Tsavo, Kenya. Similarly, the article by Vecvanags et al. (2022) focuses on ungulate detection and species classification from camera trap images using RetinaNet and faster R-CNN. The dataset used in this study consists of camera trap images of ungulates in Latvia.

Therefore, while the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for wildlife monitoring using camera trap images are not mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that the datasets used may consist of camera trap images of various animal species collected from different locations and environments.
