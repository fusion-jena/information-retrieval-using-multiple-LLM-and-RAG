Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the model was trained to classify plant species and identify new incoming unknown species using a pre-trained model.

In general, preprocessing steps for training deep learning models can include:

1. Normalization: This involves scaling the input data to a range of values, often between 0 and 1, to improve the model's training efficiency and prevent the exploding/vanishing gradient problem.
2. Scaling: This is similar to normalization, but it involves changing the range of the input data while preserving the distribution.
3. Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values in the input data.
4. Data augmentation: This involves creating new synthetic data from the existing data to increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's generalization ability.

Without specific information from the context, it is difficult to say which of these preprocessing steps were taken before training the deep learning model in question. However, it is mentioned that the model was based on a pre-trained model, which suggests that some form of preprocessing may have been done during the creation of the pre-trained model.
