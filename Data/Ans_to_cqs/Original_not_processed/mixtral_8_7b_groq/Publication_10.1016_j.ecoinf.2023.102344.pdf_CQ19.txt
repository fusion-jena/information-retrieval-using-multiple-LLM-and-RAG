The context provided does not give specific information about the deep learning frameworks used to build the models. However, it mentions several types of networks and techniques used in the models, such as residual connections, bottleneck architecture, global average pooling, and pre-trained networks like EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobilNetV2, and InceptionV3. These networks and techniques can be implemented in various deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. Therefore, while the context does not provide a direct answer to the query, it can be inferred that one or more of these frameworks were used to build the models.
