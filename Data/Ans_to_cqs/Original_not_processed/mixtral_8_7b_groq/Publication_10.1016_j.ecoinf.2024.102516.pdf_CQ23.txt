Answer:::

The text provided does not give a detailed description of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model was tested on two different datasets (GBIF Natural and GBIF Preserved) and that the results were averaged over three repetitions. This suggests that some steps were taken to ensure the model's performance was not dependent on a specific dataset or random initialization.

Additionally, the authors compared their method to a simpler approach using a ResNet50 model pre-trained on the ImageNet classification dataset. This comparison provides some insight into the model's ability to generalize, as the ImageNet dataset is quite different from the plant cover datasets used in the study.

However, there is no explicit mention of techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or the use of a diverse dataset to improve generalizability. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer based on the information given.
