Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on a survey on missing data in machine learning and a specific model that uses a neural network to learn neighborhood relationships. While the model uses existing data and historical databases, the context does not specify where this data is stored or how it can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
