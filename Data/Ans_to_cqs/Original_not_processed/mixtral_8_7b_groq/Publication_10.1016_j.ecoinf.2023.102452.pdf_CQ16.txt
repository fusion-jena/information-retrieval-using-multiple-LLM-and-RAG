Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the forecasting models used in the study. However, it does mention that the Eureka Pro software is used for Genetic Programming (GP) modeling and FIPSO is used as a trainer for Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models.

In the case of GP, the software extracts the inputs utilized in the optimal GP tree and utilizes them as the optimal inputs for modeling with ANN. The primary reason for selecting GP as the Input Variable Selection (IVS) technique is its ability to simultaneously select appropriate features and perform modeling tasks.

For ANN, a standard data split was employed, where 70% of the available data was used for model training, and the remaining 30% was dedicated to testing and evaluating the results. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of FIPSO as a trainer for ANN models.

In general, for neural networks, training is often stopped when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model is starting to overfit the training data. This is typically done using early stopping, where training is halted when the validation loss does not improve for a certain number of epochs.

In the case of GP, the criteria for stopping training could be related to the complexity of the generated models or the performance on the validation set. However, the provided context does not give specific information on this.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the forecasting models used in the study, it can be inferred that for ANN, a standard data split was employed and training was stopped when the validation loss plateaued or started to increase. For GP, the criteria for stopping training could be related to the complexity of the generated models or the performance on the validation set.
