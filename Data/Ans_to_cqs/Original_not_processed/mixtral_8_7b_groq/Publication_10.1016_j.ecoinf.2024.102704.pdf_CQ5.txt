Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipelines are not explicitly mentioned. However, some of the studies suggest the use of custom datasets.

For instance, Palmer et al. (2021) used a high-resolution monitoring dataset of fish length and catch numbers from landings. Similarly, Patton et al. (2023) utilized a dataset of cetacean species for photo-identification. Qin et al. (2022) developed a fish detection method based on multi-enhancement and output fusion of fuzzy underwater images. Rani et al. (2024) proposed a novel automated approach for fish biomass estimation in turbid environments through deep learning, object detection, and regression.

These studies suggest that the deep learning pipelines used in fish and cetacean research often involve custom datasets tailored to the specific research questions. These datasets may include images, length and catch numbers, or other relevant information.

In summary, while the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipelines are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is evident that custom datasets are often used in fish and cetacean research.
