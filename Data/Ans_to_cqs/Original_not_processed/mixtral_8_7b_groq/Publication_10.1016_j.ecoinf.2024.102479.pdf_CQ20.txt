Answer:::

The provided context does not offer specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context contains a table listing the hyperparameters tuned for each algorithm in seven different models, including a deep learning model (Artificial Neural Network, or Model 5). However, it does not mention any details about the hardware used for training these models.

Deep learning models typically require substantial computational power for training, and this power is often provided by specialized hardware, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). GPUs are popular for deep learning due to their ability to perform many calculations simultaneously, which is useful for handling the large matrices and vectors in deep learning algorithms. TPUs are custom-built by Google for machine learning tasks and can offer even greater performance than GPUs for certain tasks.

However, the context provided for this question does not allow us to determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or some other hardware were used for training the deep learning model.
