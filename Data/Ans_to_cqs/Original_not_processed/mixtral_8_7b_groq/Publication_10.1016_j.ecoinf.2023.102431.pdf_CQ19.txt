Based on the provided context, there is no information about the development of a deep learning model using frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context discusses the use of Footprint Identification Technology (FIT) as a non-invasive tool in wildlife conservation, with a focus on the investigation, methodology, and data curation involved in developing and using this technology. The authors declare no known competing financial interests or personal relationships, and data will be made available on request.

The text describes the use of a stepwise variable selection procedure and linear discriminant analysis to generate a discrimination line or hyperplane for species or sex classification, as well as the generation of bands of uncertainty and the assignment of probability values for classification certainty. However, there is no mention of deep learning models or frameworks used for their development.

Therefore, we cannot provide an answer to the query regarding the frameworks used to build the deep learning model as there is no information provided in the context to support an answer.
