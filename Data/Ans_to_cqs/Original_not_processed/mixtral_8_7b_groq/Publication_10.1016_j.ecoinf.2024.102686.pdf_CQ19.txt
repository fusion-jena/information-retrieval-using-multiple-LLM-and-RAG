Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context focuses on the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) network, which is a type of artificial neural network used for clustering and visualization of high-dimensional data. The SOM network is initialized with random connection weights and an initial neighborhood for each output neuron. Then, a new input sample vector is provided, and the Euclidean distances between the input sample and each output neuron are calculated. The neuron with the minimum distance is the winning output unit. The neighborhood and renewal weight of the winning neurons and neurons in the neighborhood are then provided. The learning rate, denoted as Î·(t), decreases with time. The SOM network is used to determine the number of categories in unsupervised clustering, which significantly affects the clustering results. The model is evaluated based on its ability to capture features and patterns in the data and its accuracy. However, the context does not mention any specific deep learning frameworks used for building the model.
