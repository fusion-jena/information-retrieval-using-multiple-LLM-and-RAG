The provided context does not include information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of data and various data sources, as well as the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in a study.

The AI model mentioned in the context could be trained on different hardware platforms, such as Central Processing Units (CPUs), Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). CPUs are general-purpose processors found in most computers, while GPUs and TPUs are specialized processors designed to accelerate specific types of computations, like those encountered in deep learning models.

In the absence of specific details in the context, it is not possible to definitively say which hardware resources were used for training the deep learning model. However, given the complexity of the analysis and the involvement of AI, it is reasonable to assume that GPUs or TPUs were employed to handle the computational demands of the model training process.
