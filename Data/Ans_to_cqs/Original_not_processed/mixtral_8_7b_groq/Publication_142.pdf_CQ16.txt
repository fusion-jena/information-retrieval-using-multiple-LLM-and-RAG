Answer:::

The criteria used to determine when training is complete in a machine learning model can include the validation loss plateauing. This means that the model's performance on the validation set, which is a subset of the training data used to test the model's generalization during training, stops improving or reaches a satisfactory level. The model's weights and biases are then saved, and this version of the model is used for making predictions on new, unseen data.

In addition to the validation loss plateauing, other criteria that can be used to determine when training is complete include the number of epochs, which is the number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset, or the early stopping method. The early stopping method involves specifying a threshold for the number of epochs or the amount of improvement on the validation loss, and if the model does not improve beyond this threshold, training is stopped.

These criteria are used to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and performs poorly on new, unseen data. Overfitting can be reduced by using regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, or by using dropout in neural networks.

The paper "Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift" (arXiv, 1502.03167) discusses a technique for improving the training of deep neural networks by reducing internal covariate shift, which is the change in the distribution of the network's inputs during training. This technique involves normalizing the inputs of each layer before they are passed to the next layer, which helps to improve the stability and speed of training.

The paper "Plant Identification Using Deep Learning and Herbarium Specimens" (Patterns 1, 100116, October 9, 2020) discusses the use of deep learning models for identifying plants based on herbarium specimens. The authors used a dataset from Pl@antNet, which is a platform for plant identification, and evaluated the model's performance on a test dataset. They used the validation loss as a criterion for determining when training was complete, and they also used data augmentation and transfer learning to improve the model's performance.

In the study "A machine learning approach for the automated identification of invasive species from herbarium specimens" (Botella et al., 2020), the authors used a machine learning model to identify invasive plant species based on herbarium specimens. They used a threshold classiÔ¨Åcation score to filter the data, and they evaluated the model's performance on a test dataset. They also discussed the potential for generalizing their approach to a larger geographical scale and other social networks.

In summary, the criteria used to determine when training is complete in a machine learning model can include the validation loss plateauing, the number of epochs, and the early stopping method. These criteria are used to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization to new, unseen data. Other techniques, such as regularization, data augmentation, and transfer learning, can also be used to improve the model's performance.
