Answer:::

The deep learning model is trained using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Specifically, the model utilizes a GPU and CUDA version 11.4 for computation. This information is provided in the first piece of context, which describes the hardware and software environment used for training the model. No other types of hardware resources, such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), are mentioned in the context. Therefore, based on the provided information, GPUs are the only identified hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.
