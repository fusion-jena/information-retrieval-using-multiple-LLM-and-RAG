Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. The text focuses on comparing the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and a conventional SDM (BIOCLIM) in predicting the probability distribution of the plant species Rhododendron arboreum. It describes the data sources, input parameters, and evaluation metrics used in the study, but it does not mention where the code repository can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
