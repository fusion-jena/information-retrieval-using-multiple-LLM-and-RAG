Answer:::
The context provided does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The text focuses on the test set performances, model calibration, and the definition of conservation indices.

However, it is mentioned that the training stops at the best epoch previously determined on the validation set. This suggests that some form of validation-based early stopping might be in use, but the specific condition (like a validation loss plateau) is not specified.
