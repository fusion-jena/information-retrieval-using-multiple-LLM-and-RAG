Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training typically include training, validation, and test datasets. However, the specific details of how the data was split in the given context are not provided.

In general, the training dataset is used to train the model by adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the error on the training data. The validation dataset, also known as the development or tuning dataset, is used to evaluate the model during the training process and adjust the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance. The test dataset, also known as the hold-out dataset, is used to evaluate the final model's performance on unseen data.

In the given context, Table 2 reports the mean F1 scores obtained per dataset split, including training, validation, and three types of test datasets (test-over_time, test-over_location, and test-over_source). The F1 score is a measure of the accuracy of a binary classification model, calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The standard deviations of the F1 scores are also reported, indicating the variability of the scores across different dataset splits.

The high F1 scores obtained by the model on the training and validation datasets suggest that the model was able to learn the patterns in the data and generalize well to the validation data. The scores for the test datasets, while lower than the training and validation scores, are still high, indicating that the model's performance is consistent across different dataset splits.

The specific criteria used to split the data, such as the percentage of samples assigned to each dataset or the random seed used for splitting, are not provided in the given context. However, it is mentioned that the data used in the study, the code used in the analysis, and the trained machine learning model were published, which may allow for further investigation of the data splitting criteria.

In summary, while the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not provided in the given context, the reported F1 scores suggest that the model was able to learn the patterns in the data and generalize well to unseen data.
