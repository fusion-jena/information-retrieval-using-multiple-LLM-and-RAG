Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated which specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in the study. However, there are some indications that suggest that some steps were taken to ensure the model's ability to perform well on unseen data.

Firstly, the study used a large dataset consisting of historical data from 1981 to 2015, which includes various ecological indicators in the lower Heihe River basin. The use of a diverse and large dataset can help the model to learn a wide range of patterns and relationships in the data, which can improve its ability to generalize to new data.

Secondly, the study used a technique called "random dropouts" in each layer of the BO-LSTM model. This technique involves randomly dropping out some neurons during training, which helps to prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize.

Thirdly, the study used a technique called SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret the model's outputs. SHAP is a method for interpreting the output of machine learning models by quantifying the importance of each feature in the model's prediction. This technique can help to ensure that the model is relying on relevant and meaningful features in the data, which can improve its ability to generalize.

Lastly, the study used a technique called scenario analysis of oasis NDVI, which involves running multiple predictions and constructing a 95% confidence interval. This technique can help to assess the variability of the model's predictions and provide a measure of uncertainty, which can be useful for evaluating the model's generalizability.

Overall, while the context does not provide explicit details on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, there are some indications that suggest that the study took steps to prevent overfitting, use a diverse dataset, interpret the model's outputs, and assess the variability of the model's predictions. These steps can all contribute to improving the model's ability to generalize to new data.
