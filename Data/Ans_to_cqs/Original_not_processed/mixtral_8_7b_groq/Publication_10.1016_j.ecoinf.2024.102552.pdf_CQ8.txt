Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository where the implementation of such a pipeline can be found. The authors of the study discussed the use of machine learning methods for image classification, but they did not specify the use of deep learning techniques. They mainly used QGIS version 3.22.4 and R version 4.2.0 for image processing, validation calculations, analysis, and visualization.

The authors did mention the potential of using machine learning tools with online spectral libraries and remote sensing products for refining classifications. However, they cautioned that the success of machine learning methods depends on the quality of their inputs, and they emphasized the need for a method to incorporate all sources of uncertainty into the final result.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. The study mainly focused on using QGIS and R for image processing and analysis, and it discussed the potential of using machine learning methods for image classification.
