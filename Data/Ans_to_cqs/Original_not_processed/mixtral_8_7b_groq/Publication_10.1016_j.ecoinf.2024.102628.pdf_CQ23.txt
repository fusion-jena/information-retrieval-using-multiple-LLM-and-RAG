To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model for the classification of 2D point cloud images, several measures were taken.

Firstly, the study employed a diverse dataset. The dataset was expanded by tripling the image pool for each transect, incorporating multi-temporal data from a three-month span (March, September, and October 2015) across three different environments. This strategy allowed for a more effective training and testing of deep learning models, which inherently require many images to learn effectively.

Secondly, the study utilized a robust cross-validation method, specifically, the Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) approach. In this approach, a complete 450 m multitemporal transect was omitted from the training process in each iteration and subsequently tested. This method ensured an assessment of the model’s performance, accounting for the data constraints and guaranteeing that every multitemporal transect undergoes testing. It is worth noting that models were retrained for each fold, preventing previous fold’s information from being transferred, which further enhances the model’s generalizability.

Moreover, the study utilized a pretrained ResNet-34 architecture, which is a variant of the ResNet (Residual Network) family, widely used for deep learning tasks, particularly in computer vision. Transfer learning, which generally consists of using a model pre-trained on broad datasets, like ImageNet, to specialized tasks with more limited data, was employed. This technique leverages existing knowledge, particularly useful in the study's dataset, given its small size.

In summary, the study ensured the generalizability of the deep learning model by utilizing a diverse dataset, a robust cross-validation method, and transfer learning techniques. These measures helped to ensure that the model can perform well on unseen data, thereby increasing its generalizability.
