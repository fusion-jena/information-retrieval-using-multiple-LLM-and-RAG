Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide information about the learning rate, which is a hyperparameter that can be adjusted in optimization algorithms. The learning rate for the segmentation model is 0.008, and for the classification model, it is 0.0001.

In general, optimization techniques are crucial in training deep learning models to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual values, also known as the loss function. Some popular optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam. These optimization algorithms update the model's parameters by taking steps in the direction that reduces the loss function.

The learning rate determines the size of these steps, and selecting an appropriate learning rate is essential for efficient and effective training. A learning rate that is too small may result in slow convergence, while a learning rate that is too large may cause the model to converge to a suboptimal solution or even diverge.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can infer that an optimization technique is used in the deep learning pipeline, and the learning rate is set to 0.008 for the segmentation model and 0.0001 for the classification model. However, the specific optimization technique is not mentioned.
