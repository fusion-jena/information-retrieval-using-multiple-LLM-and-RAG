Answer:

The provided context does not mention the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the described pipeline. The focus of the text is primarily on statistical models and machine learning techniques, specifically multiple linear regression, Enet, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), XGboost, and LightGBM. These models are used to predict canopy cover from planet data. Therefore, based on the given context, it can be concluded that no deep learning models were used in this study.
