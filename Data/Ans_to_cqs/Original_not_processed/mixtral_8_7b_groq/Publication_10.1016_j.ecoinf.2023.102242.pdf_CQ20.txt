The provided context does not include specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that processing high-resolution remote sensing data can be challenging due to significant time and cost requirements. To address the challenges of data processing, the study employed feature optimization tools, but there is no mention of the specific hardware resources used.

In general, training deep learning models can be computationally intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, specialized hardware such as graphics processing units (GPUs) or tensor processing units (TPUs) are often used to accelerate the training process. GPUs are particularly well-suited for deep learning tasks due to their ability to perform parallel computations, which can significantly reduce training times compared to using a central processing unit (CPU) alone. TPUs are custom-built hardware developed by Google specifically for machine learning tasks and can provide even greater performance than GPUs for certain applications.

Therefore, while the provided context does not specify the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, it is common practice to use specialized hardware such as GPUs or TPUs to accelerate the training process.
