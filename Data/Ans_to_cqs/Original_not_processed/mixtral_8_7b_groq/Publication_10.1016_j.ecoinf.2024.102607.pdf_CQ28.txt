Answer:::
The deep learning model, referred to as the SSA-TPRF model, was deployed on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. This information is derived from the initial context, which states that the SSA-TPRF model was deployed on the GEE platform. The GEE is a nonprofit cloud-computing platform for geospatial analysis, offering an extensive repository of Earth observation data, various classification algorithms, and robust cloud-computing capabilities. Therefore, the SSA-TPRF model was deployed on the Google Earth Engine platform.
