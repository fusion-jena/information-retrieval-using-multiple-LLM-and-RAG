Based on the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation) are not explicitly stated. However, we can infer some potential criteria based on the context.

The data seems to be related to the study of permafrost and its various factors such as soil particle size, soil temperature, soil water input, vegetation density/height, snow depth, and mean annual temperature, among others. It is possible that the data is split based on geographical locations (North, East, South, West) or climate scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5). The data might also be split based on the states of the variables (Low, Medium, High) or the presence or absence of snow.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of terms like "Chance" which could imply that the data is split based on some probabilistic criteria. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.

In general, when splitting data for deep learning model training, it is important to ensure that the splits are representative of the overall data distribution. This typically involves randomly splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model performance. The exact split ratios can vary, but a common approach is to use 60-70% of the data for training, 10-15% for validation, and 15-20% for testing.

In conclusion, while the specific criteria used to split the data in this case are not provided, it is important to ensure that the splits are representative of the overall data distribution and follow best practices for deep learning model training.
