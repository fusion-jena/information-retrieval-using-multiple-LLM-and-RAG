Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context focuses on the description of a method called DEPP (Deep Evolutionary Placement of Phylogenetic Trees) and related concepts in the field of phylogenetics.

In DEPP, the data annotation process likely involves the creation of distance matrices between input query sequences and reference sequences in a phylogenetic tree. The distances are calculated using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which maps query sequences to vectors of distances. Two sets of distances are computed: one with gap reconstruction and one without. The final distances are determined by taking a weighted sum of the two sets, with the weight proportional to the number of sites with gaps in the query sequences.

The annotation process in this context is focused on calculating distances between sequences and taxa in a phylogenetic tree, rather than using techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation that are commonly used in computer vision tasks.
