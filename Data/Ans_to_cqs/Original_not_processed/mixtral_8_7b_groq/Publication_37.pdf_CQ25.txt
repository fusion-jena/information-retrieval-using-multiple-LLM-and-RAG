Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this study is large-vocabulary bird species classification from flight calls. The model is a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with data augmentation. The CNN is designed to optimize cross-entropy loss via mini-batch stochastic gradient descent, using a constant learning rate of 0.01, dropout with probability 0.5 for the input of the last two layers, and L2-regularization with a penalty factor of 0.001 for the weights of the last two layers. The model is trained for 100 epochs, and the parameter setting achieving the highest classification accuracy is identified using a validation set. The CNN is implemented in Python using Lasagne, and data stream multiplexing is implemented using Pescador. The deep learning model is compared with a "shallow learning" approach based on unsupervised dictionary learning and a baseline model based on MFCCs. The study shows that the deep learning model performs comparably with the other model, significantly outperforming the MFCC baseline, in classifying 5428 flight calls spanning 43 different species.
