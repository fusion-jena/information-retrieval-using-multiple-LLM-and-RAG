Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the post-processing steps involved immediately after model training. However, it does mention some quality checks, manual inspection, and data formatting that are performed after the classification steps.

To answer the query, let's first recap the workflow:

1. Pre-processing of images
2. Classification 1 – Image quality and animal presence/absence
3. Classification 2 – Animal species identification
4. Manual quality checks, inspection, and data formatting

Considering the context and general machine learning practices, we can infer some possible post-processing steps that might be involved after model training:

**Model Training Post-Processing Steps:**

* **Model Evaluation Metrics Calculation:** After training the model, it's essential to evaluate its performance using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, as mentioned in Table 4. These metrics help assess the model's ability to classify images correctly.

* **Confusion Matrix:** A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model. It can be used to calculate various metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1 score. The confusion matrix compares the actual class labels with the predicted class labels, allowing for a better understanding of where the model might be making errors.

* **Saliency Maps (optional):** Saliency maps are a technique used to visualize the parts of an input image that are most important for a model's prediction. While the context does not explicitly mention saliency maps, they can be a helpful tool for understanding and debugging models.

* **Hyperparameter Tuning (optional):** Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned from the data but set before the learning process begins. Based on the performance of the initial model, one might want to tune these hyperparameters to improve the model's performance.

After these post-processing steps, the workflow moves on to manual quality checks, inspection, and data formatting.

Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the explicit post-processing steps after model training include model evaluation metrics calculation. However, other common post-processing steps, such as confusion matrix generation, hyperparameter tuning, and saliency map generation, might also be involved. After these steps, manual quality checks, inspection, and data formatting are performed.
