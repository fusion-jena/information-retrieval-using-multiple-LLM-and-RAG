Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context focuses on the Fire Weather Index (FWI) and Fire Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) data layers, vegetation, and human impact in the development of a system. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to the query.

However, it is important to note that deep learning model training often requires substantial computational power, which is typically provided by specialized hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). These hardware components can significantly speed up the training process compared to using only CPUs.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not offer information on the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, it is common practice to use GPUs or TPUs for deep learning model training due to their computational advantages.
