Answer: During the training of the classification model for plant species identification, several strategies were implemented to monitor the model's performance.

Firstly, the training process was divided into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The model was trained using one set, and its performance was evaluated using the other two sets. This approach allowed for the monitoring of the model's performance on unseen data, ensuring that the model was not overfitting to the training data.

Secondly, the model's performance was evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provided a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance, highlighting any strengths or weaknesses in specific categories.

Thirdly, the model's performance was monitored throughout the training process using a technique called early stopping. This technique involves stopping the training process if the model's performance on the validation set does not improve for a certain number of epochs. This approach prevented the model from overfitting to the training data and improved the model's generalization ability.

Fourthly, data augmentation techniques such as height and width shift, flipping, zooming, and brightness changes were used during the training process. These techniques increased the diversity of the training data, preventing overfitting and improving the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Lastly, the training process was carried out using a powerful computing facility equipped with an AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3960 Ã— 24-Core Processor, 64GB RAM, and two NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080 SUPER GPUs. This setup allowed for efficient training and monitoring of the model's performance.

In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model's performance during training involved dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets, evaluating the model's performance using various metrics, implementing early stopping, using data augmentation techniques, and carrying out the training process using a powerful computing facility.
