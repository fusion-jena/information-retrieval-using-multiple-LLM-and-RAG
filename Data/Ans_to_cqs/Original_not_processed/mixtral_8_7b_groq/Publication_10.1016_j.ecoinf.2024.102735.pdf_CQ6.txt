Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of high-frequency continuous surface water quality data, such as pH and turbidity, for training machine learning models. It can be inferred that these data were used as input to the models without any specific preprocessing steps being mentioned.

In the context of machine learning and deep learning, data preprocessing can include various steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization is the process of rescaling numeric columns in the data so that they fall within a specific range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling involves resizing the features so they have equal importance and fall within the same range. Data cleaning includes handling missing values, outliers, and duplicate data points.

In this study, the authors used a random forest (RF) model to predict chlorophyll-a concentrations using water quality data. They mentioned that the most occurring max\_depth when using the manually sampled dataset was 28, which increased to 37 when more datasets were used to train the model. This suggests that the authors may have performed some level of data preprocessing, such as feature selection, to determine the optimal depth of the trees in the random forest model.

Additionally, the authors mentioned that the inclusion of chlorophyll-a sensor values as a predictor variable made little impact on the parameter distribution for both RF\_with\_Sensor and RF\_w/o\_Sensor. This suggests that the data may have been preprocessed to ensure that the inclusion of the chlorophyll-a sensor values did not significantly affect the model's performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model, it can be inferred that some level of data preprocessing, such as feature selection, may have been performed. However, specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and data cleaning are not mentioned.
