The provided context discusses various aspects of a deep learning pipeline, including the use of dimensionality reduction algorithms, active learning strategies, and model architectures. However, it does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.

Regularization methods are essential to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization techniques help to reduce overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the hidden units in a layer to zero during training. This prevents the model from relying too much on any single neuron and encourages the model to learn more robust features. Dropout has been shown to improve the performance of deep neural networks significantly.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which in turn reduces the complexity of the model and helps to prevent overfitting.

The context does mention the use of hyperparameters in deep learning algorithms. Hyperparameters are parameters that are set before training and control the learning process. Regularization techniques can be viewed as hyperparameters since they control the complexity of the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, dropout and L2 regularization are two common regularization techniques used in deep learning. Dropout prevents overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of the hidden units in a layer to zero during training, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. Hyperparameters, including regularization techniques, control the learning process in deep learning algorithms.
