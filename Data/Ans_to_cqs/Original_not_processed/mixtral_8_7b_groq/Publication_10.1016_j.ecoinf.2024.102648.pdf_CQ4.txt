Based on the provided context, the specific deep learning techniques or data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are not mentioned. However, it is stated that in a study, machine learning (bootstrap forest, boosted tree) and deep learning (artificial neural network) models were employed to forecast the percent disease incidence of Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD) under the prevailing weather data. The weather parameters recorded from 2011 to 2019 at weather stations based at all four locations were used for calculating the Growing Degree Days (GDD) as per the following equations.

It is also mentioned that some researchers have used ML, DL, and model combination techniques to identify, monitor and estimate plant disease severity under field conditions, and Revathi and Hemalatha (2014) and Caldeira et al. (2021) have used ML that encompasses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

So, based on general practice in deep learning, data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used to increase the amount of training data, improve model accuracy, and prevent overfitting. These techniques involve creating new training examples by applying random transformations to the original images, such as horizontal or vertical flipping, rotating by a certain degree, zooming in or out (scaling), and translating (shifting) the images. These techniques can be applied to the input data in the deep learning pipeline to improve the model's ability to generalize and increase its accuracy.
