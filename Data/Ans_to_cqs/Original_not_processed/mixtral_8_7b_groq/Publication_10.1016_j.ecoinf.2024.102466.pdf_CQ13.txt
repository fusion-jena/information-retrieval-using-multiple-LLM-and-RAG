Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention the use of different models including Cascade RCNN, Faster RCNN, Sparse RCNN, FCOS, RetinaNet, ATSS, and RepPoints for object detection on camera trap images.

In general, hyperparameters used in deep learning models can include learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizer, loss function, and regularization techniques. The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. The optimizer is an algorithm used to update the model's weights based on the gradient of the loss function. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.

The number of epochs, or the number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset, is another important hyperparameter. The context suggests that the optimal number of epochs for the models used in the study is around 10, as most models reached their maximum mean average precision (mAP) score by this point.

Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization or dropout, can also be used to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance. However, the context does not provide information on whether these techniques were used in the models.

Therefore, while the context provides information on the effectiveness of different deep learning models for object detection on camera trap images, it does not give specific details on the hyperparameters used in these models.
