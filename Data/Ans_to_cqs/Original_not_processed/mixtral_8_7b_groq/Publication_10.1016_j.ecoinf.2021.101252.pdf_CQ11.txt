Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The sources given mainly focus on the methodology, applications, and performance of deep learning models in various case studies. They do not mention any data repository or data sharing platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific data repository link related to the deep learning pipeline.
