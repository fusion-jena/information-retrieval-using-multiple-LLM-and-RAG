Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the image quality model were optimized. The text only provides the performance metrics of the model on the test data, including precision, recall, and F1 scores for two locations (Finnmark and Yamal) and two image quality categories (Bad and Good).

However, it is common to optimize hyperparameters in machine learning models using methods such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves systematically trying out different combinations of hyperparameters in a grid-like pattern. Random search, on the other hand, involves randomly selecting hyperparameters from a defined range. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic approach to select hyperparameters that are likely to result in good model performance.

Therefore, while the specific method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the image quality model is not provided in the context, it is possible that one of these methods was used. It would be important to consult the original research paper or the model developers to obtain more information about the hyperparameter optimization process.
