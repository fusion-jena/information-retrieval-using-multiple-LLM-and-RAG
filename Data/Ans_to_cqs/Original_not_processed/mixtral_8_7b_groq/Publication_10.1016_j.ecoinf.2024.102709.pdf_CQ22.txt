Answer:::

The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using two metrics: Focal Loss and Classification Loss (cls loss).

Focal Loss is a type of loss function that helps the network learn the probabilities of the values around the continuous locations of the target bounding boxes. It focuses on the values near a label y by explicitly increasing the probabilities of yi and yi + 1. This metric is used for the bounding box estimation.

Classification Loss (cls loss), on the other hand, measures the error in the predicted class probabilities for each object in the image compared with the ground truth. When it is lower, the model is more accurate in predicting the class of the objects. This value was computed using a cross-entropy loss function.

In addition, the performance of the model is also evaluated using mAP50 values. mAP50 indicates the highest number of correctly predicted labels for the model trained on a specific split. The split with the highest mAP50 value indicates the highest performance of the model.

It is worth noting that the performance of the model was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation, where the data were split into k different training-test sets. The model was not trained on the entire dataset but on each training split. This method was used to determine the best data split for the model.

Therefore, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using Focal Loss, Classification Loss, and mAP50 values, along with k-fold cross-validation.
