Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used to build the model. The focus of the text is on the methodology and evaluation of a species distribution model using machine learning techniques.

The model optimization process involved feature classes 'L', 'Q', 'LQ', 'LQP', and regularization multipliers ranging from 0.5 to 5. Model performance was assessed using the delta.AICc metric, Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), and Continuous Boyce Index (CBI). The final optimal parameters were identified as the feature class 'LQP' and a regularization multiplier of 3.5.

While the text does mention the use of the 'scikit-learn' library for cross-validation, it does not specify any deep learning frameworks. It is possible that the authors implemented custom machine learning algorithms or used other libraries that are not explicitly mentioned in the text.
