Answer:::

In the deep learning pipeline, several optimization techniques are employed to effectively train models and improve their performance. These techniques are primarily used during the training phase of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to minimize the loss function and enhance the model's accuracy. Some of the commonly used optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and other variants such as RMSProp, Adadelta, Adagrad, and Adamax.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular optimization algorithm that iteratively updates the model's parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function concerning each parameter. SGD's primary advantage is its simplicity and efficiency, making it a suitable choice for large-scale machine learning problems. However, it may not always converge to the optimal solution due to its stochastic nature.

Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is another optimization technique that combines the advantages of SGD and other methods like Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp). Adam estimates the first and second moments of the gradient to adapt the learning rate for each parameter. This adaptive learning rate allows Adam to achieve faster convergence and better performance compared to SGD in many scenarios.

The search space of CNN hyperparameters, as presented in the context, includes several optimization algorithms: ADAM, SGD, RMSProp, Adadelta, Adagrad, and Adamax. These algorithms are used as CNN Model Optimizers in the deep learning pipeline. The choice of the optimizer depends on the specific problem, dataset, and the desired trade-off between convergence speed, computational efficiency, and model performance.

In summary, optimization techniques like SGD, Adam, and other variants play a crucial role in the deep learning pipeline. They help train CNNs by minimizing the loss function and adapting the learning rate for each parameter. The selection of the optimizer depends on the specific problem requirements and the desired trade-offs.
