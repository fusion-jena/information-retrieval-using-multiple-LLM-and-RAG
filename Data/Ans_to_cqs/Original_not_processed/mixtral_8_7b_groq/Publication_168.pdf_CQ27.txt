The text provided does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model after it has been created. However, it does mention that the model is trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and is used for the classification of forest species in hyperspectral images captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

The training samples were used to learn the weights and biases of the network, and the test samples were used to evaluate the classification performance. The data was split into training and test sets with a ratio of 1:9.

As for the deployment of the model, the text does not provide information on whether the model was serialized, and if so, what format was used for serialization. It also does not mention any details about the platform on which the model was deployed.

In general, when deploying a deep learning model, there are several steps that can be taken:

1. Model serialization: This involves saving the model architecture and learned parameters to disk so that it can be loaded and used for making predictions on new data. Common formats for model serialization include HDF5, JSON, and XML.
2. Platform selection: The next step is to choose a platform on which to deploy the model. This could be a local machine, a cloud-based platform, or an edge device. The choice of platform will depend on the specific requirements of the application, such as the need for low latency, high throughput, or the ability to run the model offline.
3. Model optimization: Depending on the platform, it may be necessary to optimize the model to improve its performance. This could involve techniques such as quantization, pruning, or distillation.
4. Integration with other systems: Finally, the model may need to be integrated with other systems, such as a web application or a mobile app, to provide a complete solution.

Without more information from the text, it is not possible to say for sure what steps were taken to deploy the model in this case. However, the general process for deploying a deep learning model involves serializing the model, choosing a platform, optimizing the model, and integrating it with other systems as needed.
