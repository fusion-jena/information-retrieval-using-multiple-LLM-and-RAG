Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, the text does mention some strategies for improving the model that could be related to hyperparameter optimization.

Firstly, the model's update criterion may be modified to make it differentiable while maintaining stochasticity. This modification could be seen as a way to optimize the model's learning process, although it is not explicitly stated as hyperparameter optimization.

Secondly, the scope of the model could be optimized by changing the partitions to expose more cells in each iteration. This adjustable parameter could help improve the accuracy and efficiency of the model.

Lastly, the text mentions the possibility of investigating and developing new estimators for variance reduction using strategies such as importance sampling, stratified sampling, or Quasi-Monte Carlo methods. These strategies could be related to hyperparameter optimization, as they aim to improve the accuracy of the model by reducing the variance of the estimator.

Therefore, while the text does not provide explicit information about hyperparameter optimization methods like grid search or random search, it does suggest some strategies for improving the model that could be related to hyperparameter optimization.
