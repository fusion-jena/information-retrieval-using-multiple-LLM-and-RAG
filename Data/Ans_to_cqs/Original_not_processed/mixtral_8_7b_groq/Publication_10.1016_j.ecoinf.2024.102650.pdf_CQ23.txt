Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some implicit clues that suggest certain measures might have been taken.

Firstly, the study involves the use of a "diverse dataset" as mentioned in the first sentence. This implies that the dataset used in the study is not limited to a specific domain or type of data, which could help in increasing the model's generalizability.

Secondly, the study mentions the use of "text preprocessing, such as word segmentation and stop word removal." These preprocessing steps are often taken to ensure that the model is not learning spurious patterns or noise in the data, which could improve its generalizability.

Thirdly, the study mentions the use of the ERNIE model, which is a model that "learns prior semantic relationships and word order features from massive amounts of data." This suggests that the model might have been trained on a large and diverse dataset, which could help in improving its generalizability.

Finally, the study mentions that the ERNIE model performed better than the bidirectional encoder representations from the transformer model proposed by Google AI. This could imply that the ERNIE model has better generalizability than other models, although this is not explicitly stated in the context.

Therefore, while the context does not provide explicit information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, there are some implicit clues that suggest that diverse dataset, text preprocessing, and training on a large and diverse dataset might have been used. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
