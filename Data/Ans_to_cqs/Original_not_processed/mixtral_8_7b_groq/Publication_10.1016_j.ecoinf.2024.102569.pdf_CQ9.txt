Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text mainly discusses the use of citizen science data platforms, such as eBird, Pl@ntNet, iNaturalist, and Observation.org, which are accessible through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). However, it does not specify where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The context focuses on the challenges and solutions for analyzing citizen science data, including issues like species identification errors, local over-aggregation of records, and heterogeneous observations. It also mentions various ecological factors and statistical models but does not provide information about the data repository. Therefore, I cannot answer this query without additional context.
