Answer:::

The text provided discusses the development of a method for passive monitoring of bird activity, diversity, and acoustic phenology using deep learning. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

However, it does suggest one measure taken to ensure the generalizability of the model. Specifically, it is recommended to reserve monitoring areas for the creation of validation and test sets, avoiding a link with the training data. This approach allows for the correct estimation of the model's generalization and can speed up threshold calibration during production.

Additionally, the authors mention the importance of having numerous and diverse data for estimation methods based on deep learning. This implies that a diverse dataset was used, which can help improve the model's generalizability.

Therefore, while the text does not explicitly mention cross-validation or stratified splitting, it does suggest that the authors took steps to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model by using a diverse dataset and reserving monitoring areas for validation and test sets.
