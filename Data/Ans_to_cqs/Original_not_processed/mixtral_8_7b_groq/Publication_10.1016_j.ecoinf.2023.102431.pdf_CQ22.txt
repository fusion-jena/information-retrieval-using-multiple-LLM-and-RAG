Based on the provided context, the text does not mention the use of a deep learning model for species or sex discrimination. Instead, it describes a method for discriminating species and sex using linear discriminant analysis and logistic regression.

However, the text does provide some information on how the performance of the linear discriminant analysis model is evaluated. According to the context, the model uses a discrimination line or hyperplane to classify species or sex. To quantify uncertainty in classification, bands of uncertainty are generated around this discrimination hyperplane. Values that fall within these bands are assigned a probability value (p) indicating a level of certainty about the classification using a logistic regression model.

Therefore, while the text does not directly answer the query regarding the performance metrics used for a deep learning model, it does suggest that the model's performance is evaluated using probability values and uncertainty bands.

It's worth noting that for other types of classification models, such as deep learning models, common performance metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made, while precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances, and F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. These metrics can provide insight into the model's performance and help identify areas for improvement.
