The specific type of deep learning model used in the study by Ren et al. (2023) is not explicitly mentioned in the title or abstract provided. However, it is mentioned that their study is based on a "deep learning algorithm" for strategic planning. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with many layers (hence "deep") to learn and make predictions or decisions.

There are several types of deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers, among others. CNNs are commonly used for image and video recognition, while RNNs are used for sequential data such as speech and text. Transformers, on the other hand, are a type of model that has gained popularity in recent years for natural language processing tasks.

Without more information about the specific deep learning model used in the study by Ren et al. (2023), it is not possible to provide a more precise answer to the query. However, it is clear that the authors are using some form of deep learning algorithm for their strategic planning in the context of ecosystem service value and changes in food supply and demand in Liaoning Province.
