The provided context does not contain information about the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, in general, there are several common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models, including:

1. Accuracy: This is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. It is a common metric used to evaluate the overall performance of a model.
2. Precision: This is the ratio of the number of true positive predictions (correctly labeled positive instances) to the total number of positive predictions (both true positives and false positives). It is a measure of the exactness of the model.
3. Recall: This is the ratio of the number of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances. It is a measure of the completeness of the model.
4. F1 score: This is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it provides a single metric that balances both precision and recall.
5. Area Under the Curve (AUC): This is a metric used to evaluate the performance of binary classification models. It measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve (a plot of true positive rate vs. false positive rate).
6. Confusion matrix: This is a table used to describe the performance of a classification model. It summarizes the number of false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives.

These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models in various applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and recommendation systems.
