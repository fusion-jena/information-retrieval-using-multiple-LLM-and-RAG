Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a specific code repository for a deep learning pipeline. While the context contains several studies and sources that discuss and apply deep learning techniques in various fields, there is no mention of a shared or publicly available code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket link for the deep learning pipeline. However, the paper by Hakkenberg et al., 2021 (reference number 30) mentions using TensorFlow, an open-source platform for deep learning, to develop their species richness estimation model. You may want to look into TensorFlow's documentation and examples for deep learning pipeline implementation.
