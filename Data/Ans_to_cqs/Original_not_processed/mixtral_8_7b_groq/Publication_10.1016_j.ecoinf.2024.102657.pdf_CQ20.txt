Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, which in this case is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) model. 

However, it is mentioned that they created metadata files and processed spectrograms for training these models. These tasks can be computationally intensive, especially when dealing with large datasets, which suggests that they might have used hardware accelerators like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to speed up the training process.

But, the text does not provide any specific information about the hardware resources used. Therefore, it's not possible to give a definitive answer to this query based on the given context.

Answer::: No specific information is provided in the context about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.
