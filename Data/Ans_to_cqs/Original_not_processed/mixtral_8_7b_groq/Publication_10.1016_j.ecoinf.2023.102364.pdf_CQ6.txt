Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no mention of deep learning models being used in the study. The study primarily focuses on using machine learning ensemble methods such as RandomForest, Treenet, CART, and MARS for predicting the Resource Selection Index (RIO) of Short-billed Gulls. Therefore, I cannot provide specific details about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model for this particular study.

However, I can provide some general preprocessing steps that are commonly involved before training deep learning models:

1. Data cleaning: This involves removing or correcting erroneous or missing data points.
2. Data normalization/scaling: Deep learning models are sensitive to the scale of input features. Therefore, it is essential to normalize or scale the data so that all features have a similar range. Common techniques include min-max scaling, z-score normalization, and scaling to unit length.
3. Data augmentation: This technique is used to increase the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data. It is particularly useful in computer vision tasks where images can be rotated, translated, or flipped to create new training examples.
4. Feature engineering: This involves creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance. For example, polynomial features can be created by taking products of existing features, or categorical features can be encoded as binary vectors.
5. Splitting the dataset: The dataset is typically split into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model performance.
