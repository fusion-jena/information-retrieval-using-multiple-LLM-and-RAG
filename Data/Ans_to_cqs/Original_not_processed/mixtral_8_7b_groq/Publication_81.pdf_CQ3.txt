Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline used in the study to classify fish from different families and determine outgroups using DNA barcode sequences does not explicitly mention any data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, the pipeline focuses on DNA sequence alignment, one-hot encoding, and using Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) for learning data features and obtaining an outgroup score for each object.

However, it is important to note that data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation and instance segmentation are typically used in computer vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation, where the goal is to identify and locate objects within images or videos. In contrast, the deep learning pipeline in this study deals with DNA barcode sequences, which are one-dimensional data, and not images or videos.

Therefore, it is appropriate to say that the context does not provide any information on data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this particular study.
