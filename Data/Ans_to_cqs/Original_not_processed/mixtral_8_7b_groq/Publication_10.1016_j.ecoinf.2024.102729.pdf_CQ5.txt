Based on the provided context, there is no information about the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context focuses on various studies related to environmental pollution, water quality management, and analysis of water coverage in Poyang Lake, China.

In the study "Applications of deep learning in water quality management: A state-of-the-art review" by Wai et al. (2022), the authors discuss various deep learning models and techniques applied to water quality management. However, they do not mention any specific dataset used in these applications.

The study "Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Variation in Water Coverage in the Sub-Lakes of Poyang Lake Based on Multi-Source Remote Sensing" by Wang et al. (2023) analyzes the water coverage in Poyang Lake using multi-source remote sensing data. While this study uses remote sensing data, it does not involve deep learning models or standard deep learning datasets.

Similarly, the study "The application of integrating comprehensive evaluation and clustering algorithms weighted by maximal information coefficient for urban flood susceptibility" by Wang et al. (2023) focuses on urban flood susceptibility and does not involve deep learning datasets.

In summary, the provided context does not contain any information about the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the studies focus on environmental pollution, water quality management, and analysis of water coverage using various techniques and datasets specific to these domains.
