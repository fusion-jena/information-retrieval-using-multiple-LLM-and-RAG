The provided context discusses the use of deep learning for image classification and change detection, specifically using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a focus on input image size, network configuration, and training strategy. However, it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Nonetheless, based on common practices in deep learning for computer vision tasks, we can infer some possible data annotation techniques that might have been employed in this study.

1. Object Detection: Given the mention of objects represented as a single pixel up to larger assemblages, object detection annotations could have been used. Object detection involves drawing bounding boxes around objects of interest in an image. This technique would allow the CNN to learn features and classify objects at different scales.

2. Semantic Segmentation: Although the context states that segmentation-based approaches were considered but not used due to insufficient quality training data, it is still a common data annotation technique in deep learning. Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding class. This method could be useful for identifying and classifying objects at a pixel level, providing more precise location information.

3. Instance Segmentation: Another possible data annotation technique is instance segmentation, which combines object detection and semantic segmentation. Instance segmentation not only labels each pixel in an image with its corresponding class but also differentiates between individual instances of the same class. This technique would enable the CNN to learn features and classify objects with better spatial awareness and differentiation between multiple instances.

Without explicit information from the context, it is challenging to definitively determine the data annotation techniques used in this deep learning pipeline. However, based on the described problem and common practices in deep learning for computer vision tasks, object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation are plausible data annotation techniques that could have been employed.
