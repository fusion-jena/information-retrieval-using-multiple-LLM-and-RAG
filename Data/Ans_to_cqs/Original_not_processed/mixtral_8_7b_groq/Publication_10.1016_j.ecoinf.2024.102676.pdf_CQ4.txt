Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text primarily focuses on footprint identification methods, missing value imputation, and classifying animal species from footprints.

However, data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning, particularly in computer vision tasks, to increase the diversity of the training dataset and improve model generalization. These techniques can be applied to the footprint images to generate new variations by horizontally flipping the images, rotating them at different angles, and scaling (zooming) them in or out.

For example, in the context of classifying three sympatric otter species using deep learning models, a model trained on images of all qualities, including augmented ones, could potentially perform as well as a model trained only on high-quality prints. This highlights the potential of utilizing lower quality data effectively, which can be achieved through data augmentation techniques.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of flipping, rotating, or scaling in the deep learning pipeline, these data augmentation techniques are generally applicable and beneficial in deep learning, particularly for image-based tasks like footprint identification.
