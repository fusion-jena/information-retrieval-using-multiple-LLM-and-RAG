I couldn't find information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline in the provided context. The texts mention various studies and methods related to remote sensing, vegetation indices, atmospheric correction, and machine learning techniques for different applications. However, they do not contain any details about a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository.

Therefore, I would recommend looking at other resources, such as the authors' personal websites, research group pages, or the journal's supplementary materials, if available. Additionally, you can directly contact the authors for more information about their work and the potential code repository.
