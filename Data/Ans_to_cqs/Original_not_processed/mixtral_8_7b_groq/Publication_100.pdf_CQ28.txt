Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the specific platform that was used to deploy the deep learning models. It mentions various studies and methods that use deep learning for remote sensing tasks, such as sea ice concentration estimation, semantic density estimation from Space, and multi-temporal land cover classification with sequential recurrent encoders. However, it does not specify the cloud platforms, if any, that were used to implement these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
