Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the models was evaluated by comparing the W* parameters values of the MLR (Multiple Linear Regression) models M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5. This is based on the given Figures 10, 11, and 12, which illustrate the W* parameters values for each model. Additionally, the authors mentioned that they adopted only 8 of the describing variables for the next tested model, implying a process of selection and evaluation of variables based on the model performance. However, the specific method or metrics used to monitor the model performance during training remains undisclosed in the text.
