Answer:::

The pieces of context provided do not directly refer to the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention some methods used for collecting raw data in the context of digital soil mapping and land cover classification.

In the study by Mohammadi and Toomanian (2016), artificial neural networks were used to extend a database for digital soil mapping. While the specific data collection methods are not mentioned, it can be inferred that they used some form of soil data, possibly from surveys or sensors, to train their neural network model.

Breiman (2001) discussed the use of random forests, an ensemble learning method, for classification and regression tasks. The training data for random forests typically comes from labeled examples, which can be obtained through various methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets.

Carr√© et al. (2007) discussed digital soil assessments beyond digital soil mapping. They mentioned the use of remote sensing data, which is often obtained from sensors on satellites or aircraft, as well as field surveys for data collection.

Clausi (2002) analyzed co-occurrence texture statistics as a function of grey level quantization. The data used in this study likely came from remote sensing images or other sensor data.

Congalton and Green (2009) provided a comprehensive guide on assessing the accuracy of remotely sensed data. This implies the use of remote sensing data, which is typically obtained from sensors on satellites or aircraft.

Liu et al. (2020) proposed a graded proportion method of training sample selection for updating conventional soil maps. They used soil data, likely obtained through surveys or sensors, to train their model.

Lu et al. (2010) performed land cover classification in a complex urban-rural landscape using Quickbird imagery. Quickbird is a high-resolution satellite system, implying the use of remote sensing data.

Lu et al. (2021) focused on optimal segmentation scale selection for hyperspectral image classification. Hyperspectral images are typically obtained through remote sensing.

Saboori et al. (2019) combined multi-scale textural features from high spatial resolution images with ANN and MLC classification algorithms to extract urban land uses. They used remote sensing data, likely from high-resolution satellites or aircraft.

Sheykhmousa et al. (2020) compared support vector machine and random forest classifiers for land use and land cover classification. The data used in this study likely came from remote sensing images or other sensor data.

In summary, the methods used for collecting raw data in the context of the provided pieces of context include surveys, sensors (particularly remote sensing sensors), and public datasets. However, the specific deep learning pipeline is not mentioned, so this answer may not fully address the query.
