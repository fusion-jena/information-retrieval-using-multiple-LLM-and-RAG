The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it discusses a study related to estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) in the Himalayas using machine learning algorithms and remote sensing data. Therefore, I will provide an answer based on the information available in the context.

Answer:::
The data formats used in the study related to estimating AGB in the Himalayas are likely raster data formats, such as GeoTIFF, coming from remote sensing sources. These raster datasets include spectral bands from Landsat satellite imagery available on the EarthExplorer platform (<https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/>) and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model (SRTM DEM) data. These datasets are used to derive various vegetation-derived indices and other relevant variables for the machine learning models.

In summary, the data formats used in the study are raster datasets, primarily from remote sensing sources, which are used to derive various vegetation-related indices and elevation data for the machine learning pipeline.
