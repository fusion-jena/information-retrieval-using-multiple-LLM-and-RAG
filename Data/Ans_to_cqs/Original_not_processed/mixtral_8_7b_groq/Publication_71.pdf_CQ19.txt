Answer: The deep learning model is built using the TensorFlow framework. This information is provided in the context, which states that "a PC with Windows 10 operating system, a GPU card (RTX2070), and 16GB memory is used for DeepLabv3+ model training and testing which uses the TensorFlow framework to run." Therefore, it can be concluded that the TensorFlow framework is used for building the deep learning model.
