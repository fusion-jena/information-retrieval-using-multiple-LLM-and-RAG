Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the machine learning models used in the study. The text focuses on describing the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves of seven machine learning models and does not mention any details about the training process or the specific criteria used to determine training completion.

However, in general, there are various criteria that can be used to determine when training is complete in machine learning models. One common approach is to monitor the validation loss during training and stop training when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model is starting to overfit to the training data. This is a form of early stopping, which can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance.

Another approach is to use a pre-specified number of training iterations or epochs, or to use a learning rate schedule that gradually decreases the learning rate over time. These methods can help ensure that the model has sufficient time to learn the underlying patterns in the data, while also preventing overfitting.

In addition, some machine learning algorithms have built-in stopping criteria based on convergence or other statistical measures. For example, some optimization algorithms may stop training when the gradient of the loss function becomes sufficiently small, indicating that the model has converged to a local minimum.

Overall, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete will depend on the machine learning algorithm and the specific problem at hand. However, the general goal is to find a balance between training the model sufficiently to learn the underlying patterns in the data, while also preventing overfitting and improving the model's generalization performance.
