The provided context does not give specific information about how raw data was collected for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. However, it does mention that the algorithms were trained and tested on a dataset of 6570 pictures, which were divided into a training set of 5256 pictures (80%) and a testing set of 1314 pictures (20%). The pictures were likely taken specifically for this study, but the method of data collection is not specified.

The pictures in the dataset are of triatomine bugs, which are vectors of Chagas disease. The study aimed to test the performance of different algorithms in identifying the bug species using the pictures. The algorithms used include a convolutional neural network (AlexNet), three boosting-based classifiers (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Histogram-based Gradient Boosting), and a linear discriminant model.

The study assessed the identification accuracy and specificity of the algorithms using logit-binomial generalized linear mixed models fit in a Bayesian framework. The results showed that the convolutional neural network (AlexNet) had essentially perfect accuracy and specificity, irrespective of picture angle or bug position. The other algorithms had varying levels of accuracy and specificity, depending on the bug species and picture angle.

In summary, while the context does not provide information on how the raw data was collected, it does mention that the algorithms were trained and tested on a dataset of 6570 pictures of triatomine bugs. The study aimed to test the performance of different algorithms in identifying the bug species using the pictures.
