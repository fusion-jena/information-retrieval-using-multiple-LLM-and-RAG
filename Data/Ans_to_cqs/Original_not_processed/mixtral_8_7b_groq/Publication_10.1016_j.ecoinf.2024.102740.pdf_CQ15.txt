Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. The context mainly focuses on topics related to grassland management, remote sensing, and machine learning techniques like Random Forest (RF).

However, I can provide a brief overview of the optimization techniques mentioned in your query:

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): SGD is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function in machine learning and deep learning models. It works by iteratively updating the model parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function concerning a single training example or a small batch of examples.

2. Adam: Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) is another optimization algorithm for training deep learning models. It is an extension of SGD that adaptively adjusts the learning rate for each parameter. Adam combines the advantages of two other optimization methods, AdaGrad and RMSProp, by using the moving averages of the gradient and the squared gradient to scale the learning rate.

These optimization techniques are crucial for training deep learning models, as they help find the optimal set of model parameters that minimize the loss function and improve the model's generalization performance.
