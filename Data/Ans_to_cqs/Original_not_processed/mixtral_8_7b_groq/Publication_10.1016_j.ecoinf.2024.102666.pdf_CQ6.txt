Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps before training a deep learning model, such as for atmospheric correction (AC) of satellite images, can include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. 

In the context of AC, L2gen requires an accurate understanding of aerosol types to obtain high-quality Rrs retrieval. However, the complex aerosols of particular locations (PL) make this practice less efficient. This implies a cleaning process to remove low-quality pixels, improving search quality. 

The context also mentions the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) for AC, which exhibits considerable variation across diverse aquatic environments. This suggests the need for normalization and scaling techniques to make the data compatible with the deep learning model. 

For instance, the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) model, originally developed for land pixels, has proven effective in AC for aquatic environments utilizing Sentinel-2 and SPOT-6 imagery. The FLAASH algorithm mitigates the spatial proximity effect by employing an internal pixel averaging technique, which is essential for attaining high-quality AC. This can be seen as a form of scaling and normalization, where the pixel values are adjusted based on their spatial proximity. 

In investigations of lacustrine environments using Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) AVNIR-2 data, the efficacy of AC algorithms predicated on the single scattering approximation has been significantly enhanced. This implies a preprocessing step that involves adjusting the parameters based on the varying pixel sizes of water bodies at different resolutions. 

Therefore, before training a deep learning model for AC, preprocessing steps may include:

1. Cleaning: Removing low-quality pixels and improving search quality.
2. Normalization: Adjusting pixel values to make them compatible with the deep learning model.
3. Scaling: Adjusting pixel values based on their spatial proximity or the varying pixel sizes of water bodies at different resolutions.
