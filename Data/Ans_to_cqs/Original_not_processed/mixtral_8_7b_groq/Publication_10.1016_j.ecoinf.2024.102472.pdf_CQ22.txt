The provided context discusses the evaluation of a machine learning model, specifically an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and XGBoost model, for predicting reforestation carbon stock using Planetscope MSI texture metrics. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model in terms of accuracy, precision, or recall.

However, based on the information provided, we can infer that the model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:

1. Mean C (t. ha-1): This appears to be the average carbon stock (in metric tons per hectare) predicted by the model.
2. R2: This is the coefficient of determination, which measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (carbon stock) that can be explained by the independent variable(s) used in the model. An R2 value closer to 1 indicates a better fit of the model to the data.
3. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): This is a measure of the differences between the values predicted by the model and the actual values. A lower RMSE indicates a better fit of the model to the data.
4. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This is another measure of the differences between the predicted and actual values, but it is calculated as the average of the absolute differences, rather than the square of the differences. Like RMSE, a lower MAE indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

It is important to note that while these metrics provide insight into the model's performance, they do not directly assess accuracy, precision, or recall. Accuracy refers to the proportion of true positive predictions made by the model, while precision is the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model. Recall, on the other hand, is the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances in the data.

Therefore, while the provided context gives us a good understanding of how the model's performance is evaluated, it does not directly answer the query regarding the use of accuracy, precision, or recall as metrics.
