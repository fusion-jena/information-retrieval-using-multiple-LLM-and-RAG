Answer:::

Regularization methods are essential techniques in deep learning to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of models and improving their generalization capabilities. Two commonly used regularization methods in deep learning are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization technique introduced by Srivastava et al. (2014) to prevent overfitting in neural networks. During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction of neurons in a layer to zero, effectively creating an ensemble of thinned networks. This process helps to break the co-adaptation of neurons, improving the model's ability to generalize.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a technique that adds a penalty term to the loss function, proportional to the square of the model's weights. This penalty term discourages large weight values, promoting smaller and more uniform weights across the network. Consequently, L2 regularization reduces the complexity of the model and helps prevent overfitting.

In the context of the provided articles, Dehghani et al. (2023) use deep learning approaches, such as LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM, for hourly short-term streamflow forecasting. However, they do not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization in their models. Nevertheless, it is a common practice to apply these regularization techniques when developing deep learning models.

In summary, dropout and L2 regularization are two widely used regularization methods in deep learning to prevent overfitting. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of neurons to zero during training, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function proportional to the square of the model's weights. These techniques help reduce the complexity of models and improve their generalization capabilities.
