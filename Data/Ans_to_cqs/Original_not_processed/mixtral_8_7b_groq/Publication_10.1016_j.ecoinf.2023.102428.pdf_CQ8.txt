Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. There is no mention of GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository in the given text. The study focuses on describing the methodology and results of a specific deep learning application for forest carbon sequestration mapping and economic quantification. However, it does not share the code repository or implementation details that would be necessary to locate or replicate the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
