Answer:::
The specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline for training the EMViT-Net model is AdamW. This information can be inferred from the context provided, which mentions that the model is trained for 100 epochs with optimizer AdamW. The AdamW optimizer is an extension of the Adam optimizer, which includes weight decay regularization. It is widely used in deep learning due to its efficiency and ability to adapt to various problems. Other optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) are not explicitly mentioned in the context.
