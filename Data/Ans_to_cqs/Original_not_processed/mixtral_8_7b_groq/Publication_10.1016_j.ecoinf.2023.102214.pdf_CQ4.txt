Answer:::

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include left-right mirroring, also referred to as "flip augmentation." This technique involves creating a mirrored version of the images in the dataset, which helps to expand the dataset and increase the performance of the deep learning algorithms. The left/right mirroring method used in this study is expected to double the backdrop texture pool used for background matching, allowing the algorithms to better match individuals based on pelt patterns rather than the background. This mirroring technique can be enabled or disabled during PIE (Position-Independent Feature) training, which is a type of deep learning algorithm used in this study.

Other data augmentation techniques such as rotation and scaling are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the snow leopard training pipeline may be repurposed quickly to train new models if more users utilize the system and additional data is submitted. This suggests that other data augmentation techniques may be applied in the pipeline, depending on the specific requirements of the new models being trained.

In summary, the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include left-right mirroring or flip augmentation. This technique helps to expand the dataset and improve the performance of the deep learning algorithms. Other data augmentation techniques such as rotation and scaling may also be applied in the pipeline, depending on the specific requirements of the models being trained.
