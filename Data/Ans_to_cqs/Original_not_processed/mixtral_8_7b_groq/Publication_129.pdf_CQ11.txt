Answer:::
Unfortunately, there is no specific data repository link provided in the given pieces of context regarding the deep learning pipeline for agricultural pests recognition. However, some of the references mention the use of specific datasets for training and testing their models.

For instance, reference [19] introduces a large-scale benchmark dataset for insect pest recognition called IP102, which is available on the IEEE DataPort platform (<https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/ip102-large-scale-benchmark-dataset-insect-pest-recognition>). Similarly, reference [26] uses a dataset of soybean pests detected using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images, but the link to access the dataset is not provided.

Furthermore, reference [25] uses a dataset of X-ray scans for COVID-19 and pneumonia diagnosis, but it is not specific to agricultural pests recognition. The dataset is available on GitHub (<https://github.com/Hemdan-AI/covid-19-pneumonia-datasets>).

Therefore, while there is no direct answer to the query, interested researchers can access some of the related datasets mentioned in the references and build their own deep learning pipelines for agricultural pests recognition.
