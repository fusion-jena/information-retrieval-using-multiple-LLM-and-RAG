Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the specific deep learning model used in the pipeline. The text focuses on the methodology for constructing provincial-scale fitting models for carbon emissions in China based on nighttime imagery, land use data, and statistical energy data. It mentions the use of the STIRPAT model in one study, but it does not specify the type of deep learning model used. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
