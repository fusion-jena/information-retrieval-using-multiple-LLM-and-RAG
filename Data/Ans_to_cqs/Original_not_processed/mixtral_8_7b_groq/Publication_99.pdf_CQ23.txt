Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some details about the data preprocessing and training procedures that can contribute to the model's generalizability.

For the PConv networks, all input images were preprocessed by mean centering the image with ImageNet values and then rescaling between 0 and 1. This preprocessing step can help the model generalize better by reducing the effect of varying image scales and intensities. Additionally, the PConv networks were trained with a learning rate of 0.03, cross-entropy loss as a loss function optimized by the Adam optimizer for 50 epochs. The same learning rate and optimization method were used for the classification networks.

The classification networks were adapted from the pre-trained VGG16 network on the ImageNet dataset. This pre-trained network was fine-tuned for the specific plant species identification task. Fine-tuning pre-trained networks can help improve the generalizability of the model, as the initial layers of the network have already learned features that are common to various images.

For the Pix2Pix network, the models were optimized using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0002. The authors mentioned that they trained all models in a single process while freezing the batch normalization layer in the encoder part. This approach can help the model generalize better by avoiding overfitting due to the small batch size of 1.

In summary, the provided context discusses some data preprocessing techniques and training procedures that can contribute to the generalizability of the deep learning models. However, there is no explicit mention of measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
