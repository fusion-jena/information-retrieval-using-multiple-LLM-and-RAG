Answer:::

 Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a deep learning model. The models mentioned are Bayesian logistic regression, MLE logistic regression, Bayesian GAM (Generalized Additive Model), and random forest. These are all traditional machine learning or statistical models, not deep learning models. Deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), have specific hyperparameters like learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, etc. However, these models are not discussed in the given text. Therefore, I don't have the information to answer this query accurately.
