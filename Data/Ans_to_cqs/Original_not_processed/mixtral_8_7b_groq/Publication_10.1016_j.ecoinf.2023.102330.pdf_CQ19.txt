Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models. However, there are a few papers that use the term "Convolutional Neural Network" (CNN), which is a type of deep learning model.

One paper, "The development of a convolutional neural network for the automatic detection of Northern Bobwhite Colinus virginianus covey calls" by Nolan et al. (2022), mentions using a CNN but does not specify the framework.

Another paper, "BirdNET: a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring" by Kahl et al. (2021), mentions using a deep learning model but does not explicitly state the framework. However, they do mention using a pre-trained model from the TensorFlow library, so it is possible that they used TensorFlow to build their model.

Therefore, based on the limited information provided, it is possible that TensorFlow was used to build at least one of the deep learning models mentioned in the context. However, it is also possible that other frameworks, such as PyTorch, were used, but this information is not provided in the context.
