Answer:::
The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository link. The context discusses the use of various machine learning algorithms, including support vector machines (SVMs), random forests (RFs), decision trees (DTs), and artificial neural networks (ANNs), for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping. However, it does not mention any deep learning models or their code repositories. Therefore, I am unable to provide a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
