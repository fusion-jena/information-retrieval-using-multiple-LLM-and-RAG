Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. However, the text does discuss data preprocessing methods like normalization, principal component analysis, and clustering algorithms.

Data normalization is used to reduce the impact of large differences in dimension and magnitude values of various parameters. This is achieved by scaling the data between a specific range using Eq. (1) in the context.

Furthermore, the text discusses the use of principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering algorithms to select key factors for input data and group datasets with different periodic changes, respectively. These methods help in reducing data dimensionality and information redundancy, thereby improving the predictive performance of DO models.

However, the context does not provide any information about addressing data bias during preprocessing. Data bias can occur due to various reasons such as unequal representation of classes, missing data, or measurement errors. To address these issues, techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and Diverse data collection are commonly used.

Stratified splitting ensures that the train and test datasets have a similar distribution of classes. Oversampling and undersampling techniques are used to balance the class distribution in the dataset. Diverse data collection involves gathering data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population.

Therefore, while the context provides valuable information about data preprocessing methods, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.
