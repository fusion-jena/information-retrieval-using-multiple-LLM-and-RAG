Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the models in Figures 5 and 6 were optimized. Hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization are often used to find the best set of hyperparameters for machine learning models. However, the specific method used in this case is not mentioned in the text.

It is possible that the hyperparameters were optimized using a method that is not specified in the text, or that the optimization process was not included in the scope of the research presented. Without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this question.
