The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline of the "Birdnet" system by Kahl, Wood, Eibl, and Klinck (2021). However, it is common for deep learning models to use optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam during training.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular optimization algorithm for deep learning models. It updates the model's parameters iteratively based on the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter. SGD's simplicity and efficiency make it a go-to optimization technique for many deep learning applications.

Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is another optimization algorithm used in deep learning. Adam combines the advantages of two other optimization methods, AdaGrad and RMSProp, to adaptively adjust learning rates for each parameter. This adaptability allows Adam to effectively handle non-stationary objectives and sparse gradients, making it a suitable choice for various deep learning tasks.

Considering that the "Birdnet" system uses deep learning for avian diversity monitoring, it is highly likely that the authors employed an optimization technique like SGD or Adam during the training process. However, without explicit information in the given context, it is impossible to provide a definitive answer.
