Answer:::

The pieces of context provided discuss the use of a deep learning model for image classification, specifically for distinguishing between different types of birds. However, they do not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model.

However, based on common practice in machine learning and the information provided, it can be inferred that the model's performance is likely evaluated using accuracy, which is the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made. This is mentioned in the context when comparing a model with 99% accuracy that always predicts the majority class versus a model trained to consider all classes.

Additionally, the context discusses the use of a validation dataset, which is an independent set of samples used to compute the accuracy and loss (estimation of the error during training) of the model. This practice is common in machine learning for assessing the learning progress of the model and checking for overfitting.

Moreover, the context also mentions the use of 1,600 images for each zebra finch, except for one that had 1,197 images, for which oversampling was used by creating duplicates of randomly sampled images. This suggests that the class imbalance is a concern, and metrics such as precision and recall could also be used to evaluate the performance of the model. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made, while recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.

In summary, while the pieces of context do not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, it can be inferred that accuracy, precision, and recall are likely used based on common practice in machine learning and the information provided.
