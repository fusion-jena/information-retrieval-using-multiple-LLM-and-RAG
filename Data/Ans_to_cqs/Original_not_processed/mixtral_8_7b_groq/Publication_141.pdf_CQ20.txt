Answer:::

The text provided indicates that the deep learning model was trained using TensorFlow as the back-end engine, which suggests the use of hardware resources such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to accelerate the training process. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of TPUs. Therefore, it can be concluded that GPUs were used for training the deep learning model.
