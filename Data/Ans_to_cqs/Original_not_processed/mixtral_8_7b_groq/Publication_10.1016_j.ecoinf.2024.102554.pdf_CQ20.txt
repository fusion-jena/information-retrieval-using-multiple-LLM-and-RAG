Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context discusses a crawling tool used to retrieve and analyze data from different SRS products, as well as two tables describing in situ data sources and satellite instrument features.

However, it can be inferred that when training deep learning models with large datasets like the ones mentioned in the context (containing vital parameters such as reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), and Chl-a (AOT), Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient concentrations), high-performance hardware resources like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are commonly used to accelerate the training process. These hardware resources can handle the large computational requirements and parallel processing needed for deep learning model training.

In conclusion, while the context does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, it can be reasonably inferred that GPUs or TPUs are used due to the large datasets and computational demands involved in deep learning model training.
