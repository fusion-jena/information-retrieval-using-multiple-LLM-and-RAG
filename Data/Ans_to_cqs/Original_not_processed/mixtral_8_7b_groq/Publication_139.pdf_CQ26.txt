Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the audio data was segmented into 8-second-long clips and downsampled to 16 kHz. Each segment was then converted into log-mel spectrograms using the Librosa python package. This preprocessing step might help to reduce any potential bias in the data, as it increases the likelihood of capturing both biological and anthropogenic sound sources with longer call lengths and represents each segment in a consistent manner.

Furthermore, the authors mentioned that they used a simpler architecture, similar to those implemented by Ruff et al. (2020) and Sprengel et al. (2016), instead of using pre-trained models such as ResNet50 and Inception. This decision might also be a way to reduce data bias, as a simpler architecture may be less prone to overfitting or learning spurious patterns in the data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention specific techniques to address data bias during preprocessing, the described data segmentation, downsampling, and feature extraction methods may help to reduce bias. Additionally, the use of a simpler architecture may also contribute to reducing data bias.
