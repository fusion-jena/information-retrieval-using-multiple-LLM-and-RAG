Answer:::

Based on the provided context, specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that the deep learning models were trained for up to 30 epochs, which refers to the complete training dataset being passed forward and backward across the network one time. Additionally, it is mentioned that the models were selected based on their accuracy as provided by "mcfly," but the specific optimization algorithm used by mcfly is not specified.

In general, there are several optimization techniques that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad. These optimization algorithms are used to minimize the loss function and update the model's parameters during training.

For example, SGD is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model's parameters by taking a step in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. Adam, on the other hand, is an optimization algorithm that adaptively adjusts the learning rate based on the historical gradient information.

Without more information from the provided context, it is not possible to determine which optimization technique was used in this specific deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the deep learning models were trained using a small subset of the training data for 4 epochs, and the best model was selected based on its validation accuracy. This suggests that some form of optimization algorithm was used during the training process, but the specific algorithm is not specified.
