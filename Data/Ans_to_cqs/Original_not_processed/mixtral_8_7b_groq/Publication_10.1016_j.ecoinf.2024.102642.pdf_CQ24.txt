Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the random seed value. However, the text does discuss methods used to manage inter-annotator variability in the context of training deep learning models for cetacean vocalization detection. These strategies may indirectly address some aspects of randomness in the annotation process.

The first approach involves using multi-annotation campaigns, which engage both expert and novice annotators. This method aims to tackle the scarcity of ground truth data in underwater Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) studies. By incorporating annotations from multiple annotators, the model can potentially capture a wider range of vocalization patterns, which may help reduce the impact of individual annotator bias or randomness.

Additionally, two annotation aggregation methods, majority voting and soft labeling, are proposed to optimize the potential of multi-annotation and mitigate the presence of noisy labels. Majority voting selects the most frequent annotation for each sample, while soft labeling creates a probability distribution over the set of annotations. Both methods can improve model performance and reduce variability, especially when a sufficient number of annotators are involved.

While these strategies do not directly address randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they do offer a way to manage variability introduced by human annotators. By using multiple annotators and aggregating their annotations, the model may become more robust to individual annotator bias or randomness. However, further information would be needed to determine if and how randomness in the deep learning pipeline, like random seed value, is explicitly managed in this study.
