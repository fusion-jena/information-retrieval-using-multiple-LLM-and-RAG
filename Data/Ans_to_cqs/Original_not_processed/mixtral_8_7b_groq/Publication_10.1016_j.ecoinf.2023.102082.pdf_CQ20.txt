The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model to create the Lang10m high-resolution CHM of the Earth. It is not explicitly mentioned whether GPUs, TPUs, or any other specific hardware were used in the training process. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
