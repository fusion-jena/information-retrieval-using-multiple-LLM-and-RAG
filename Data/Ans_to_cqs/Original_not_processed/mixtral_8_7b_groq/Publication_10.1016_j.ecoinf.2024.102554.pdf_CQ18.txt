Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context focuses on the description of data sources, features of satellite instruments, and temporal coverage for satellite remote sensing services.

However, it can be inferred that the model performance monitoring might be taking place indirectly through the analysis of the data obtained from various sources. The crawling tool mentioned in the context might be used to gather historical and near real-time data from different satellite remote sensing (SRS) products. The data stored within the NetCDF files, sourced from either ESA or NASA, include vital parameters such as reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), and Chl-a (AOT), Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient concentrations.

It can be assumed that the model performance is being monitored by comparing the model's output with the data obtained from these sources. The comparison can be done by analyzing the vital parameters mentioned above and checking if the model's predictions align well with the actual data. Additionally, the repository's README.md file might contain more information about the model performance monitoring strategy, as it is mentioned to be a valuable resource for those who seek to delve deeper into the operational intricacies of these tools.

In summary, while there is no direct information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, it can be inferred that the model performance monitoring might be taking place indirectly through the analysis of the data obtained from various sources. The comparison of the model's output with the actual data and the use of the repository's README.md file as a valuable resource can provide more insights into the model performance monitoring strategy.
