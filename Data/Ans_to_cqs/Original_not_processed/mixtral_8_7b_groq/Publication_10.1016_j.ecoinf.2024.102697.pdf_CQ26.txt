The provided context discusses the machine learning methodology used in a study, including the use of random forest models, but it does not directly mention techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.

However, I can provide some general information about techniques used to address data bias in machine learning and deep learning:

1. Stratified sampling: This technique is used to ensure that each fold in a cross-validation process contains a representative proportion of samples from each class in imbalanced datasets.
2. Oversampling: In oversampling, the minority class is increased by replicating samples, which can help the model learn more about the minority class. However, this can lead to overfitting.
3. Undersampling: Undersampling involves reducing the majority class to balance the dataset. This can help prevent overfitting, but it may result in loss of important information.
4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources and ensuring diversity in the dataset can help reduce bias.
5. Data augmentation: This technique generates new synthetic samples from the existing data, increasing the dataset size and introducing more variability.
6. Bayesian Optimization: This hyperparameter optimization technique can help minimize bias by searching for the best set of hyperparameters during model development.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, it does mention the use of a repeated nested k-fold cross-validation approach, which can help mitigate bias by ensuring that each fold contains a representative proportion of samples from each class. Additionally, the study mentions the use of Bayesian Optimization for hyperparameter tuning, which can further help reduce bias.
