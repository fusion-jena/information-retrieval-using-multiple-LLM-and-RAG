Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The text focuses on the methodology used for evaluating the effects of landscape fragmentation on ecosystem services, the concept of compact city, and a critical review of multicriteria decision analysis practices in planning of urban green spaces and nature-based solutions.

However, it can be inferred that the authors used statistical methods and tools for data analysis, such as the discovery rate, permeability scoring scale, and raster format conversion. These methods could have been used to monitor the model performance during training, but the text does not provide specific details about it.

Additionally, the reference to the Benjamini and Hochberg (1995) paper on controlling the false discovery rate in multiple testing suggests that the authors may have implemented statistical tests to monitor the model's performance and control for false positives.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly state the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training, it can be inferred that statistical methods and tools were used, and possibly included false discovery rate control.
