Answer:::
I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or any data repository links such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context mainly discusses various machine learning models, including linear regression, Enet, SVM, RF, XGboost, and LightGBM, used for predicting canopy cover from planet data. Therefore, I'm unable to provide the requested link.
