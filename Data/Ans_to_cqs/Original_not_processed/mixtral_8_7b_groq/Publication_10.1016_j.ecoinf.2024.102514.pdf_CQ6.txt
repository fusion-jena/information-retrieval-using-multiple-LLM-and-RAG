Answer:

Based on the provided context, there are two preprocessing steps involved before training a machine learning model, specifically for the water quality index (WQI) prediction approach. These steps are data standardization and data splitting. However, the context does not explicitly mention deep learning models. Nevertheless, these preprocessing steps are also commonly applied to deep learning models.

Data standardization is a crucial step before training any machine learning model, as it optimizes the model error by converting all variables to a uniform scale. In the WQI prediction approach, the study adopted Z-score normalization techniques to standardize the WQ indicator data. The Z-score formula is expressed as Z = (Xi - X) / σ, where Xi is the ith variable of WQ indicator dataset, X refers to the mean value of WQ indicator data, and σ is the standard deviation of WQ indicator data, respectively.

Data splitting is the second preprocessing step, where the WQ indicator data is divided into training and testing datasets. In this study, they adopted 80% and 20% ratios for splitting the training and testing datasets, respectively. A total of 20 and 10 random sample locations were selected for the purposes of training and testing, respectively.

Deep learning models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), also require preprocessing steps before training. These steps include data normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Data normalization is the process of scaling individual features to a range of [0, 1] or (-1, 1) to improve the model's learning and convergence. Data scaling is similar to normalization, but it scales the data to a specific range, such as the mean and standard deviation. Data cleaning is the process of removing or imputing missing or invalid data points to improve the model's accuracy.

Therefore, based on the provided context and general practice in deep learning models, data standardization, data splitting, data normalization, scaling, and cleaning are the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
