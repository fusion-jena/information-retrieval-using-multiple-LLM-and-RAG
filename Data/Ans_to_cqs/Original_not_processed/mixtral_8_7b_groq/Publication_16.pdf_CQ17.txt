Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline described in the given context uses dropout as a regularization method to prevent overfitting. Specifically, a dropout value of 50% has been applied in the first three layers of the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and less prone to overfitting on the training data.

In addition to dropout, the MLP model is configured with a filter size of 2, which can also help to reduce overfitting by limiting the complexity of the model. The model is trained using Backpropagation as the learning algorithm and Adam as the optimizer, both of which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines.

The performance of the trained model is evaluated using Sensitivity, Specificity, Precision, and Accuracy metrics, which are calculated using the test data. The results show that the model achieved a high level of accuracy, with the best performing class achieving a Sensitivity of 0.86 and a Specificity of 0.90.

To further prevent overfitting, the training process is monitored using a loss function calculated for both the test and validation data. Figure 9 shows that there was no overfitting during training, and the dropout layers helped with model regularization. The loss function continues to decrease throughout the specified epochs, indicating that the model is still learning and improving.

Overall, the deep learning pipeline described in the given context uses dropout as the primary regularization method to prevent overfitting. The model is trained using a variety of techniques and evaluated using performance metrics to ensure that it is robust and accurate.
