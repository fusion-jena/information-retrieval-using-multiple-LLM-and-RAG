The hyperparameters of the models are optimized using a three-phase grid search. This information is provided in the initial context statement, which mentions that "the system offers models that are optimized through a three-phase grid search."

However, the specifics of this grid search are not provided in the initial context. Fortunately, additional details are given in the subsequent text, particularly in the section about finding the best model for the biomass estimator. It is stated that grid search employs hyperparameter tuning to find the best regression technique for each step of the process.

Grid search is a systematic method for adjusting and optimizing the hyperparameters of a model. It involves testing the model with different combinations of hyperparameters, systematically and exhaustively, and then selecting the combination that results in the best performance. This approach allows for a thorough exploration of the hyperparameter space and can help to ensure that the model's performance is not limited by suboptimal hyperparameter settings.

In the specific case of the biomass estimator, grid search is used to find the best regression technique for each of the steps in the process. This includes techniques such as Gradient Boosting Regressor, K Neighbors Regressor, Extra Trees Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge. The performance of each of these techniques is evaluated based on metrics such as training time, prediction time, variance, MAE (Mean Absolute Error), R2 (coefficient of determination), and MAE/R2.

In summary, the hyperparameters of the models are optimized using a three-phase grid search, which involves systematically and exhaustively testing the model with different combinations of hyperparameters and selecting the combination that results in the best performance. This approach is used to find the best regression technique for each step of the biomass estimator process.
