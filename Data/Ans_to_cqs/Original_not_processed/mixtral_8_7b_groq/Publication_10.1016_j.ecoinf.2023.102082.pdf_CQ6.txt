Based on the provided context, it is not possible to explicitly list the preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the Sentinel-2 images were used as input for creating the Lang10m CHM at 10 m resolution. This suggests that some image processing steps, such as atmospheric correction, were performed on the Sentinel-2 images before generating the CHM.

Furthermore, the study mentions the use of a deep learning algorithm for fusing GEDI data and Sentinel-2 images. Deep learning algorithms typically require input data to be normalized or scaled to maintain numerical stability during training. However, the context does not provide specific details about the normalization or scaling techniques used.

In summary, while the context does not provide a comprehensive list of preprocessing steps, it can be inferred that image processing and normalization or scaling of input data were part of the preprocessing pipeline before training the deep learning model.
