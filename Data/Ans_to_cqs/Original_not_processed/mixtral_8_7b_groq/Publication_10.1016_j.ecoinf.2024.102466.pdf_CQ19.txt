Answer:::
The article does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning frameworks were used to build the models tested in the study. However, it is very common for deep learning models to be built using either TensorFlow or PyTorch, as these are two of the most popular and widely-used frameworks in the field. Therefore, it is possible that one or both of these frameworks were used in this study. Researchers and developers often choose a framework based on their specific needs, such as the type of model they are building, the hardware they have available, and their personal familiarity with the framework. Without more specific information from the article, it is not possible to give a definitive answer to this question.
