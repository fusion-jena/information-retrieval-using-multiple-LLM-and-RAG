Answer:::

The specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context is the RMSprop stochastic descent optimizer. This information can be inferred from the statement that says, "We chose the RMSprop stochastic descent optimizer with the default parameters."

The RMSprop optimizer is a type of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization method that uses running averages of squared gradient estimates to scale the learning rate. It was developed to overcome some of the challenges faced by traditional SGD methods, such as the need to manually tune the learning rate and the difficulty in handling non-stationary objectives.

The RMSprop optimizer is a popular choice for training deep neural networks because it can adapt to the local learning rate of each parameter, allowing for faster and more stable convergence. However, it's worth noting that other optimization techniques, such as Adam or Adagrad, could also have been used in this deep learning pipeline.
