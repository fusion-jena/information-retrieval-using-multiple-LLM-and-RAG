Answer:::
The specific type of deep learning model used in the described study is not explicitly mentioned as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer. However, it is mentioned that an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, particularly the NARX model, is used. ANN is a type of traditional neural network and not considered a deep learning model. However, the study does incorporate wavelet analysis, which is a mathematical tool used for signal processing, including deep learning applications. The wavelet analysis is combined with the NARX ANN model to create a hybrid model, aiming to enhance the performance of the NARX ANN model. Therefore, while the study does not explicitly use a CNN, RNN, or Transformer, it does utilize a deep learning-related approach by combining a traditional ANN with wavelet analysis.
