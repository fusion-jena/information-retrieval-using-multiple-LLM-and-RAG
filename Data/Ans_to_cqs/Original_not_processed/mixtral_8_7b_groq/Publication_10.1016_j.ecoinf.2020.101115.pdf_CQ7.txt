Answer:::

The provided context does not include specific information on criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. However, it does discuss the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) which are used to guide the creation and management of scientific data.

In the context of deep learning, data splitting is an important step in the model building process. The data is typically divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

The criteria used to split the data can vary depending on the specific use case and the nature of the data. Common methods include:

* Random sampling: where the data is randomly divided into the three subsets.
* Stratified sampling: where the data is divided such that each subset has the same proportion of samples from each class.
* Time-series sampling: where the data is divided based on time, such as using the first X% of the data for training, the next Y% for validation, and the remaining Z% for testing.

It is important to note that the chosen method for splitting the data can have a significant impact on the model's performance and generalizability.

In summary, while the provided context does not include specific information on data splitting for deep learning, it does discuss the FAIR data principles which are used to guide the management of scientific data. The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training can vary, and common methods include random sampling, stratified sampling, and time-series sampling.
