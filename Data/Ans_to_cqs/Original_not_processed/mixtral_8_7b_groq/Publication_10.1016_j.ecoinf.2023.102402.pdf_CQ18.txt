Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of two evaluation metrics: the Area Under the receiver-operator Curve (AUC) and the True Skill Statistics (TSS). These methods are commonly used in species distribution model studies to assess model performance.

The AUC provides a value ranging from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating a higher accuracy of model prediction. It measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve (a plot of true positive rate vs false positive rate) and provides an overall measure of model performance.

On the other hand, the TSS calculates the difference between the skill score (the proportion of true skill) and the chance score (the proportion of random skill). TSS values range between -1 and +1, where a value of +1 means complete agreement between observed and predicted distributions, and values of ≤0 denote no better than random performance.

These metrics were used to evaluate the model's performance in predicting the presence of a particular species. The model's performance was categorized into four classes: very poor (AUC or TSS < 0.335), poor (0.336 ≤ AUC or TSS ≤ 0.665), medium (0.666 ≤ AUC or TSS ≤ 0.999), and good (AUC or TSS = 1).

In addition to these metrics, the training process also involved the use of presence data collected through a questionnaire that included details on sighting sites, habitat features, and the number of encountered specimens. Percentages on the total number of responses were computed for each of these values.

Overall, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involved the use of two evaluation metrics (AUC and TSS) and the analysis of presence data collected through a questionnaire. This approach ensured the best performance and robust results of Maxent models.
