The pieces of context provided do not directly mention the "deep learning pipeline" or the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this context. However, they do mention the use of sensors in the context of plant physiology and agriculture.

In the context of the Cortazar et al. (2015) study, Google Glass was used as a sensor to quantify plant chlorophyll content. This suggests that sensors can be used to collect raw data in the context of plant physiology and agriculture.

In the context of the Dom√≠nguez et al. (2016) study, remote sensing methods were used to predict the growth of winter oilseed rape and winter wheat. Remote sensing typically involves the use of sensors mounted on satellites, aircraft, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data about the Earth's surface.

In the context of the Evans (1983) and Filella et al. (1995) studies, reflectance indices were used to evaluate wheat nitrogen status. Reflectance indices can be measured using sensors that detect the amount of light reflected by plants.

In the context of the Osroosh et al. (2018) study, a thermal-RGB imaging system was developed for monitoring agricultural crops. This system likely involves the use of sensors to collect data about the temperature and color of crops.

Therefore, it can be inferred that sensors are commonly used for collecting raw data in the context of plant physiology and agriculture. These sensors may include devices like Google Glass, remote sensing instruments, reflectance indices sensors, and thermal-RGB imaging systems.

It is also possible that other methods, such as surveys or public datasets, could be used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for plant physiology and agriculture. However, the provided pieces of context do not mention these methods in the specific context of plant physiology and agriculture.
