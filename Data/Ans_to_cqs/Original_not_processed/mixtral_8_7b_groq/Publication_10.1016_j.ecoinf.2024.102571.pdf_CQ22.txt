The provided context does not include specific information about the evaluation metrics used for the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model's performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R-squared) in the context of predicting GHGdwts (Greenhouse Gas emissions per unit of Gross Domestic Product).

The R-squared value is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. The R-squared value ranges from 0 to 1. A value closer to 1 indicates a better fit of the model to the data, implying that the independent variables (population size and GDP) can explain a higher proportion of the variance in the dependent variable (GHGdwts).

However, the context does not mention other common evaluation metrics for deep learning models, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or Area Under the Curve (AUC). These metrics are often used to assess the performance of deep learning models, particularly in classification tasks.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, the deep learning model's performance was evaluated using the R-squared metric for predicting GHGdwts. Other common evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC, were not mentioned in the context.
