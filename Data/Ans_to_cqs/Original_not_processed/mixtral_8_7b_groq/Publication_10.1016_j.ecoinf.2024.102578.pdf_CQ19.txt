Answer:::
The deep learning models for Finnmark and Yamal were built using the keras package in R with a TensorFlow backend. This information is provided in the first sentence of the context, which states that "Separate two-class models were trained for Finnmark and Yamal using the keras package in R (Allaire and Chollet, 2023) with a TensorFlow backend (Allaire and Tang, 2023)." Therefore, TensorFlow is one of the frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The specific architecture used for the models is ResNet-50, a convolutional neural network that is 50 layers deep. This information is provided in the fourth sentence of the context. It is not explicitly stated in the context whether any other frameworks were used to build the deep learning model, so I cannot confirm whether any other frameworks were used. However, based on the information provided, it is clear that TensorFlow is one of the frameworks used.
