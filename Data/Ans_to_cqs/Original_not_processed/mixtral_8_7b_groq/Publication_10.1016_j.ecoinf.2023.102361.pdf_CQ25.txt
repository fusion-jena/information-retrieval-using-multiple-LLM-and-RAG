Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning models in the context provided is image classification. This is evident in several parts of the text. Firstly, in section 2.3, the deep learning models mentioned are VGG16, VGG19, ResNet-50, Inception-V3, InceptionRes-NetV2, Xception, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201, and MobileNetV2. These models are known for their use in image classification tasks. 

Secondly, in section 2.7, it is stated that the deep learning models were developed using Python 3.8 and Tensorflow 2.4 library, and were initialised with the pre-trained weights trained on the ImageNet dataset. The ImageNet dataset is a large-scale image recognition dataset, often used for training image classification models. 

Finally, in section 2.2, it is mentioned that the datasets were divided into three parts for training, validation, and testing. This is a common practice in machine learning and deep learning for training classification models. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning models is image classification.
