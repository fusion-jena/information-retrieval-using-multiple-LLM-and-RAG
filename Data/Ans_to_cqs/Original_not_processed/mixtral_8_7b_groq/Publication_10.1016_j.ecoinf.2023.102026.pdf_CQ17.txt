The provided context discusses machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on random forests (RF) and their advantages over Classification and Regression Trees (CART). It also mentions the importance of resampling techniques, such as bootstrapping, in improving model precision. However, the context does not directly mention regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout and L2 regularization.

Regularization methods are essential in deep learning to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Two common regularization techniques are L2 regularization and dropout.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function, proportional to the sum of the squares of the model's weights. This penalty discourages large weight values, promoting simpler models that generalize better to unseen data.

Dropout is a regularization technique specifically designed for neural networks. During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction of neuron outputs to zero, preventing the network from relying too much on any single neuron. This leads to a robust ensemble of models, improving the model's ability to generalize.

While the provided context does not discuss these regularization techniques directly, it does touch upon the general idea of preventing overfitting. RF overcomes limitations of CART, such as overfitting, by combining multiple CART models. This ensemble approach reduces the variance of the individual trees, leading to better generalization. However, the context does not specifically mention dropout or L2 regularization.
