Answer:

The data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context is image data. The study focuses on bacterial image recognition in environmental samples. The sampling locations exhibit noticeable differences in bacterial abundance and morphology, which are utilized to assess the efficacy of a deep learning recognition model. The model is trained with a dataset that includes image augmentations such as flip, rotation, and affine transformation. The authors suggest that image annotation can provide satisfactory information on bacterial populations within the chips. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline in this study primarily works with image data.
