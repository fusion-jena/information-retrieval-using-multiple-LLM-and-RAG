Answer:::

Based on the information provided, there is no specific mention of the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model for water quality parameter (WQP) inversion. However, it is stated that the limited number of samples was not conducive to deep learning. Therefore, I will provide a general answer regarding the preprocessing steps typically involved in deep learning model training.

Deep learning models often require preprocessing steps to ensure the input data is suitable for the model's learning process. These steps may include:

1. Data cleaning: This involves removing or correcting erroneous, missing, or inconsistent data points to ensure the dataset's integrity.

2. Normalization or Scaling: Deep learning models, especially neural networks, are sensitive to the scale of input features. Therefore, it is essential to normalize or scale the data to a common range, such as [0, 1] or using standardization (mean = 0, variance = 1). This ensures that all features contribute equally to the learning process.

3. Feature engineering: Depending on the dataset, feature engineering may be required to extract meaningful features from the raw data. This process may include dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), or feature extraction methods, such as Fourier or Wavelet transforms.

4. Data splitting: The dataset is typically split into training, validation, and testing sets. This allows for the evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data and helps prevent overfitting.

In the context of WQP inversion, the preprocessing steps might include data cleaning to remove outliers or missing values, normalization or scaling to ensure consistent input feature scales, and feature engineering to extract relevant features from the raw data. However, the specific preprocessing steps would depend on the dataset and the deep learning model used.
