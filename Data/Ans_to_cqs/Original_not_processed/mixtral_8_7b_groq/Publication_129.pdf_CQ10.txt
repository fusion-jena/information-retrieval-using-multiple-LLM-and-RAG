Answer:::

I regret to inform you that there is no code repository link provided in the given context for the deep learning pipeline used in the study titled "A new mobile application of agricultural pests recognition using deep learning in cloud computing system". The paper, published in the Alexandria Engineering Journal in 2021, discusses the implementation of a mobile application for agricultural pest recognition using deep learning and cloud computing. However, it does not provide a link to the code repository used in the study. Therefore, I am unable to fulfill this query.
