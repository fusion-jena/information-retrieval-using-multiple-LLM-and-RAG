Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that deep learning has been widely employed to detect and count wildlife in aerial imagery, and that various practices have been used to address a substantially imbalanced dataset.

In the context of image processing and computer vision, data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used to increase the size of the training dataset, improve model performance, and reduce overfitting. Flipping involves horizontally or vertically flipping the images, while rotating involves rotating the images by a certain angle. Scaling involves changing the size of the images.

For instance, in the study by Lamprey et al. (2020a), cameras were used to replace human observers in multi-species aerial counts in Murchison Falls, Uganda. The study used deep learning models to detect and count wildlife in the aerial imagery. Although the specific data augmentation techniques used in the study are not mentioned, it is likely that data augmentation was employed to increase the size of the training dataset and improve model performance.

Similarly, in the study by Delplanque et al. (2023b), deep learning was used to automate the processing of images from SRF-OCC surveys. The study did not mention specific data augmentation techniques, but it is possible that data augmentation was used to increase the size of the training dataset and improve model performance.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give specific details about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling were employed to increase the size of the training dataset, improve model performance, and reduce overfitting.
