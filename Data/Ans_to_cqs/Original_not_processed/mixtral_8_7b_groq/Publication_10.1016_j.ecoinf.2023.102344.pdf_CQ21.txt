Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of evaluation metrics and the generation of confusion matrices.

After training the models using Approaches 1 to 3, the performance of each model was evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, fall-out, precision, specificity, recall, and F1-score. These metrics were calculated to assess the effectiveness of the models in traceability tasks for bivalves.

Furthermore, confusion matrices were generated for the optimized pre-trained network with numerical inputs through EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3. A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model on a set of data for which the true values are known. It allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm and can be used to determine the areas where the model is performing well and where it is not.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps in the provided context. Saliency maps are a way of visualizing the importance of different input features to the output of a convolutional neural network. They are generated by computing the gradient of the output with respect to the input and highlighting the regions of the input that have the greatest influence on the output.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of evaluation metrics and the generation of confusion matrices.
