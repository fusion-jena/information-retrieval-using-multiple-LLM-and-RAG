Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses a SEM (Structural Equation Modeling) analysis of drivers of per capita CEFs (Crop Evapotranspiration Fraction), but it does not mention any specific methods used for hyperparameter optimization such as grid search, random search, or others.

The context provides details on the SEM fitness indices, path coefficients, and significance of HCPA per capita CEF drivers. It also includes information on variable selection, which references several studies, but none of these studies discuss the optimization of hyperparameters.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query about the optimization of hyperparameters.
