Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the deep learning frameworks used in Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020) for their study on species distribution modeling. The authors discussed the impact of sample size and network depth on the performance of deep learning models, but they did not mention any deep learning frameworks or libraries.

Deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and others provide tools and libraries for designing, training, and deploying deep learning models. However, the specific framework used in Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020) remains unspecified in the context.

In the context, the authors used the Rainforest Connection's Automated Remote Biodiversity Monitoring Network (ARBIMON) platform, which includes a random forest model for species identification based on audio recordings. However, a random forest model is a machine learning algorithm based on decision trees and not a deep learning model. Therefore, the context does not provide information about deep learning frameworks.

Answer:::
The provided context does not contain information on the deep learning frameworks used in Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020) for their study on species distribution modeling.
