Answer:::
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context mainly discusses the advantages of using deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification. It also mentions some limitations encountered when using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) for classification. However, it does not specify any data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
