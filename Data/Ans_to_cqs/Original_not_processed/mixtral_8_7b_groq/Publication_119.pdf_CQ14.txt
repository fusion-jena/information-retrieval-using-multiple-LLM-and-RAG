Answer:::

The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using GridSearchCV, which is a part of the scikit-learn 0.24 module. GridSearchCV is an exhaustive search method that tries all possible combinations of the specified parameter values and selects the best set of hyperparameters that result in the highest testing accuracy and kappa value.

In the context provided, GridSearchCV is used to optimize the hyperparameters of three different models, namely, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, and a Random Forest (RF) model.

For the DNN model, the learning rate and batch size are optimized using GridSearchCV. The optimized hyperparameter values for learning rate and batch size are found to be 0.007 and 48, respectively.

For the SVM model with an RBF kernel, the C and γ parameters are optimized using GridSearchCV. The best values for C and γ are found to be 1000 and 1, respectively. The C parameter in the SVM model involves a trade-off between correct classification and maximization of the margin. Thus, a smaller C value will result in a wider margin and thus a lower accuracy. The γ value controls the radius of influence of the training samples. Thus, a greater value will result in a model that overfits on the training data and poor generalization on the testing data.

For the RF model, the number of trees and the maximum number of features to be considered for the best split are optimized using GridSearchCV. The best number of trees is found to be 130, and the maximum features required for split is found to be 'auto.'

Therefore, it can be concluded that GridSearchCV is used to optimize the hyperparameters of the models in the context provided.
