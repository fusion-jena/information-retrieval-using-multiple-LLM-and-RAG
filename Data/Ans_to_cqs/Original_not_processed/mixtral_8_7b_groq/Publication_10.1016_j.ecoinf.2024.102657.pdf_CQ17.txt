Answer:::
Based on the provided context, no specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization are mentioned as having been used in the deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting. The goal of the pipeline was to demonstrate the power of human-machine teaming with the least amount of preprocessing possible. When assessing the accuracy of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on noise-filtered data versus raw data, the accuracy levels were similar, suggesting that overfitting may not have been a significant issue. Additionally, the training, validation, and testing sets were created by taking different percentages of the full dataset, which can help reduce variability and overfitting. However, the specific regularization methods used are not mentioned in the provided context.
