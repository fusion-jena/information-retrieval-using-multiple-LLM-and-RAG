Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository link, such as a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket link. The context discusses an algorithm for associating information on stocks, species variety, and threatening status to the fishing hours of each cell in a studied area. It also explains how fishing pressure per stock is calculated and the data sources used, including the Copernicus marine environment monitoring service, Ocean Biodiversity Information System, Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Information System of FAO, and global numbers of threatened species. However, it does not mention any deep learning pipeline or its code repository.
