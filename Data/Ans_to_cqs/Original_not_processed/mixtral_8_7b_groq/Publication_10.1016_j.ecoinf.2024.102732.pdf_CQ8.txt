After reviewing the provided context, I was unable to locate information regarding a code repository for a deep learning pipeline. The context includes several studies and articles related to machine learning, remote sensing, and forest ecosystem services, but none of them mention a deep learning pipeline or its code repository.

There are studies that discuss the use of machine learning methods, such as random forests, for predicting aboveground biomass in the Himalayas (Hengl et al., 2017) and modeling forest above-ground biomass using satellite and multisource datasets (Hojo et al., 2023). However, these studies do not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository.

Furthermore, some of the studies discuss the application of machine learning algorithms to field data and remote sensing data, but they do not mention a deep learning pipeline or its code repository (Chen et al., 2023a; Chen et al., 2023b).

Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot provide an answer to the query regarding the code repository of the deep learning pipeline.
