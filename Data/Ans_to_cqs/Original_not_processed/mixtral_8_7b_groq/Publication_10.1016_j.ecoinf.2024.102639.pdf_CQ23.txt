The provided context discusses the methodology and procedures used for building a decision-making model, including the application of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and traditional models. However, it does not directly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot specifically answer the query regarding the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

Nonetheless, I can provide some general measures commonly used to enhance the generalizability of deep learning models:

1. Diverse dataset: Training a deep learning model on a diverse dataset, which includes various data sources, distributions, and scenarios, can help improve its generalizability. A diverse dataset can expose the model to a wide range of patterns and variations, enabling it to learn more robust representations.

2. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance and generalizability of machine learning models, including deep learning models. It involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on different subsets, and evaluating its performance on the remaining portions. This process helps to identify overfitting and adjust the model's complexity accordingly.

3. Stratified splitting: Stratified splitting is a method used for dividing a dataset into training, validation, and testing sets while preserving the original dataset's class distribution. This technique can help ensure that the model is exposed to a balanced representation of classes during training, reducing the risk of biased predictions.

4. Regularization techniques: Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping, can help prevent overfitting and improve the generalizability of deep learning models. These techniques limit the model's complexity by adding constraints or penalties to the loss function or by randomly dropping neurons during training.

5. Data augmentation: Data augmentation is a technique that involves artificially increasing the size of the dataset by applying transformations, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping, to the existing data. This method can help the model learn more robust features and improve its generalizability.

Although the provided context does not discuss these specific measures for deep learning models, they are common practices in machine learning and can contribute to the generalizability of deep learning models.
