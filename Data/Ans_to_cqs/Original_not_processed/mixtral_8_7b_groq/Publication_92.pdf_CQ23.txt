Answer:::
The text provided does not give explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some implicit indications that suggest the use of a diverse dataset and cross-validation.

Firstly, the model is trained on a database consisting of image-label couples, where the label is the fish species. This implies that the dataset is diverse, containing different types of fish images. A diverse dataset is crucial for the model to learn a wide range of features and improve its ability to generalize.

Secondly, the model follows the GoogLeNet architecture with 27 layers, 9 inception layers, and a soft-max classifier. GoogLeNet won the 2014 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) with a significant margin, indicating its strong generalization ability. The inception layers in GoogLeNet allow for efficient use of computational resources and improve the model's performance by reducing dimensionality.

Thirdly, the model uses a sliding window approach for fish detection, where a motion score is computed for each sliding window. This suggests the use of cross-validation, as the motion score could be used as a metric for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data.

Lastly, the text mentions several papers and resources related to deep learning and neural networks, indicating that the authors have followed best practices and guidelines in developing the model.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention measures such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, there are implicit indications that suggest the use of a diverse dataset and cross-validation to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
