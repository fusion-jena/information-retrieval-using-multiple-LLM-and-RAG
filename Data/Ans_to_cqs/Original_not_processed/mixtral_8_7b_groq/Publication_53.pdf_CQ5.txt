Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific dataset used for training the deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. However, it does mention that the model was initially pre-trained using ImageNet and then fine-tuned using a custom dataset of 7362 labeled images of dams and non-dams. These images were taken from a compiled database and further validated using a subsample of approximately 2000 dams in each state and territory of Australia. Therefore, while the specific dataset used for initial training is known (ImageNet), the custom dataset used for fine-tuning the model is not explicitly named.
