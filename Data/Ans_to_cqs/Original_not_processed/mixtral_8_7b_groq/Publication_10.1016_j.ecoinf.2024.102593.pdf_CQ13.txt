Answer:::

The provided context discusses various aspects of deep learning models, including their architecture, training, and evaluation. However, it does not explicitly enumerate the hyperparameters used in the models. Hyperparameters are configuration variables that are set before the learning process begins and that determine the structure of the model or the learning algorithm. Examples of hyperparameters include the learning rate, the choice of optimization algorithm, the number of layers in the model, and the number of units in each layer.

The context does mention some specific models, such as SincNet, BirdNET, and various types of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We can look up the documentation or source code for these models to find out more about their hyperparameters.

For example, the SincNet model is a type of CNN that is designed for audio signal processing tasks, such as speech recognition and bird species classification. According to the documentation for the SincNet implementation in the SpeechBrain toolkit, the hyperparameters for this model include:

* Learning rate: a scalar value that determines the step size for each update to the model weights.
* Optimizer: an algorithm that updates the model weights based on the gradients of the loss function. The SincNet implementation supports several optimizers, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.
* Number of layers: the number of convolutional and pooling layers in the model.
* Number of filters: the number of filters in each convolutional layer.
* Filter length: the length of each filter in samples.
* Sampling rate: the sampling rate of the input audio signal.
* Batch size: the number of input samples in each batch.
* Number of epochs: the number of times the model is trained on the entire dataset.

Similarly, the BirdNET model is a type of CNN that is designed for bird species classification from audio recordings. The BirdNET documentation does not provide a comprehensive list of hyperparameters, but it does mention some of the key parameters, such as:

* Number of layers: the number of convolutional and pooling layers in the model.
* Number of filters: the number of filters in each convolutional layer.
* Filter length: the length of each filter in samples.
* Input window size: the length of the input audio window in seconds.
* Hop size: the time step between adjacent input windows.
* Number of output classes: the number of bird species that the model can recognize.

The context also mentions the use of t-SNE for dimensionality reduction of embeddings. t-SNE is a technique for visualizing high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional space, such as a 2D or 3D plot. It is not a hyperparameter of the deep learning model, but rather a tool for analyzing the output of the model.

In summary, the provided context does not give a complete list of the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models. However, we can consult the documentation or source code for the specific models to find out more about their hyperparameters. Examples of hyperparameters for deep learning models include the learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of filters, filter length, input window size, hop size, and number of output classes.
