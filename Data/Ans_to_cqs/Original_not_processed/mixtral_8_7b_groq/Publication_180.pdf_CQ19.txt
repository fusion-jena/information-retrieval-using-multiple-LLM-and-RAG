Answer:::

The deep learning model for automated species identification of triatomine species responsible for Chagas disease was built using TensorFlow. TensorFlow is an open-source software platform for deep learning research and applications, initially released by Google's Brain Team. In this project, TensorFlow was adapted and configured for application and use in the identification system via Python.

The researchers using TensorFlow made adjustments to two parameters from their default values. First, the validation percentage was increased from 10% to 16% due to the small number of images available for some species. Second, the number of training steps was explored and compared to find the optimum balance between computing time and classification efficiency. The default value for training steps was 4000, but the project required an adjustment to this value.

TensorFlow offered a crucial advantage in eliminating the need for preprocessing images for the identification system. The researchers compared TensorFlow's classification performance based on cleaned and raw images for the Mexican species, which were the most challenging to their statistical classifiers.

In summary, the deep learning model for automated species identification of triatomine species was constructed using TensorFlow, an open-source software platform for deep learning research and applications. TensorFlow was chosen for its ability to eliminate the need for image preprocessing and its successful classification performance based on cleaned and raw images of the Mexican triatomine species.
