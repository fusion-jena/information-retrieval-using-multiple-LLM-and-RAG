Answer:::

The primary dataset used in the deep learning pipeline discussed in the text is the FishInTurbidWater dataset. This dataset was quickly and weakly labeled to create a weakly-supervised fish dataset for turbid waters. The dataset was then used to develop two novel deep learning networks.

In addition to the FishInTurbidWater dataset, the authors used the open-source fully-labeled ImageNet dataset. ImageNet was used for transfer learning, where two well-known DNNs, EfficientNet and ViT, were pre-trained. ImageNet is a large visual dataset consisting of fourteen million images, hand-annotated with bounding boxes to indicate objects present in the images.

The MNIST and CIFAR datasets are not explicitly mentioned in the text. However, the authors use the term "well-known DNNs," which may include models trained on these datasets.

In summary, the FishInTurbidWater and ImageNet datasets were used in the deep learning pipeline discussed in the text. The ImageNet dataset was used for transfer learning, while the FishInTurbidWater dataset was used for developing deep learning networks for fish detection in turbid waters. The MNIST and CIFAR datasets are not explicitly mentioned but may have been used for pre-training some of the DNNs.
