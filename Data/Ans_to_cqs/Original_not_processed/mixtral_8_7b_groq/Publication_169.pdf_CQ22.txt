The performance of the deep learning model was evaluated using the accuracy metric. The accuracy obtained reaches 95% on 140 epochs. This is evident in the context where it is stated that "The accuracy obtained reaches 95% on 140 epochs." Although other metrics such as precision and recall are commonly used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models, the context does not provide information on these metrics in relation to the model being evaluated.

It's worth noting that the proposed model was compared with state-of-the-art approaches to justify its performance. However, the specific metrics used for this comparison are not provided in the context. Nonetheless, the fact that the proposed model outperforms the conventional CNN in terms of accuracy (95.06% vs 91%) is a significant finding.

In summary, the performance of the deep learning model was evaluated using the accuracy metric, and the model achieved an accuracy of 95% on 140 epochs. Other metrics such as precision and recall were not mentioned in the context in relation to the model's performance evaluation.
