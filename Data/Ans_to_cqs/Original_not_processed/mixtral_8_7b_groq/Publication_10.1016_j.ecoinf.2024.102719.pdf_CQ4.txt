Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. However, data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning to increase the amount of training data, improve model performance, and reduce overfitting. Some common data augmentation techniques for images include flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping.

Flipping: This technique involves flipping the image horizontally or vertically, which can help the model generalize better and be more robust to variations in image orientation.

Rotating: Rotating the image by a certain angle can help the model learn to recognize objects regardless of their orientation.

Scaling: Scaling or zooming the image can help the model learn to recognize objects at different scales.

Cropping: Cropping the image can help the model focus on the important parts of the image and ignore irrelevant background information.

These techniques can be applied on-the-fly during training, meaning that the model never sees the same image twice. This can help the model learn to recognize patterns in the data even when the input is slightly different, which can improve its performance on new, unseen data.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping are common techniques that can be used to augment data and improve model performance.
