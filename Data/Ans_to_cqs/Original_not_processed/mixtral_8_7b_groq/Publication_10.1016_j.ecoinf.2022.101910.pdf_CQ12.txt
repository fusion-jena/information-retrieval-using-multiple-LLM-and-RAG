Answer:::

The specific type of deep learning model used in the BirdNET pipeline is a deep neural network. However, the context does not provide enough information to determine if it is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or another type of deep learning architecture. Given that BirdNET is designed for sound recognition, particularly bird vocalizations, it is possible that CNNs or other temporal convolutional networks are used to extract features from the audio data. These models are commonly used in audio signal processing and have been successful in other sound recognition tasks. Nonetheless, the exact deep learning model employed in BirdNET remains undisclosed in the given context.
