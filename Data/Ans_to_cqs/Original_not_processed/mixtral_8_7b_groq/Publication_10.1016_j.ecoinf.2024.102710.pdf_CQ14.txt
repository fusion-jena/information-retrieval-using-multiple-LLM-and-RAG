Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text mentions the use of BirdNet-1 as the embedding model for active learning experiments, and it discusses various sampling strategies for active learning, but it does not mention any methods for hyperparameter optimization such as grid search or random search.

The text does mention that classifier heads used in the active learning process are identical to those from the transfer learning training process, but it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the transfer learning model were optimized.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
