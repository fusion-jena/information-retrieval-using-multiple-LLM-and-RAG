Answer:::
The text does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model in terms of diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was applied to Landsat images, which suggests that the dataset may have been diverse in terms of spatial and temporal coverage.

In addition, the study by Girardin et al. (2016) mentioned in the context used seasonal trends of Amazonian rainforest phenology, net primary productivity, and carbon allocation, which could imply that the model was trained on data with temporal variation.

Furthermore, the study by Couttenier et al. (2022) used a large-scale dataset of artisanal and small-scale mines, which may have helped to improve the generalizability of the model.

The study by Dethier et al. (2023) also analyzed a global rise in alluvial mining, which could have provided a diverse dataset for the model.

However, without explicit information about the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting, it is difficult to determine the extent to which these techniques were used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.

In summary, while the text does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the use of diverse datasets and large-scale analysis suggests that some steps may have been taken to improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.
