Answer:::

The text provided gives some insight into the steps taken to ensure the performance and generalizability of the deep learning model, although it does not explicitly mention techniques such as diverse dataset creation, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

To avoid overfitting and enhance the model's ability to generalize, the authors employed a validation set to select the best model during the training stage. This method helps in assessing the model's performance on unseen data and aids in preventing overfitting to the training set.

Furthermore, the authors used a two-step training procedure for the pre-trained model's fine-tuning. The first step involved training the architecture using positive patches for 200 epochs, while the second step collected and included hard negative patches (patches containing false positives) to further train the model for 50 epochs. This process aimed to reduce the number of false positives and improve the model's ability to distinguish between actual and false detections.

During inference, the patch size was set to 1024 Ã— 1,024 pixels to accelerate the process. Although not explicitly stated, this approach might have contributed to the model's generalizability by ensuring consistent processing and analysis of data across different scenarios.

Lastly, the iterative fine-tuning process for 4 iterations using the entire SW stratum aimed to enhance the model's performance and gather samples pertaining to each key species present in the region. This strategy might have helped the model learn a more diverse set of features, contributing to its generalizability.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention diverse dataset creation, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, it does describe measures taken to prevent overfitting, reduce false positives, and learn diverse features, which collectively contribute to the model's generalizability.
