Answer:::
I was unable to find a specific link to a data repository for a deep learning pipeline in the provided context. However, there are a few mentions of data availability and repositories. It is stated that partial data is available on Figshare and Github. Additionally, there is a reference to a survey on image data augmentation for deep learning, which may be related to a deep learning pipeline, but the data repository for this study is not provided in the context. Therefore, while there are some indications of data availability and repositories, a specific link to a data repository for a deep learning pipeline is not provided in the context.
