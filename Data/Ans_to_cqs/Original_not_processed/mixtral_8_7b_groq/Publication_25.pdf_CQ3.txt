Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the annotation process involves labeling trees in the data collected from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) site at the San Joaquin Experimental Range in California.

The pipeline consists of two main steps: first, an unsupervised detection of trees is performed using Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data. This initial training data is then combined with a small number of hand-annotated trees in a semi-supervised framework to create the final model.

While the specific annotation technique is not mentioned, it can be inferred that the hand-annotated trees likely involve some form of labeling or marking the trees to distinguish them from other objects in the data. This could range from simple point annotations indicating the location of tree trunks to more complex annotations such as bounding boxes or instance segmentation masks.

The context also mentions the use of self-supervised learning, which relies on unsupervised methods to generate training data. In this case, unsupervised tree detection is performed using LIDAR data. However, it is unclear whether this step involves any form of annotation or labeling.

Overall, while the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that some form of labeling or marking of trees is involved in the hand-annotated data.
