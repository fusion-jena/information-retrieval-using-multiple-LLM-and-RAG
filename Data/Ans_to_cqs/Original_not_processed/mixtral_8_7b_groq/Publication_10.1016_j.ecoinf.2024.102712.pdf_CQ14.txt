Based on the provided context, there is not enough information to explicitly answer how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized in the studies. However, it can be inferred that some studies might have used methods such as grid search or random search to optimize the hyperparameters of their models, while others may not have explicitly mentioned the optimization method used.

For instance, Behera et al. (2016) used QuadPOL ALOS PALSAR data to estimate above-ground biomass and carbon of Shorea robusta and Tectona grandis forests. They developed a linear regression model using spectral bands as explanatory variables. However, they did not mention any specific method for hyperparameter optimization.

Bhattacharjee et al. (2019) used a Terrestrial Laser Scanner for tree parameters retrieval and volume estimation in a case study on Barkot Forest. They developed a regression model using tree parameters as explanatory variables, but they did not mention any specific method for hyperparameter optimization.

Bijalwan et al. (2010) used satellite remote sensing and GIS for land-use, biomass, and carbon estimation in dry tropical forest of Chhattisgarh region in India. They developed a regression model using spectral bands as explanatory variables, but they did not mention any specific method for hyperparameter optimization.

Chave et al. (2005) developed a tree allometry model for improved estimation of carbon stocks and balance in tropical forests. They used a combination of different explanatory variables, including tree diameter, height, and wood density. However, they did not mention any specific method for hyperparameter optimization.

Saarela et al. (2016, 2018) used hierarchical modeling for forest biomass estimation. They used a combination of different explanatory variables, including tree diameter, height, and wood density. They might have used methods such as grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization, but they did not explicitly mention it in their studies.

Therefore, it can be concluded that while some studies might have used methods such as grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization, others may not have explicitly mentioned the optimization method used. Further information is required to provide a definitive answer.
