Answer:::

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include the rate of correct classification, mean time needed for identification, and comparison with human performance. The rate of correct classification, which is equivalent to accuracy, is the percentage of fish thumbnails that the model classified correctly. For the best model, this rate was 94.9% with a standard deviation of 3.3%. The mean time needed for identification by humans was 5 seconds. The model's performance was also compared to that of humans in identifying fish thumbnails. On average, each human identified 270 fish thumbnails with a mean correct classification rate of 89.3% and a standard deviation of 6%. However, the metrics precision and recall were not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
