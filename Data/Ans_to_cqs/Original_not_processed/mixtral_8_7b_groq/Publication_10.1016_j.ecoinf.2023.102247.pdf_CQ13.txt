Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the use of a deep learning model in the study. The models mentioned in the context are an ensemble modeling approach using an ensemble of four different models, including one regression-based model, Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM), as well as Generalized Linear Models (GLM). There is no mention of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models.

Additionally, the context does not provide any information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, activation functions, batch size, or number of epochs.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
