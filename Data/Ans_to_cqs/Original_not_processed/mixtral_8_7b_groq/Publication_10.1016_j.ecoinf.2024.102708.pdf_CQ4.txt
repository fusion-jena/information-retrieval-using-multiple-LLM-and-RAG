Answer:::

The article discusses the use of deep learning models for detecting Pacific oysters, an invasive species, using remote sensing data. The training and validation datasets for the deep learning models were created using a dataset of tiles, some of which contained Pacific oysters. To augment the training dataset, random variations and manipulations were applied to the tiles containing Pacific oysters.

The data augmentations applied to the training data are as follows:

1. Flip: The tiles were flipped horizontally or vertically.
2. Crop: A portion of the tile was selected and used as a new tile.
3. Contrast Shift: The contrast of the tile was adjusted by changing the difference in color and brightness between objects and the background.
4. Translation: The tile was shifted horizontally or vertically by a certain percentage.
5. Rotation: The tile was rotated by a certain degree.

These augmentations were applied in a random order to create five augmented images for each original tile, resulting in a total of 5735 additional tiles. The training data set consisted of 70% of the tiles containing Pacific oysters and 30% of the validation tiles, along with the augmented images.

The article also mentions that two widely used object detection models, YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, were selected for comparison. Three variants of the YOLOv5 model were tested, including YOLOv5 small, YOLOv5 medium, and TPH-YOLOv5, a modified variant of YOLO with a Transformer Prediction Head.
