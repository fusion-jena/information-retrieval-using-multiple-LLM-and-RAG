Answer:::

The specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models for audio denoising in bioacoustics are not specified in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that deep noise reduction methods have been successfully applied in sub-real time on limited hardware (Defossez et al., 2020), which suggests the use of efficient and optimized frameworks.

Deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch are commonly used for building and training deep learning models. TensorFlow, developed by Google Brain, is a powerful and flexible framework that supports a wide range of neural network architectures and provides GPU acceleration. PyTorch, developed by Facebook's AI Research lab, is known for its simplicity and ease of use, with dynamic computation graphs and seamless transition between CPUs and GPUs.

Given the success of deep noise reduction techniques in NLP applications, it is likely that these frameworks have been used in the development of audio denoising models for bioacoustics. However, the specific choice of framework may depend on factors such as computational resources, model complexity, and researcher preference.

In summary, while the exact frameworks used for building deep learning models for audio denoising in bioacoustics are not specified in the provided context, TensorFlow and PyTorch are popular and widely used frameworks for deep learning that could be employed in this context.
