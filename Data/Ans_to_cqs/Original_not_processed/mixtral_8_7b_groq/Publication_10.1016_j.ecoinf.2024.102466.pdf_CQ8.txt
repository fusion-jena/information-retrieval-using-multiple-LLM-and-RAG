Answer:::

Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of the code repository location for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context focuses on the dataset, the methods used, and the results obtained, but it does not include any details about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide the specific location of the code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) for this deep learning pipeline.
