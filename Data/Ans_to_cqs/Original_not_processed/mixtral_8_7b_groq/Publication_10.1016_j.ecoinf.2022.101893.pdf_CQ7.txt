Answer:::

In the given context, the data is divided into a training set and a test set according to the ratio of 8:2. This means that 80% of the total samples are used for training the model, and the remaining 20% are used for testing the performance of the trained model. The number of test samples is 3094, so the number of training samples would be 12,340 (15,434 x 0.8).

It is important to note that the data is divided before building the classification models. The models are built using the training set, and the accuracy on the test set is used as an indicator to evaluate the performance of the classification models. This is a common approach in machine learning and deep learning, as it provides an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.

There is no mention of a validation set in the given context. A validation set is typically used during the training process to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. If a validation set was used, it would likely have been split from the training set, resulting in a final data split of 64% training, 16% validation, and 20% testing. However, the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.

In summary, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in the given context is a 80-20 split between the training set and the test set, respectively.
