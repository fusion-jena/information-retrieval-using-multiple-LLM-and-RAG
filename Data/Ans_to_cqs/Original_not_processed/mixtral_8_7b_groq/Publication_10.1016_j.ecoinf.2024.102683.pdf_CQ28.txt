The provided context does not mention which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the performance of various models, the proposed FAA-based approach, and the importance of attention mechanisms and data augmentation in deep learning. However, it does not specify the platform used for deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
