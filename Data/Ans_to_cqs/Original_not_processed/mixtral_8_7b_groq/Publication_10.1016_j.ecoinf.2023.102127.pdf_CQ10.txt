Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct information given about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline for curating less biased representations of a species niche. However, the context mentions the use of the "cmdstanr" package (Ceˇsnovar, 2022) in the process, which is an R interface to "CmdStan." This suggests that the code might be implemented in R or Stan language, and possibly available in a repository like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

To find the code repository, you could search for the papers' authors or the package author's repositories. Specifically, you may look for repositories of the following authors:

1. M. Jung (EcologicalInformatics76(2023)1021277)
2. Fois, M., Cuena-Lombra˜na, A., Fenu, G., Bacchetta, G. (Using species distribution models at local scale to guide the search of poorly known species: review, methodological issues and future directions, Ecol. Model. 385, 124–132, 2018)
3. R. Ceˇsnovar (cmdstanr: R Interface to “CmdStan.”)

When searching for these authors' repositories, you can use keywords like "deep learning," "species distribution models," "biodiversity," "R," or "Stan" to increase the chances of finding the relevant code repository.

Another approach is to look for the packages and functions they mentioned in their papers. For instance, "cmdstanr" and "Maxent" are mentioned in the context. You can search for repositories that use or develop these packages to find a deep learning pipeline for curating less biased representations of a species niche.

Please note that the code repository might be private or not available if the authors have not shared it publicly. In such cases, you may consider reaching out to the authors directly to request access to the code or collaborate on the project.
