Answer:::

The hyperparameters of the model were optimized based on studies that successfully implemented the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model in remote sensing cases. The author of the YOLO-based "Yolt" model suggested implementing the same hyperparameters as the YOLO model. The default parameters of YOLOV3 are 0.001, 0.9, and 0.0005 for the learning rate, momentum, and weight decay, respectively. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning. It is likely that the hyperparameters were set based on the successful implementation in previous studies rather than through a systematic hyperparameter optimization process. Nonetheless, the choice of the Adam learning rate optimizer over the static stochastic gradient descent (SGD) suggests that some consideration was given to the selection of appropriate optimization algorithms.
