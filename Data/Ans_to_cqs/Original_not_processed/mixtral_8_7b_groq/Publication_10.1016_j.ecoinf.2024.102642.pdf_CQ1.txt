The provided context does not give specific details about how raw data is collected for the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study uses cetacean vocalization data for training and evaluating deep learning models. We can infer that the data is likely collected through underwater Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) surveys using hydrophones to record audio signals.

In the context, it is mentioned that the study uses a dataset called SWAMS, which contains 7 hours of audio signals recorded during the OHASISBIO program in the Indian Ocean's oceanic zone between Kerguelen and Amsterdam Island. The recordings were made in March 2015 using a hydrophone deployed at a depth of 1000 m with a sampling rate of 240 Hz. This information suggests that the data was collected using a hydrophone survey.

Additionally, the context states that volunteer citizen scientists contribute to the annotation of large datasets. While this does not directly relate to data collection, it implies that the raw data used in the study is likely obtained from various sources, possibly including public datasets, surveys, or other research projects.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state the methods used for collecting raw data, it can be inferred that underwater PAM surveys using hydrophones are a likely source of the cetacean vocalization data used in the deep learning pipeline. Other possible sources include public datasets or other research projects.
