Answer:::

The generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through the implementation of k-fold cross-validation and dataset splitting. Cross-validation is a widely used evaluation method in machine learning that aids in preventing overfitting. In this study, a 10-fold cross-validation design was employed, where the dataset was divided into ten subsets. Some of these subsets were used for training the model, while the others were utilized to evaluate its performance. This process was repeated ten times, with each subset used once as the testing dataset. The final performance of the model was then determined by averaging the results from these ten iterations.

Furthermore, the dataset was split into two distinct sets for training and testing purposes. Specifically, 70% of the dataset was designated for model training, while the remaining 30% was used as the testing dataset. This approach ensured that the model was trained on a sufficient amount of data while also providing an independent dataset for evaluating its performance.

However, the provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the diversity of the dataset or stratified splitting. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets while preserving the distribution of important variables, which can help ensure the generalizability of the model. Nonetheless, the use of cross-validation and dataset splitting in this study provides a robust evaluation of the deep learning model's performance and helps ensure its generalizability.
