Answer:::

In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is stated that deep learning algorithms can be applied to hyperspectral data to predict water quality parameters, and that ML methods are prone to overfitting and the curse of dimensionality.

In general, there are several regularization methods that can be used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Dropout is a regularization technique that is commonly used in deep learning. It involves randomly dropping out, or "turning off," a proportion of the neurons in a layer during training. This helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons, which can occur when the model learns to rely too heavily on the output of a particular neuron.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is another regularization technique that can be used to prevent overfitting. It involves adding a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which can help to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.

Other regularization techniques that can be used in deep learning include early stopping, which involves terminating training early if the model's performance on a validation set stops improving; data augmentation, which involves artificially increasing the size of the training set by applying random transformations to the training examples; and batch normalization, which involves normalizing the inputs to each layer of the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, it is stated that deep learning algorithms can be applied to hyperspectral data to predict water quality parameters, and that ML methods are prone to overfitting and the curse of dimensionality. In general, there are several regularization techniques that can be used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models, including dropout, L2 regularization, early stopping, data augmentation, and batch normalization.
