Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific details about how the raw data was collected for the study. However, it does mention that the study utilized the WSGD (Water Surface Glint Dataset) for training, validating, and testing the Res_AUNet network. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data used in this deep learning pipeline was obtained from this specific dataset.

The WSGD dataset likely contains image pairs of water surfaces with and without sun glint, which were captured using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) as indicated by the term "UAV water images" in the context. The dataset was initially composed of a large number of image pairs, which were then processed and prepped for the deep learning pipeline.

The preprocessing steps included cropping the images to a size of 256 Ã— 256 pixels, resulting in a total of 1764 image pairs. These image pairs were further divided into three subsets: 1232 image pairs for training, 176 image pairs for validating the model accuracy during the training phase, and 356 image pairs for testing the performance of the trained network post-training.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly state the methods used for collecting the raw data, it can be inferred that the study utilized the WSGD dataset, which contains UAV water images captured for the purpose of training deep learning models for water sun glint detection.
