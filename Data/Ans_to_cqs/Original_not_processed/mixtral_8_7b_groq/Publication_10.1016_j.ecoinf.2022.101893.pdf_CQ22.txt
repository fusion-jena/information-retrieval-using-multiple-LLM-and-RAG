Answer: The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the metric of accuracy on the test set. The datasets are divided into a training set and a test set in a ratio of 8:2. The number of test samples and training samples are 3094 and 12,340, respectively. The classification models are built with the training set, and accuracy on the test set is used as an indicator to evaluate the performance of the classification models.

In the context provided, the accuracy of various features is reported for different models such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). For instance, the accuracy of feature F1 for the CNN model is 81.00%. Similarly, the accuracy of feature F4 for the RF, SVM, and MLP models is 82.92%, 85.59%, and 83.85%, respectively.

However, other metrics such as precision and recall are not explicitly mentioned in the context provided. Accuracy is a useful metric when the classes are balanced, but it may not be a good indicator when the classes are imbalanced. In such cases, precision and recall can provide more insights into the performance of the model. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives.

Therefore, while accuracy is used as a metric to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the provided context, other metrics such as precision and recall could also be useful depending on the class distribution.
