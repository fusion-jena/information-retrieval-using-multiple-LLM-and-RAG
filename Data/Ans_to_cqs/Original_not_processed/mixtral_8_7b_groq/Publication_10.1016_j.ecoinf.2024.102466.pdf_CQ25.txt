Answer:::
The deep learning models mentioned in the article are used for object detection, specifically for detecting wild bird species in images taken by camera traps. These models are not used for image classification or segmentation.

The study employed eight deep learning algorithms for bird object detection and evaluated their performance based on a dataset comprising 9717 images of 15 wild bird species acquired by camera traps in Chinaâ€™s Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park.

The article mentions the use of models such as Cascade RCNN, Faster CNN, ATSS, and RepPoint, among others. These models are designed to detect objects within an image, providing bounding boxes around the detected objects along with class labels indicating the type of object present.

In the context of this study, the deep learning models are used to detect and locate wild bird species within the camera trap images, enabling more efficient monitoring of wildlife populations over wide areas and over time. By reducing manual processing costs, these models can help conservation practitioners improve wildlife monitoring and environmental protection.
