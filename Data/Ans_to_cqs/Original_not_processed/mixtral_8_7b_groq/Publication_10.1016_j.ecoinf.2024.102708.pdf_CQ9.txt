Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context includes details about the training and validation datasets, the models used, and the number of tiles in the Scoble and Collapit sites. However, it does not mention where the data repository is located or which platform was used to share the data. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
