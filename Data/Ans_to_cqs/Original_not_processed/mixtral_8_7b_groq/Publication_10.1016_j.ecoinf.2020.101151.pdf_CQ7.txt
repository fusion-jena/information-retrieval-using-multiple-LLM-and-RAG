Answer:

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, we can make some educated guesses based on common practices in data splitting for machine learning models.

In the context of predicting forest fire danger, the data might be split based on the temporal distribution of the observations. For instance, one possible approach could be to use data from one year for training, data from another year for testing, and data from a third year for validation. This would ensure that the model is tested on data that it has not seen during training, providing a more realistic estimate of its performance.

Another possible approach could be to split the data based on spatial distribution. For example, observations from one region could be used for training, observations from another region for testing, and observations from a third region for validation. This would help to ensure that the model is not overfitting to specific characteristics of a particular region.

In the context of the nine-cell approach mentioned in the text, it is possible that the data was split based on the spatial arrangement of the cells. For instance, the central cell could be used for testing, the surrounding cells for training, and the cells at the edge of the grid for validation. This would allow for a smooth transition from the training data to the testing data, potentially improving the performance of the model.

Finally, it is also possible that the data was split randomly, without any particular consideration for the temporal or spatial distribution of the observations. However, this approach is generally less common, as it can lead to overfitting or underfitting if the random splits are not representative of the overall distribution of the data.

In summary, while the provided context does not give a clear answer to the question of how the data was split for deep learning model training, we can make some educated guesses based on common practices in machine learning. The data might have been split based on temporal or spatial distribution, or possibly in a random manner.
