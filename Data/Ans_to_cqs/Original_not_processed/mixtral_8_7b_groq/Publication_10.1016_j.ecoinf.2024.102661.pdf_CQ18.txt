During the training process of the TPEBO-LSTM model, a systematic strategy is implemented to monitor and optimize its performance. This involves recording specific details during each iteration, including the chosen hyperparameter combinations, training times, and loss values. These systematic recordings aim to identify the hyperparameter sets that deliver optimal performance upon completion of the calculations.

The training process consists of 10,000 iterations. In each iteration, the model logs the hyperparameter combinations, training times, and loss values. This approach allows for a thorough examination of the model's performance at various stages of the training process.

Moreover, the model undergoes optimization using the L2 regularization parameter. Adjusting this parameter helps control overfitting by penalizing large weights. The search range for this parameter is set between 1e-10 and 1e-2, in line with benchmarks from similar studies. This regularization technique aids in monitoring the model's performance by discouraging overly complex models and promoting generalization.

The TPEBO-LSTM neural network's development involves three essential steps, ensuring a comprehensive approach to hyperparameter optimization. The first step is defining the hyperparameter search range, where the bounds for various hyperparameters are specified. For instance, the number of hidden layers is set between 1 and 3, based on initial tests. This range helps monitor the model's performance by ensuring a balance between capturing intricate data patterns and avoiding overfitting.

Furthermore, the initial learning rate is set to determine the step size during parameter updates. The chosen range, [1e-3, 1e-2], reflects a balance between avoiding too rapid updates (which can cause instability) and too slow updates (leading to prolonged training). This learning rate strategy helps monitor the model's performance by ensuring stable and efficient updates.

In summary, the model performance is systematically monitored during training through iterative logging of hyperparameter combinations, training times, and loss values. Additionally, L2 regularization, learning rate strategies, and defining the hyperparameter search range are employed to ensure optimal performance and prevent overfitting.
