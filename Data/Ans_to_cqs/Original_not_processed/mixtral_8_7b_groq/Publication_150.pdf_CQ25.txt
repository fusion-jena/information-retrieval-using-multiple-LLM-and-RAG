Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning models used in the study mentioned in the context is classification. Specifically, they are used for bumble bee species classification.

The four models compared in the study are ResNet-101, Wide-ResNet-101, InceptionV3, and MnasNet-A1. These models are all based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), which are a type of deep learning model commonly used for image classification tasks.

The study aimed to evaluate the trade-offs between accuracy and speed of these models for bumble bee species classification. The models vary in complexity of architecture, with some having more layers and channels than others.

The ResNet-101 model uses skip connections, which allow useful layer output to pass over groups of layers and penetrate deeper into the network. This helps to address the vanishing gradient problem, which is a common limitation of deep neural networks.

The Wide-ResNet-101 model is wider but shallower than ResNet-101. This allows information to pass through the network more easily while providing a greater number of channels to maintain performance.

The InceptionV3 model has fewer layers than the other models but achieves greater computational efficiency by using factorized convolution. This breaks down channels into simpler linear sequences while maintaining spatial context within the image.

The MnasNet-A1 model was designed to be faster for mobile devices and has the fewest layers of the models compared in the study.

Overall, the purpose of these deep learning models is to classify bumble bee species based on images. The study evaluated the trade-offs between accuracy and speed of these models to determine which one is the most suitable for this task.
