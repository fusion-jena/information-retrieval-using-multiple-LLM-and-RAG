Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline of the study. The study mentioned is about detecting underwater man-made objects using optical and SAS data. The methodology, datasets, findings, discussions, and conclusions are described in detail, but there is no information about data augmentation techniques. Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size of the training dataset and improve model performance by creating variations of the existing data. However, without specific information from the study, it is not possible to provide a precise answer to this query.
