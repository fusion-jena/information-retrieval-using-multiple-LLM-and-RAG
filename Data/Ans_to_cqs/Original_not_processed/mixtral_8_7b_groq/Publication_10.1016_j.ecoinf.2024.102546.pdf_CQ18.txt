Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves evaluating the performance metrics on the test set over three replications and then averaging them for eventual model assessment. In each replication, the dataset is partitioned into training, validation, and testing sets with a different random seed. This approach allows for a more robust evaluation of the model's performance, as it accounts for variability in the data split. The weed detection modeling is conducted in the PyTorch framework, using Torchvision, OpenCV, and CUDNN libraries on an NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU. However, the context does not provide information on specific performance metrics used for monitoring the model performance during training.
