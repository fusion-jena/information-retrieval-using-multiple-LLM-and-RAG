Answer:::

The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP) as the evaluation indicators of the model detection accuracy.

Precision is the measure of the correctness of the model, which is calculated as the ratio of true positive predictions (correctly identified positive samples) to the total positive predictions (both true positives and false positives). It indicates the proportion of relevant instances among the retrieved instances.

Recall, on the other hand, is the measure of the completeness of the model, which is calculated as the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positive samples. It indicates the proportion of relevant instances that were retrieved.

Mean average precision (mAP) is a composite metric that combines precision and recall into a single metric. It is calculated as the average precision value over all recall levels, providing a single metric that captures both the precision and recall of the model.

In addition to these metrics, the model's complexity is gauged by the number of parameters (Params), giga floating-point operations (GFLOPs), number of model network layers (Layers), and frames per second (FPS), whereas the memory footprint (memory) assesses the model's size. These metrics provide insights into the computational efficiency and resource utilization of the model.

Therefore, the deep learning model's performance is evaluated using precision, recall, and mAP as the primary metrics, along with other metrics that provide insights into the model's complexity and computational efficiency.
