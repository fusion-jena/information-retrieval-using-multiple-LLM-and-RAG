Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in this particular scenario involves image data. The models are trained and tested on various image datasets, including the trash-ICRA19 dataset, VisDrone dataset, NWPU VHR-10 dataset, and HRSID dataset. These datasets are used to assess the performance of YWnet in different scenarios, such as marine environments and detecting tiny target objects in remote sensing.

The SRC3 block, a crucial component of the model, employs a parallel analysis of the input feature map using two convolution kernels. This process is used for extracting input information and results in a broader receptive field of information and richer characteristics. The output semantic information is then augmented by the action of two convolution kernels.

However, the context does not mention the use of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV. Therefore, based on the given information, the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data.
