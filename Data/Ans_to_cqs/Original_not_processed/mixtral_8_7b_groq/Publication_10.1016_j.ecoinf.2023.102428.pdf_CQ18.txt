Answer:::

Based on the information provided, it appears that the strategy for monitoring the model's performance during training involves tracking the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Accuracy Rate at various stages of the training process.

Specifically, the training process involves a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model with 8 input layer neurons, 10 hidden layer nodes, and 8 output layer neurons. The model is trained on 1688 requested samples per class, starting with a learning rate of 0.0008 and ending with a learning rate of 0.0001. The momentum factor is set to 0.5, and the sigmoid constant is set to 1.0. The model is trained for 10,000 iterations, with an acceptable RMSE of 0.01.

During the training process, the RMSE is calculated after each iteration to monitor the model's performance. The RMSE is a measure of the difference between the values predicted by the model and the actual values. A lower RMSE indicates better performance. In this case, the training RMSE is 0.1430, and the testing RMSE is 0.1446.

Additionally, the Accuracy Rate is calculated to assess the model's performance. The Accuracy Rate is the percentage of inputs that are correctly classified by the model. In this case, the Accuracy Rate is 88.79%.

Overall, it appears that the strategy for monitoring the model's performance during training involves tracking the RMSE and Accuracy Rate at various stages of the training process. This allows for the identification of any issues with the model's performance and adjustments to be made as needed.
