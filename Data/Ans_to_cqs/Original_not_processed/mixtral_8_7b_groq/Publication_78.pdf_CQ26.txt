The provided context does not directly discuss data bias or techniques used during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss different classifiers and their performance in classifying coral reef data.

In the context, several classifiers are used for classifying coral reef data, including SVM Kernel, LBP, HOG, LETRIST, GLCM, CJLBP, LTrP, AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, GoogleNet, Inceptionv3, CoralNet, and BoF. These classifiers are trained and tested using a dataset, and their performance is evaluated based on sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1-score, and Cohen's Kappa.

While the context does not discuss data bias, it does mention the need for a massive dataset for better accuracy in classifying coral reef data using deep convolutional neural network VGG-19. This suggests that having a diverse and large dataset can help improve the performance of classifiers.

To address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be used, such as:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain criteria, such as class labels, and then randomly splitting each subgroup into training and testing sets. This ensures that each set has a similar distribution of classes, reducing bias.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances in the minority class to balance the dataset. This can help reduce bias by ensuring that each class is represented equally in the dataset.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances in the majority class to balance the dataset. This can help reduce bias by ensuring that each class is represented equally in the dataset.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is diverse and representative of the population. This can help reduce bias by ensuring that the dataset includes instances from all relevant subgroups.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not directly discuss data bias or techniques used during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, it does highlight the importance of having a diverse and large dataset for improving the performance of classifiers. To address data bias during preprocessing, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be used.
