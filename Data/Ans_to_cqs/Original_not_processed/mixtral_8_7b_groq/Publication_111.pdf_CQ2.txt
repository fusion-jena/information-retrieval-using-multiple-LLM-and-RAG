Answer:::

The data format used in the deep learning pipeline for predicting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the data is likely in a CSV or similar structured format, as the paper mentions the use of a GRU model architecture for forecasting SST and SWH on a real dataset obtained from the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency. It is common for such oceanographic data to be available in structured formats like CSV or NetCDF.

Additionally, the comparison of the deep learning model with machine learning models and a statistical predictive model suggests that the data is numerical and amenable to regression analysis. The deep learning model combines a GRU layer with a regular neural network, which takes a sequential input and processes it through time steps. This architecture is suitable for handling time-series data, which further supports the inference that the data format is likely structured and time-dependent.
