Answer:::

The provided context discusses the data collection process and performance metrics used in a deep-learning pipeline for toxicovigilance but does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. However, it does mention that the data was split using the train\_test\_split function from the scikit-learn library, which performs randomized shuffling and division of datasets into distinct training and testing subsets. It also mentions that individuals from the control and pesticide-exposed groups were evenly distributed between these subsets, guaranteeing a balanced representation of each class.

Additionally, the context mentions the research paper "Cross-validation for imbalanced datasets: avoiding overoptimistic and overfitting approaches" by Santos et al., which suggests that cross-validation and resampling techniques such as oversampling and undersampling can be used to address data bias and imbalance in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, it can be inferred that techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection may have been used during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline described in the context, but it is not explicitly stated.
