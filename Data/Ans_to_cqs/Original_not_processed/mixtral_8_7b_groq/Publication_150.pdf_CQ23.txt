Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it is mentioned that data augmentation was used, which is a technique that can help improve the model's ability to generalize.

Data augmentation involves creating new training examples by applying various transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping. This can help the model learn to be invariant to these transformations and improve its performance on unseen data.

Additionally, the use of batch normalization can also help improve the model's generalizability. Batch normalization is a technique that normalizes the activations of the neurons in a layer, which can help reduce internal covariate shift and improve the model's stability during training.

Furthermore, the use of a validation set to tune hyperparameters such as the learning rate and the number of epochs can also help improve the model's generalizability. The learning rate was reduced by a factor of 10 after steps of 30 epochs, which can help the model converge to a better minimum and improve its performance on unseen data.

Overall, while there is no explicit information about the use of diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, the use of data augmentation, batch normalization, and hyperparameter tuning can help improve the model's generalizability. However, it would be beneficial to have more information about the dataset and the specific techniques used to ensure the model's generalizability.
