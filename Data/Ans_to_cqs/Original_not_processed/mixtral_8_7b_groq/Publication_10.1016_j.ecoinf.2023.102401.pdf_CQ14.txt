The context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization methods. The text focuses on the comparison of different networks and attention modules, as well as the performance evaluation metrics like accuracy, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAp). It also describes the datasets used and the data augmentation techniques. However, the specifics of hyperparameter optimization are not covered in the provided context.
