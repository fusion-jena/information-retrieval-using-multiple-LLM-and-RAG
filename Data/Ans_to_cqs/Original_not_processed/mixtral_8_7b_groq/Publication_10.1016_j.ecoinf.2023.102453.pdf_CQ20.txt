Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text focuses more on the techniques and methods used to optimize and improve the model's performance, such as hyperparameter optimization, neural architecture search (NAS), and transfer learning with fine-tuning.

However, it does mention that these models are intended for deployment on small microcontroller devices, which suggests that the training of the models was likely done on more powerful hardware, such as CPUs, GPUs, or TPUs. This is a common practice in the field of machine learning, where models are trained on high-performance hardware and then deployed to edge devices for inference.

In summary, while the text does not provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, it can be inferred that the training was likely done on more powerful hardware, and the models were then optimized for deployment on smaller microcontroller devices.
