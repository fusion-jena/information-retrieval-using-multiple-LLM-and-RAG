The generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through a balanced sampling strategy during the creation of the test set. Specifically, one audio sample (along with its corresponding data augmentation samples) was selected out of every five samples for each type of anuran call. This approach aimed to prevent overfitting and enhance the model's ability to generalize. Additionally, 80% of the total samples were utilized for training, while the remaining 20% were reserved for testing. This training-testing split is a widely used strategy in machine learning to improve the model's generalization capabilities. However, there is no explicit mention of techniques such as diverse dataset creation, cross-validation, or stratified splitting in the provided context.
