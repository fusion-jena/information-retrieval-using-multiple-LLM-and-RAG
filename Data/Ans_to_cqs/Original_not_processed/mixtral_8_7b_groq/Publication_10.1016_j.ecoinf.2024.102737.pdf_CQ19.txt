Answer:::
The specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models in the study mentioned are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the implementations of the two Siamese architecture versions are taken from the open sources of Choi (2020) and Siyah (2020). These open sources could be implementations in any deep learning framework, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or others. Therefore, while the specific frameworks are not identified, it is clear that the models are built using existing open-source implementations in some deep learning framework.
