After reviewing the provided sources, I was unable to find information about the specific location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline.

Source 1 by Zhuang et al., 2022 describes a pipeline for reducing the barriers associated with curating and mining big data of insect biodiversity, but it does not mention the location of the code repository.

Source 2 by Schneider et al., 2023 discusses the importance of advancing ecological research on arthropods through computer vision, but it does not provide information about the code repository.

Source 3 by Teixeira et al., 2023 provides a systematic review of automatic insect detection using deep learning, but it does not mention the location of the code repository for any specific pipeline.

Source 4 by Wang et al., 2020 introduces Pest24, a large-scale very small object data set of agricultural pests for multi-target detection, but it does not provide information about the code repository for the pipeline.

Source 5 by Ciampi et al., 2023 describes a deep learning-based pipeline for whitefly pest abundance estimation on chromotropic sticky traps, but it does not mention the location of the code repository.

Source 6 by Faria et al., 2021 discusses AI-powered mobile image acquisition of vineyard insect traps with automatic quality and adequacy assessment, but it does not provide information about the code repository.

Source 7 by Gallmann et al., 2022 presents flower mapping in grasslands with drones and deep learning, but it does not mention the location of the code repository.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as the information is not available in the provided sources.
