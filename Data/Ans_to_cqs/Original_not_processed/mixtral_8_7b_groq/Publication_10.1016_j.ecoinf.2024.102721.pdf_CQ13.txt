Based on the information provided, the deep learning model used in the study is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model. The LSTM model has a special memory unit that effectively addresses the issue of gradient vanishing and explosion in RNN for long-term sequences. The LSTM memory unit comprises a forget gate, input gate, output gate, and hidden layer, and signals are transmitted between different units through three control gates in the hidden layer.

The study mentions the use of Bayesian optimization (BO) for tuning the hyperparameters of the LSTM model to achieve high simulation accuracy and improve the performance of the model on unseen data. Bayesian optimization is a global optimization algorithm that optimizes the hyperparameters in ML models based on the Bayesian theorem to estimate the posterior distribution of target functions. It establishes a provisional surrogate function based on past evaluations of unknown target functions and continues to search for the next set of hyperparameters that minimize the surrogate function.

However, the specific hyperparameters used in the LSTM model and the range of values considered for optimization are not provided in the given context. Common hyperparameters in deep learning models include learning rate, optimizer, number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each layer, activation function, batch size, and number of epochs. The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function, and the optimizer is a method used to update the weights and biases in the model based on the gradient of the loss function.

Therefore, while the study mentions the use of Bayesian optimization for tuning the hyperparameters of the LSTM model, the specific hyperparameters used are not provided in the given context.
