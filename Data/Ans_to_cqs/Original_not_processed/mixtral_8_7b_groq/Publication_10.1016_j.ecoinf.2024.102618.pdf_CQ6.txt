Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include balancing the dataset using the class-weighted technique and proposing a novel image pre-processing technique. However, the specific details of this image pre-processing technique are not provided in the context.

In addition to these, the dataset is balanced to address the issue of deep learning models having a bias towards classes with a large number of images. This is important as the proposed dataset is imbalanced, and a simple algorithm like class-weighted is used to balance it.

Furthermore, an image enhancement technique is added to provide crystal-clear images for further examination. This technique enables the proposed systems to reach high accuracy values. However, it is not explicitly mentioned if this technique involves any normalization, scaling, or cleaning of the dataset.

Therefore, while the context provides some insight into the preprocessing steps involved, it does not explicitly mention any specific data normalization, scaling, or cleaning techniques that are used before training the deep learning models.
