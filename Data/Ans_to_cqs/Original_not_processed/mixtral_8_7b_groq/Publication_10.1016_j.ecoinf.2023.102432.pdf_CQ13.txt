Based on the provided context, there is no information about the use of deep learning models in any of the studies. The papers mentioned use various techniques such as multiple-instance learning, airborne hyperspectral imagery classification, and multitarget multiple-instance learning for hyperspectral target detection. However, they do not specify any deep learning models or their hyperparameters.

Answer:::

Confusion matrices are used in several studies to evaluate the performance of their algorithms. These matrices show the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. For example, Meerdink et al. (2019) report a confusion matrix calculated on 20% of the data not used for training, and Cawse-Nicholson et al. provide confusion matrices for RapidEye and Landsat imagery using Random Forest. However, these studies do not involve deep learning models.

Answer:::

In the study by Morton (1978), the impact of Brazilian pepper on people, animals, and the environment is discussed. The paper does not involve any machine learning techniques or deep learning models.

Answer:::

Bunescu and Mooney (2007) present a method for learning to extract relations from the web using minimal supervision. Their approach involves using a small set of seed instances and a large corpus of unlabeled text. While they do not use deep learning models, their work focuses on relation extraction, which is a task within natural language processing.

Answer:::

Asner et al. (2008) explore invasive species detection in Hawaiian rainforests using airborne imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR. They use a Random Forest classifier and report its performance. However, they do not mention any deep learning models or their hyperparameters.

Answer:::

Blossey (1999) emphasizes the need for long-term monitoring in invasive plant species management. The paper does not involve any machine learning techniques or deep learning models.

In conclusion, there is no information in the provided context about the use of deep learning models and their hyperparameters.
