Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention which cloud platform, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform, was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the hardware platform used for the experiment was a desktop computer with specific specifications, and several software tools were used, including Anaconda3, PyCharm 2020.1, Python 3.7, TensorFlow 2.6, and MATLAB 2018b. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was deployed on a local desktop computer rather than a cloud platform.
