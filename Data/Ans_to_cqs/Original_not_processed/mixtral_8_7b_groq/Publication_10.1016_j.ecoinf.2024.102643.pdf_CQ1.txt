The provided context does not contain specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some studies and tools used for analyzing and predicting patterns related to brown bears and their habitats.

In the study by Busby (1991), the BIOCLIM: a bioclimatic analysis and prediction system was used. This system likely involves the use of environmental data and possibly species occurrence data, but it does not explicitly mention the data collection methods.

The study by Özüdoğru et al. (2004) on the status and management of brown bears in Turkey might have used field surveys, camera traps, or other methods to collect raw data on bear populations and human-bear conflicts. However, the context does not provide specific details about the data collection methods.

The study by Özüdoğru et al. (2014) on resolving human-bear conflicts involved a global survey of experts and key factors. This study likely used questionnaires or interviews as the data collection method.

The context also includes tables with environmental layers and their frequencies of occurrence in different regions. These environmental layers could have been obtained from public datasets, remote sensing, or other sources. However, the context does not provide information on how these layers were collected.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query about data collection methods in deep learning pipelines, it suggests that studies on brown bears and human-bear conflicts might have used various methods such as surveys, camera traps, remote sensing, and public datasets.
