Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of several deep learning models, including YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, which are typically trained using optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or its variants like Adam. These algorithms are used to minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance. Therefore, while the specific optimization techniques are not mentioned, it is reasonable to assume that SGD or a similar method was used in the training of these models.
