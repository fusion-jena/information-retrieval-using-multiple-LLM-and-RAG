Answer:::

The provided context discusses the evaluation metrics used in a land cover classification study, which involves the use of a semi-automatic classification plugin (SCP) and a random forest (RF) classifier. However, it does not explicitly mention the performance metrics used for a deep learning model.

In general, for evaluating the performance of a deep learning model in image classification tasks, the following metrics are commonly used:

1. Accuracy: It is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. It gives an overall idea of how well the model is performing.
2. Precision: It is the ratio of true positive predictions (correctly predicted positive samples) to the total predicted positive samples. It gives an idea of how precise the model is when it predicts a particular class.
3. Recall (Sensitivity): It is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positive samples. It gives an idea of how well the model is able to identify all the positive samples.
4. F1-score: It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and provides a balance between the two metrics.
5. Confusion Matrix: It is a table that summarizes the predictions made by the model, and helps in calculating other metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Mean IoU (Intersection over Union): It is a metric used for semantic segmentation tasks, and calculates the area of overlap between the predicted and ground truth masks, divided by the area of union.

In the context of land cover classification, the following additional metrics are used:

1. Error of Commission (EC): It is the ratio of incorrectly classified pixels to the total number of pixels in the classified map.
2. Error of Omission (EO): It is the ratio of unclassified pixels to the total number of pixels in the ground truth map.
3. Producer Accuracy (PA): It is the ratio of correctly classified pixels in a particular class to the total number of pixels in that class in the ground truth map.
4. User Accuracy (UA): It is the ratio of correctly classified pixels in a particular class to the total number of pixels classified as that class in the classified map.

Therefore, depending on the specific deep learning model and the task at hand, the appropriate evaluation metrics should be chosen.
