Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it is stated that the species assemblage predictor is not biased by heterogeneous sampling effort, indicating that stratified sampling based on sampling effort might not be a concern in this case.

The context does mention that the species assemblage predictor is impacted by species detection bias, which is the fact that some species might be observed more than others conditionally to a given input. This implies that the model could potentially benefit from techniques aimed at addressing class imbalance, such as oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class. However, the text does not explicitly confirm if these techniques are used.

Additionally, the model is optimized on a set of presence-only observations, and the training procedure details are provided in supplementary information (SI) Box A. To get a complete understanding of the preprocessing techniques used, one would need to refer to this box.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, it implies that class imbalance techniques might be used to address species detection bias. For a comprehensive understanding, it is recommended to refer to the supplementary information provided.
