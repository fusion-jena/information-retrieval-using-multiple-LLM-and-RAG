Answer:::

The text provided does not give specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It mentions some details about the model's architecture, such as the number of filters in each convolution layer, the kernel size, and the number of neurons in the fully connected layer. However, it does not mention any methods used for hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization.

Hyperparameter tuning is an essential step in training machine learning models, as it can significantly impact the model's performance. Grid search and random search are two common methods for hyperparameter tuning. Grid search involves creating a grid of hyperparameter values and training the model with each combination. Random search, on the other hand, involves randomly selecting hyperparameter values and training the model with those values. Bayesian optimization is another method that uses Bayesian inference to select the next set of hyperparameters to try based on the previous results.

Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to answer this question definitively. The authors may have used one of the above methods or a different method entirely. It would be helpful if the authors provided more details about their hyperparameter tuning process in their paper.
