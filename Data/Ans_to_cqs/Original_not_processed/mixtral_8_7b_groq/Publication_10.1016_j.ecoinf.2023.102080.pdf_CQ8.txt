Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating that the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is available on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The article "Too many candidates: Embedded covariate selection procedure for species distribution modelling with the covsel R package" published in the Ecological Informatics journal introduces an "embedded" covariate selection procedure for species distribution models using the covsel R package. However, the context does not mention any deep learning techniques or code repositories.

The article presents a two-step procedure that combines a collinearity-filtering algorithm with three model-specific embedded regularization techniques, including generalized linear model with elastic net regularization, generalized additive model with null-space penalization, and guided regularized random forest. These techniques aim to optimize the predictive ability and parsimony of species distribution models in a high-dimensional candidate covariate space.

The authors provide details about the algorithms, correlation coefficient threshold, and covariate names used in the study. However, there is no information about deep learning pipelines or code repositories. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.

An alternative source for obtaining the code repository would be to contact the authors directly. The article provides the authors' names, affiliations, and email addresses. They might be able to provide more information about the code repository or any related resources.
