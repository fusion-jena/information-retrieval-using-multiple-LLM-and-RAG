Answer:::
The provided context does not give a specific link to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline used in Pl@ntNet. However, it does mention the availability of R-package 'plantnet' (<https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/plantnet>) and Photosearcher 1.0 (<https://docs.ropensci.org/photosearcher/>) which may be related to the pipeline.

Moreover, it mentions that the training of Pl@ntNet CNN requires high-performance computing infrastructure and expertise in deep, distributed, and large-scale learning. This implies that the code repository might be complex and not publicly available due to the technical specificities and infrastructure requirements.

Therefore, it can be said that the code repository of the deep learning pipeline used in Pl@ntNet is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
