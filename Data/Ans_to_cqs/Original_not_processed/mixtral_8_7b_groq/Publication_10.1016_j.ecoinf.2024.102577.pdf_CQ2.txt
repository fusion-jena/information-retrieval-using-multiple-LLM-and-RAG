Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the deep learning pipeline used in the study. However, it does mention the use of various types of data that could be used in a deep learning pipeline.

The study by Goikoetxea et al. (n.d.) on sustainable fishing in the Indian Ocean uses data related to fisheries oceanography, such as sea level anomaly, mixed layer depth, bottom temperature, sea surface temperature (SST), net primary production, dissolved molecular oxygen concentration, chlorophyll concentration, chlorophyll fronts, SST fronts, thermocline intensity, thermocline depth, temperature gradient, bathymetry, latitude, longitude, and month. These data could be stored in formats such as CSV or NetCDF, which are commonly used for oceanographic data.

The study by Honarmand Ebrahimi et al. (2021) on smart fishery using AI mentions the use of species distribution models, which typically use raster data in formats such as GeoTIFF or ASCII grid. They also mention the use of R, a programming language commonly used for statistical computing and data analysis, which can handle various data formats including CSV, NetCDF, and raster formats.

The study by Watson (2018) on fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions of world fisheries does not provide specific information about the data formats used. However, it is mentioned that the data was obtained from various sources, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), which provide data in various formats including CSV and NetCDF.

The study by Reilly and Fiedler (1994) on interannual variability of dolphin habitats in the eastern tropical Pacific uses data from research vessel surveys, but does not provide specific information about the data formats used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that various data formats such as CSV, NetCDF, raster formats, and possibly others, could be used in a deep learning pipeline for fisheries research.
