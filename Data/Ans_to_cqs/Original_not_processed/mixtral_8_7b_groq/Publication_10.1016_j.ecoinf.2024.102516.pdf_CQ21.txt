Answer:::
The provided context discusses the three-phase processing pipeline for training a network to estimate plant cover, but it does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps after the model training. However, it does mention the use of class activation mapping (CAM) in the first phase of training, which can be used as a form of postprocessing to generate weak segmentation maps.

In the first phase, a classification network is trained using GBIF image data, and CAM is applied to generate weak segmentation maps. These maps can be considered as a form of postprocessing since they are generated after the initial training of the classification network.

In the second phase, these weak segmentation maps are used for training a segmentation network on the GBIF image data. After the training of the segmentation network, the network's weights can be used to either train a plant cover prediction network on actual vegetation data or apply the network directly to vegetation data to generate zero-shot predictions without any training on plant cover annotations.

However, the context does not mention any specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. Saliency maps can be used as a postprocessing step to highlight the important regions of the image that the model is focusing on. Metrics calculation and confusion matrix can be used to evaluate the performance of the model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include generating weak segmentation maps using CAM and applying the trained network to generate zero-shot predictions. However, other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, and confusion matrix are not mentioned.
