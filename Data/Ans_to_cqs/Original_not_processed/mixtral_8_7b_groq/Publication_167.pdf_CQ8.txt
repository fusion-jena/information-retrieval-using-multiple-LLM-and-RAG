Answer:::

 Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on describing the methodology, data, and results of a land use and cover change (LUCC) study, but it does not mention or provide a link to the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the code repository.
