The provided context does not directly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does discuss the evaluation of a carbon emission estimation model using relative errors between fitted and statistical values.

In the context, the accuracy of the urban carbon emission estimates is assessed by comparing the errors between the fitted values and the statistical values of carbon emissions. Specifically, the relative errors during the period of 2000-2004 were found to be significant, indicating inaccuracies in the estimation of carbon emissions based on NPP-VIIRS-like NTL data in the early stages of urban lighting development in the reform and opening-up period.

While this approach is not a direct evaluation of a deep learning model, it does involve comparing the estimated values (fitted values) with the actual values (statistical values) to assess the accuracy of the estimation model. In the context of deep learning, this could be likened to evaluating the performance of a deep learning model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score, which all involve comparing the predicted values with the actual values.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the performance of a deep learning model used for carbon emission estimation could be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score, which all involve comparing the predicted values with the actual values. However, the specific metrics used in the study discussed in the context are not explicitly mentioned.
