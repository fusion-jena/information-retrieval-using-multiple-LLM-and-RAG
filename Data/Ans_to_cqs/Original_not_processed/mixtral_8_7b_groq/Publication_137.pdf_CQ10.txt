Answer:::
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the methodology and application of a deep learning-based point cloud processing framework for tree species segmentation, but it does not give information about where the code for this pipeline can be found. Therefore, I am unable to provide you with the requested link to the code repository on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
