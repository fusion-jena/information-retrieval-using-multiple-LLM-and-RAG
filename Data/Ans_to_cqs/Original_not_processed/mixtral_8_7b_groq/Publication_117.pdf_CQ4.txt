The provided context discusses a study that uses citizen science and deep learning methods to count wildebeest in survey images, but it does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is common practice to use data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling in deep learning projects involving image analysis.

Data augmentation is a strategy that enables researchers to increase the diversity of training data by applying various transformations to the existing images. This approach can help improve the model's ability to generalize and reduce overfitting. Common data augmentation techniques for image data include:

1. Flipping: This technique involves horizontally or vertically flipping images. Horizontal flipping is more common, as it can help the model learn symmetry and be more robust to changes in orientation.
2. Rotating: Images can be rotated by a certain angle, which can help the model learn to recognize objects regardless of their orientation in the image.
3. Scaling: Images can be scaled up or down, which can help the model learn to recognize objects at different sizes.
4. Translation: Images can be translated or shifted horizontally or vertically, which can help the model learn to recognize objects in different positions within the image.
5. Color jittering: This technique involves randomly changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue of images, which can help the model learn to recognize objects under different lighting conditions or color schemes.

While the provided context does not mention the specific data augmentation techniques used in the study, it is likely that some or all of these techniques were applied to improve the deep learning model's performance.
