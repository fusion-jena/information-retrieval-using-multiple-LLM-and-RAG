The context provided does not give information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that a spectral-spatial paralleled convolutional neural network (SSPCNN) was proposed for forest species classification using hyperspectral images captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The training and testing of the model were done using the labeled pixels of the UAV hyperspectral image, which was split into a training set and a test set with a ratio of 1:9. However, it does not specify where or how the model was deployed.
