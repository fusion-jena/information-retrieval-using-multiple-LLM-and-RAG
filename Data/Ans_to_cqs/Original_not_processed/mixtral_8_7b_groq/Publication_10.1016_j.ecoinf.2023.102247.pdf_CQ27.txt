Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the deployment of a trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the use of an ensemble modeling approach in the BIOMOD2 package in R to predict the distribution of study species using various environmental and geographical variables. The models' performance was tested using cross-validation and the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) as the accuracy index. However, there is no mention of deep learning models, model serialization, or platform selection in the given text.
