Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of a confusion matrix and accuracy metrics calculated on a separate portion of the data not used for training. Specifically, 20% of the data was held back and used for testing the model, and the confusion matrix was calculated for each iteration of the 5 K-Folds cross-validation used. The overall, producer, and user accuracy are reported for both RapidEye and Landsat imagery using the Random Forest algorithm.

In addition, the strategy includes the use of a machine learning approach called MTMI-SMF, which is formulated to work with imperfect data. This is important because most machine learning approaches require a single pixel to represent a training location, which can be problematic if the training locations have locational errors or do not ideally match with image pixels. MTMI-SMF, on the other hand, groups pixels surrounding a training location that could have the invader, which allows for more accurate representation of the training data.

It is also worth noting that the study referenced Blossey (1999) for the importance of long-term monitoring in invasive plant species management. Therefore, it can be inferred that the strategy for monitoring model performance during training is part of a larger effort for long-term monitoring and management of invasive species.

Another important aspect of the strategy is the comparison of MTMI-SMF classification to a commonly used machine learning classification approach, Random Forest. This allows for the evaluation of the performance of the MTMI-SMF algorithm in comparison to a well-established and widely used machine learning method.

Overall, the strategy for monitoring model performance during training involves the use of a separate test dataset, confusion matrix, and accuracy metrics, as well as the use of a machine learning approach that can handle imperfect data. Additionally, the strategy includes a comparison to a commonly used machine learning classification approach and a consideration for long-term monitoring and management of invasive species.
