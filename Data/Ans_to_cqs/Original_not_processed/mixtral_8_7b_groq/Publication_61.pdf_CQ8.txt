Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the methodology, case study, and experiments related to the training of a neural network for columnar cactus recognition in aerial images. While it mentions the use of a CNN and pre-trained networks, there is no reference to the code repository's location. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
