Based on the provided context, there is no information suggesting that a specific deep learning model, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer, is used in the mentioned studies.

The first study, "Unintended consequences of combating desertification in China" by Su et al., 2023, focuses on the unintended consequences of desertification control policies in China. They used statistical methods and satellite data to analyze the changes in land use/cover and their impact on the ecosystem. However, they did not mention any deep learning models.

The second study, "Global assessment of lagged and cumulative effects of drought on grassland gross primary production" by Wei et al., 2022, investigates the impact of drought on grassland productivity with a global perspective. They used statistical methods and ecological models to analyze the data but did not mention any deep learning models.

The third study, "Time-lag effects of global vegetation responses to climate change" by Wu et al., 2015, explores the time-lag effects of climate change on global vegetation. They used statistical methods and vegetation models to analyze the data but did not mention any deep learning models.

The fourth study, "Quantifying the contribution of land use/cover change to grassland spectral spatial heterogeneity" by Chen et al., 2024, quantifies the contribution of land use/cover change to grassland spectral spatial heterogeneity. They introduced a new index, GSN, and used statistical methods to analyze the data but did not mention any deep learning models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in these studies.
