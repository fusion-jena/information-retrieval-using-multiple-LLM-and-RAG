The text provided does not give specific details about the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. However, it does provide information about the training process. The model was trained for 200 epochs using the Adam optimizer with a batch size of 16. The learning rate was initially set at 0.001 and was reduced in a step-wise manner when the validation loss remained constant for five epochs. The hyper-parameter λ was set to 0.8, and β was set to 0.4. The model was based on a 3DCNN-LSTM architecture, which suggests that the model was deployed on a platform capable of handling recurrent neural networks.

As for model serialization, the text does not provide specific details. However, it is common practice to save a trained model's architecture and weights to a file, which can then be loaded and used for making predictions. This process is often referred to as model serialization or checkpointing. The specific method used for model serialization in this study is not mentioned in the text.

In summary, while the text provides detailed information about the training process, it does not give specific details about the deployment or model serialization process. Therefore, the answer to the query is:

Answer:::
