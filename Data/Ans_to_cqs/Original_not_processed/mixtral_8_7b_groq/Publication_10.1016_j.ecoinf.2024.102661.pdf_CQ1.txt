Answer:::

The context provided does not directly answer the query regarding the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some sources of data used in specific studies.

In the study by Shi et al., 2023, they analyzed China's carbon emissions from 1997-2016. The data could have been collected from various sources such as government databases, energy reports, or environmental agencies. Similarly, Sui et al., 2024, focused on agricultural carbon emissions in China's main grain-producing areas. The data might have been sourced from agricultural censuses, satellite imagery, or weather databases.

In the context, machine learning and deep learning techniques are applied to these datasets after they have been collected and processed. The methods of data collection are not explicitly discussed, but it can be inferred that a combination of primary (surveys, sensors) and secondary data sources (public datasets, historical records) are used.

For instance, in the agricultural sector, sensors could be used to collect real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, and other factors that influence carbon emissions. Surveys could be conducted among farmers to gather information about their practices and the use of chemical fertilizers. Public datasets related to weather patterns, market prices, and government policies could also be used.

In the energy sector, smart meters and IoT devices could provide real-time data on energy consumption, which can be used to estimate carbon emissions. Public datasets related to energy production, transmission, and distribution can also be used.

Therefore, while the context does not provide a direct answer, it can be inferred that a variety of methods are used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, including surveys, sensors, and public datasets.
