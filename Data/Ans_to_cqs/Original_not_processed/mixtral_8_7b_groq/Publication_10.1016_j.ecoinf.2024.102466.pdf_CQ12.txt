Answer:::

The specific type of deep learning models used in the pipeline for object detection in camera trap images are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the models are based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) due to the use of certain model names that are built upon CNNs.

For instance, the context mentions models such as Faster RCNN, Cascade RCNN, RetinaNet, RepPoints, FCOS, Sparse RCNN, and ATSS. These models are all based on CNNs and are commonly used for object detection tasks. Furthermore, the context also mentions the ImageNet dataset, which is a large-scale image recognition dataset used for training CNNs.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning models used in the pipeline are based on CNNs.
