The provided context does not include information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text mentions the use of deep learning for herbarium species identification and the potential benefits of such a system, but it does not give any details about the code repository or where to find the implementation of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the code repository based on the given context.
