Based on the provided context, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model for species identification in camera trap data involves several steps, including model selection, training for specific species sets, and implementation on low power hardware. However, the text does not explicitly mention the steps of model serialization and platform selection. Here's a detailed explanation of the process based on the given context:

1. Model Selection: The text mentions that a suitable neural network was selected for species identification. However, it does not specify which model was chosen.

2. Training for Specific Species Sets: While the initial research focused on training the neural network for species identification, further research is needed to automate the process of training the network for user-selected or prevalent species in a region. This bespoke training is desirable to improve the robustness and reliability of the model for specific species sets.

3. Low Power Neural Networks in Hardware: To reduce power consumption and enable deployment in remote locations, the implementation of the deep learning model on low power hardware, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), is suggested. The context cites examples of successful implementations of Multilayer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Network models on FPGAs, achieving lower power consumption or higher performance compared to software-based approaches.

Based on this information, we can infer that the process of deploying the trained deep learning model involves the following steps:

- Selecting a suitable neural network architecture for species identification.
- Training the model on a specific set of species, using automated processes to improve robustness and reliability.
- Implementing the trained model on low power hardware, such as FPGAs, to reduce power consumption and enable deployment in remote locations.

However, the context does not explicitly mention the steps of model serialization (saving the trained model to a file) and platform selection (choosing the hardware or software environment for deployment). We can assume that these steps are part of the overall process, but the text does not provide enough information to answer the query definitively.
