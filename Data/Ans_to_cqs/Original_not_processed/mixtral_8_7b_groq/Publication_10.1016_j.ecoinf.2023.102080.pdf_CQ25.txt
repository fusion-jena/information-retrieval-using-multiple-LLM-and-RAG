Based on the provided context, there is no information suggesting that a deep learning model is being used in the covsel.embed() function or in the overall covsel (ver. 1.0.) framework. Instead, the model-specific embedding in Step B uses GLM with elastic-net regularization (GLM-EN) as the embedded selection procedure.

Answer:::
The purpose of the model-specific embedding in Step B of the covsel framework is to fit models with embedded selection procedures using the covariates selected in Step A. The embedded selection procedure used here is GLM with elastic-net regularization (GLM-EN), not a deep learning model such as classification, segmentation, or detection.
