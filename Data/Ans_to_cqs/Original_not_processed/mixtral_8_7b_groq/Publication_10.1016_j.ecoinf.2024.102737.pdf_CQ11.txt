Answer:::

 Based on the provided context, there is no direct link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the article "Improving deep learning based bluespotted ribbontail ray (Taeniura Lymma) recognition". The authors, Avivit Levy, Adi Barash, Chen Zaguri, Ariel Hadad, and Polina Polsky, do not mention any data repository link in their paper or in the CRediT authorship contribution statement.

 However, the paper mentions that they used the dataset from the LifeCLEF14 and LifeCLEF15 fish datasets for their experiments. These datasets are publicly available, and researchers can access them through the LifeCLEF website or the corresponding publications (Joly et al., 2014, 2015).

 Additionally, the authors used a pre-trained Siamese network for their experiments. They may have used a publicly available pre-trained model, but they do not specify the source of the pre-trained model in their paper.

 In summary, while the datasets used in the paper are publicly available, there is no direct link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the article. Researchers interested in replicating the study may need to access the datasets from the LifeCLEF website or the corresponding publications and use a pre-trained Siamese network for their experiments.
