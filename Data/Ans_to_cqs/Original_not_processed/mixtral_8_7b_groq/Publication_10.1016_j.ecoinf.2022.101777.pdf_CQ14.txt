Based on the provided context, there is no information given about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context includes an assessment that involves calculating the total number of training samples required for image classification using Eq. 1, and it provides information about the greatest improvement found for different simulations and seasonal data. However, it does not mention any methods used for hyperparameter optimization such as grid search, random search, or others. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
