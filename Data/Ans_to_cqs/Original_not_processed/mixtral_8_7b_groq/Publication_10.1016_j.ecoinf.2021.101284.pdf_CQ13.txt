Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information specific to the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model for COVID-19 cases. The sources cited focus on the relationship between air pollution and COVID-19, the course of COVID-19 cases, and the use of machine learning techniques for diagnosing COVID-19 based on medical images.

However, in general, deep learning models often have hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of layers, and number of neurons per layer. The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. Common optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam. The choice of optimizer and learning rate can significantly impact the model's performance.

In the context of diagnosing COVID-19 using medical images, Castillo (2020) mentions using a deep learning algorithm but does not provide details about the specific hyperparameters. In the context of air pollution and COVID-19, Dong et al. (2021) do not mention using deep learning models.

Therefore, without additional information, it is not possible to provide the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for COVID-19 cases.
