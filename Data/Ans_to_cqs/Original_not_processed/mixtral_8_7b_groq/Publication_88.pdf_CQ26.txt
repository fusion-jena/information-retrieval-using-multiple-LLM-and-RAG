Based on the provided context, there are no specific techniques mentioned regarding addressing data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does provide information about how the data is split and sampled.

In the Amazon database, the data is split into training, validation, and test sets. The training set consists of samples from tiles 1, 7, 9, and 13, while the validation set consists of samples from tiles 5 and 12. The test set consists of samples from tiles 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14, and 15. For the Cerrado database, the training set consists of samples from tiles 1, 2, 3, and 4. The validation set is not explicitly mentioned for the Cerrado database.

In terms of sampling, the context mentions balanced samples per class for both the Amazon and Cerrado databases. For the Amazon database, the balanced samples per class are 78,431 for the training set, 39,697 for the validation set, and 8118 for the test set. For the Cerrado database, the balanced samples per class are 16,236 for the training set and 5778 for the test set. However, the context does not explicitly mention any oversampling or undersampling techniques used to achieve these balanced samples.

Therefore, while the context does provide information about how the data is split and sampled, it does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
