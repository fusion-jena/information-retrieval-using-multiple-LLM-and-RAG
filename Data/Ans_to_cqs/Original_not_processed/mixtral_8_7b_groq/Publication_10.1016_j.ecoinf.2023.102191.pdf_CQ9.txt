Answer:

The provided context does not mention the data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is available. The article discusses a novel approach to data collection for biodiversity monitoring using a mobile app and post-dive interviews for recreational SCUBA divers. However, it does not specify the data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is stored or shared. The financial support for the research was provided by the Regional Agency for the Development of Research Technology and Innovation and the Foundation for Science and Technology. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data repository may be located in one of these organizations' repositories or a commonly used repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query.
