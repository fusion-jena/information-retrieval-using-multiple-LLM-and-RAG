Answer:::

In the context provided, there are two instances where preprocessing steps are mentioned before training deep learning models.

Firstly, in the development of D-Mask R-CNN for object detection and semantic segmentation of fauna and flora, the input channels (red, green, blue, and depth) are normalized. This normalization is performed by subtracting the respective mean and dividing by the respective standard deviation over the whole dataset. This step is crucial as it helps to reduce the difference in scales between the features, making it easier for the model to learn.

Secondly, when training a standard deep learning classifier (ResNet-50) on the cropped bounding box images of detected moths, the training dataset is augmented with additional images obtained from internet image search engines. However, since these images can come with noisy annotations, filtering different types of label noise is required. This can be seen as a form of data cleaning, which is a preprocessing step to improve the quality of the training data.

Therefore, the preprocessing steps involved before training deep learning models can include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Normalization and scaling are used to adjust the features to a similar scale, making it easier for the model to learn. Cleaning is used to improve the quality of the training data, especially when the initial training set has been rather small or when the data is noisy.
