Answer:::
The provided context does not include specific details about the preprocessing steps applied to the images before training the deep learning model. However, it is common practice in deep learning to perform several preprocessing steps on the data before training a model. These steps can include:

1. Normalization: This involves scaling the pixel values of the images to a range between 0 and 1. This is important because deep learning models are sensitive to the scale of the input features. By normalizing the data, we can ensure that all features are on a similar scale, which can improve the training process.
2. Data augmentation: This involves applying random transformations to the images, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping. This can help increase the size of the training set and reduce overfitting.
3. Noise reduction: This involves removing noise from the images, such as blurring or sharpening. This can help improve the quality of the data and make it easier for the model to learn.
4. Feature extraction: This involves extracting relevant features from the images, such as edges, corners, and textures. This can help reduce the dimensionality of the data and make it easier for the model to learn.

In the context provided, it is mentioned that the ResNext-101 model was used for the empty image recognition task. This model is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains over 1 million images from 1000 categories. Therefore, it is likely that the images used in this study were preprocessed in a similar way to the ImageNet dataset.

Additionally, the context mentions that the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a momentum value of Î¼ = 0.9 was used to train the model. This suggests that the data was not preprocessed using techniques such as mean subtraction or standard deviation division, as these techniques can affect the convergence of the optimizer.

Overall, while the provided context does not include specific details about the preprocessing steps applied to the images, it is likely that standard preprocessing techniques were used, such as normalization and data augmentation.
