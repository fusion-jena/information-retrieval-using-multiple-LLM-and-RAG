Answer:::

The pieces of context provided do not explicitly mention the deep learning framework used to build the model. However, they do give some clues. For instance, it is mentioned that a U-Net model was implemented within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python. ArcGIS API for Python is built on top of several popular libraries, including SciPy, NumPy, and Pandas, but it does not include TensorFlow or PyTorch, which are two of the most commonly used frameworks for deep learning.

Furthermore, it is mentioned that a different U-Net model was implemented using Keras, which can be used with TensorFlow. However, the context does not specify whether the same framework was used to implement the U-Net model within arcgis.learn.

In the section about the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) models, there is no mention of the framework used to build these models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to definitively answer which framework was used to build the deep learning model.
