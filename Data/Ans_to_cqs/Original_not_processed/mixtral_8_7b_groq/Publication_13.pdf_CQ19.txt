Answer:::
The text provided as context mentions the use of two specific deep learning libraries for building the models. These are TensorFlow and Keras. TensorFlow is a popular open-source library for machine learning and artificial intelligence developed by Google. Keras, on the other hand, is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.

According to the context, the specific version of TensorFlow used is 2.5.0. However, the version of Keras is not explicitly mentioned. Nonetheless, since Keras can run on top of TensorFlow, it can be inferred that a compatible version of Keras was used.

The text also mentions the use of a domain adaptation algorithm called domain adversarial training of neural networks (DANN). However, DANN is not a deep learning framework but a technique used for training deep learning models.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the deep learning models were built using TensorFlow and Keras libraries.
