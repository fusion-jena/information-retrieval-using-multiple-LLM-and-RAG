The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Sentinel-2 data in a study, which suggests the possibility of image data. Sentinel-2 is a European Space Agency (ESA) Earth observation mission that provides high-resolution optical imagery.

Moreover, the context also mentions the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data in biomass estimation methods. SAR data is a type of remote sensing data that can be used to create images, particularly in conditions where optical imaging is difficult (e.g., cloud cover, night-time).

In addition, the context refers to environmental variables, which could be represented in various formats such as CSV or other tabular formats.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that image data (from sources like Sentinel-2), SAR data, and tabular data (e.g., CSV) could be used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it is important to note that the specific data formats used would depend on the particular problem and dataset at hand.
