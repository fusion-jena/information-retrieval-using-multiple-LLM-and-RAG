The provided context does not contain information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context focuses on data quality, the FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability), and the use of the F-UJI tool to evaluate datasets' compliance with these principles.

The F-UJI tool is a continuously developing automatic testing tool for research data objects, based on the FAIR ecosystem. It assesses datasets according to various metrics, providing scores and debugging messages. However, the context does not mention specific criteria for training completion in machine learning models.

In summary, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
