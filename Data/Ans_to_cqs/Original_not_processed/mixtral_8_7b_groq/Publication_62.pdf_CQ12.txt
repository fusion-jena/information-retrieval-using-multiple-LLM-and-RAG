Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which includes tables and supplementary materials detailing the architecture of the model used in the study. Both the unstained/stained CNN and the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN consist of convolutional layers, batch normalization layers, and pooling layers, which are all characteristic components of a CNN. Furthermore, the authors explicitly mention the use of convolutional layers in their description of the model. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in this pipeline is a CNN.
