The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The articles mention the use of deep learning techniques for various applications such as NDVI reconstruction and wildfire event probability prediction, but they do not specify the hardware used for training the models.

However, it can be inferred that the training of deep learning models for remote sensing applications like NDVI reconstruction would require significant computational resources, and therefore, high-performance GPUs or TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) would be commonly used. These hardware resources can accelerate the training process and handle the large datasets and high-dimensional data typical in remote sensing applications.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models, it is reasonable to assume that high-performance GPUs or TPUs were used due to the large datasets and computational demands of deep learning in remote sensing applications.
