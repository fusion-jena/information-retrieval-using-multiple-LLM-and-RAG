Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline of the studies mentioned. However, it is mentioned that the images were resized, cropped, and normalized during data preparation. Resizing and cropping can be considered as forms of geometric data augmentation. Resizing changes the scale of the image, while cropping can be seen as a form of random cropping, a common data augmentation technique. Normalization of RGB values is a form of photometric data augmentation, which is used to change the intensity or color values of the image.

In general, data augmentation techniques in deep learning pipelines can include various methods such as:

1. Flipping: Horizontal or vertical flipping of the images, which helps to increase the dataset size and improve model performance by providing variations in the training data.
2. Rotation: Rotating the images by a certain angle, which helps the model to generalize better and be more robust to different orientations of objects in the images.
3. Scaling: Changing the scale of the images, which can help the model to learn features that are invariant to size.
4. Color jittering: Changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue of the images, which can help the model to learn features that are invariant to color and lighting conditions.
5. Random cropping: Cropping random sections of the images, which can help the model to learn features that are robust to occlusions and variations in the image boundaries.

These techniques can be applied individually or in combination, depending on the specific problem and dataset. Data augmentation is an essential step in deep learning pipelines, as it helps to increase the dataset size, reduce overfitting, and improve model generalization.
