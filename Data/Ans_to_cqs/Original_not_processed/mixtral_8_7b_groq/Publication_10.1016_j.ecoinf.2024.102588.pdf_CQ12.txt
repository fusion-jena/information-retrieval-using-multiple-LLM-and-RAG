Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of convolutional layers in the model and the application of the CNN model to estimate aquatic ecosystem health. Additionally, the update rule for the weights of the ith convolutional layer (wi,new) is given, which further confirms the use of a CNN model. The CNN model is chosen for this task because of its demonstrated outstanding performance in processing multidimensional data, such as water quality, hydraulic, and hydrological data. The CNN model is used in conjunction with an autoencoder, and the ensemble of these models is found to be a potential candidate for estimating aquatic ecosystem health indices compared with the original CNN and conventional machine learning models.
