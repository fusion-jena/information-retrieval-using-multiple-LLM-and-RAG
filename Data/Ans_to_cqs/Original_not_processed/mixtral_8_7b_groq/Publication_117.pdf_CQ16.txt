The text provided does not give specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that they used transfer learning with a pretrained general-purpose YOLO object detector as a starting point for training. They increased the weighting given to the no-object component of the multipart loss function and split each aerial image into 12 equal-sized tiles for training. The training was done using 15 different volunteers to count wildebeest in each image, and the overall project progress was displayed on a statistics bar on the home page. Once all images were retired, the classification data was downloaded. Prior to analysis, any count data made using early versions of the counting interface or collected by either developers or citizen scientists were filtered.

It can be inferred that they may have used a validation loss plateau or other convergence criteria to determine when training is complete, as this is a common practice in machine learning. However, the text does not explicitly state this.
