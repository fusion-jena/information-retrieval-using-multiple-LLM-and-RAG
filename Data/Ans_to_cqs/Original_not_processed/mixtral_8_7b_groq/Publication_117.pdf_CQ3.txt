Answer: The text provided does not give explicit details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the YOLO DCNN (You Only Look Once Deep Convolutional Neural Network) was used, which suggests the use of bounding box annotation. YOLO is a real-time object detection system that is known for its ability to identify objects in images using a single neural network. It does this by dividing the image into a grid and predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities for each cell in the grid.

The text also mentions that the images were tiled into subimages and passed through the YOLO DCNN. This could suggest the use of instance segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented from the background and other objects. However, the text does not explicitly confirm this.

In summary, while the text suggests the use of bounding box annotation, it does not provide clear evidence of the use of instance segmentation or other data annotation techniques.
