Answer:::
 The specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it does mention that the model was fine-tuned by unfreezing the entire model and training at a 10-fold lower learning rate (10âˆ’4). This implies that the initial learning rate used during the original training of the model was 10 times higher than the learning rate used in the fine-tuning stage. As for the optimizer, it was not specified in the context. The model was developed using the fastai library in Python, which supports various optimizers like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and Adadelta. Therefore, it can be inferred that one of these optimizers was used, but the specific one is not mentioned.
