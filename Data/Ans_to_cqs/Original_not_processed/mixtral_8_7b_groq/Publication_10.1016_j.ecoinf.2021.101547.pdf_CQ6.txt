Based on the provided context, it is not possible to explicitly list the preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the mini-batch size is user-adjustable and depends on the dataset. This implies that some form of preprocessing, such as normalization or scaling, may be necessary to ensure that the input data is compatible with the model's requirements.

In general, preprocessing steps for deep learning models can include:

1. Normalization: This involves scaling the input data to a range that is suitable for the model. For example, image data may be normalized to a range of [0,1] or [-1,1]. Normalization can help to improve the model's convergence and reduce training time.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling involves adjusting the range of the input data. However, scaling does not necessarily preserve the distribution of the data.

3. Cleaning: This involves removing or correcting any errors or inconsistencies in the data. For example, missing or invalid values may be replaced with imputed values.

4. Data augmentation: This involves artificially increasing the size of the dataset by applying transformations to the existing data. For example, image data may be rotated, flipped, or cropped to create new training examples.

5. Feature extraction: This involves selecting or engineering features that are relevant to the task at hand. For example, image data may be transformed into a different color space or reduced in dimensionality using principal component analysis (PCA).

It is important to note that the specific preprocessing steps required will depend on the nature of the dataset and the task at hand. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully consider the appropriate preprocessing steps for each individual use case.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly list the preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model, it is mentioned that the mini-batch size is user-adjustable, implying that some form of preprocessing may be necessary. In general, preprocessing steps for deep learning models can include normalization, scaling, cleaning, data augmentation, and feature extraction. The specific preprocessing steps required will depend on the nature of the dataset and the task at hand.
