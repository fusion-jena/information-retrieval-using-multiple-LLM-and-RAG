Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about a deep learning model being used. However, it does mention that the study involves data analysis of song variants or patterns of some unspecified species. Specifically, it describes a table of tracked vocalisations of each song structure as a proportion of the whole data set.

From this information, we can infer that the purpose of the data analysis might be related to the detection or segmentation of song patterns. The table breaks down the number of tracks, the percentage of tracking sample, and the percentage of detections for each song variant (P3, P2, P1, P3A, P2A, P3B). Additionally, it includes a row for alternating P3A to P3. This suggests that the researchers are interested in identifying and categorizing different song patterns and transitions between them.

However, without more information, it is impossible to definitively state the purpose of the deep learning model (assuming one is being used). It could be that the model is being used for classification of song patterns, segmentation of individual songs from continuous recordings, or even detection of specific vocalizations within songs. The context simply does not provide enough information to make a precise determination.

Answer::: The purpose of the deep learning model, as can be inferred from the provided context, seems to be related to the detection or segmentation of song patterns. However, without more information, it is not possible to state the exact purpose of the model.
