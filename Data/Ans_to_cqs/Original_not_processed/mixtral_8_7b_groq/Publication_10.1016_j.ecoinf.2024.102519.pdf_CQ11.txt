Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no specific deep learning pipeline data repository link given. However, the context does provide information about several data sources and repositories related to the study area of the Weihe River. These include the ASTER GDEM, Resource and Environment Science and Data Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, National Cryosphere Desert Data Center, National Catalog Service for Geographic Information, and statistical yearbooks from Gansu, Shaanxi, and Ningxia Provinces. The dataset names, data types, spatial resolutions, and data sources are also provided in a table. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a link to a repository for such a pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
