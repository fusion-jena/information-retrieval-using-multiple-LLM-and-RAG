Answer:::
The provided context does not specify the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions the use of the Random Forest classification method in the context of Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) changes in the Amazon forest. Therefore, I cannot provide information on whether a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, or any other deep learning model is used in this particular case.
