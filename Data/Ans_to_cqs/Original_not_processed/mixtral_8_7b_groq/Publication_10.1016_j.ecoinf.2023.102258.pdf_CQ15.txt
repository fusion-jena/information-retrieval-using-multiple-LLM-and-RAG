Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the description of various machine learning systems, methods, and baselines for few-shot sound event detection, without specifying the optimization techniques utilized in the deep learning models.

In general, deep learning models are optimized using various optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad. These optimization algorithms are used to minimize the loss function and update the model's parameters during training.

For instance, in the context, it is mentioned that long audio files are divided into shorter chunks to fit inside the limited memory of GPUs, and detections spanning these chunks are joined together in post-processing. This suggests that some form of mini-batch training is being used, which typically involves SGD or one of its variants.

However, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide an accurate and detailed answer to the query.
