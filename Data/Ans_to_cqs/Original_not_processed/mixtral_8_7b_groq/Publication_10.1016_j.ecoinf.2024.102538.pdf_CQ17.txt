The text provided gives some information about the training of a deep learning model, but it does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization as methods to prevent overfitting. However, it does mention the use of weight decay and a learning rate reduction strategy, which can be related to regularization techniques.

Weight decay is a form of L1/L2 regularization, where a penalty term is added to the loss function, which is proportional to the size of the model's weights. By adding this penalty, the model is encouraged to keep its weights small, which can help to prevent overfitting.

The learning rate reduction strategy mentioned in the text can also be seen as a form of regularization. By reducing the learning rate when the validation loss remains constant for a certain number of epochs, the model is effectively being prevented from making large updates to its weights. This can help to prevent overfitting, as it reduces the chance of the model fitting the noise in the training data.

It's also worth noting that the model was trained for 200 epochs, which is a relatively high number of iterations. Training for a large number of epochs can increase the risk of overfitting, so it's good to see that some regularization techniques were used to mitigate this risk.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization, it does mention the use of weight decay and a learning rate reduction strategy, which can be seen as forms of regularization. These techniques can help to prevent overfitting, which is an important consideration when training deep learning models.
