Answer:

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit description of a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention some post-training analysis methods that provide insights into the model's performance.

One such method is the calculation of precision, which is an index of the percentage of Region of Interest (ROI) correctly labeled by Kaleidoscope, the software used for detecting cow calls. This is estimated by dividing the number of cow calls detected by the software by the total number of ROIs within the “Cow” cluster. This gives an idea of how accurately the model is identifying cow vocalizations.

Additionally, the discussion mentions a comparison of the model's settings with those used by Karmiris et al. (2021). The authors opted for a larger FFT window size to improve the resolution at lower frequencies where cows vocalize. They also fitted cow-specific parameters in the model, which could explain why their model detected a much larger number of cow vocalizations compared to the study by Karmiris et al. These comparisons provide a way to understand the model's performance in the context of different parameter settings.

However, these are retrospective evaluations and do not directly speak to the monitoring of model performance during the training process. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to definitively answer the query about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
