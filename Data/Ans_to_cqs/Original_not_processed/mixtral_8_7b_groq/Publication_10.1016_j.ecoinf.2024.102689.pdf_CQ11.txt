Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. However, several papers use various datasets for training and testing their deep learning models for animal individual recognition.

For instance, Lahiri et al. (2011) used field photographs for biometric animal databases from wild zebras. Laplante et al. (2021) utilized underwater environments and audio data for fish recognition. Lei et al. (2022) and Zhang et al. (2021) used underwater target detection datasets and underwater fish individual recognition datasets, respectively. The high-resolution monitoring of fish length and catch numbers from landings using deep learning (Fish. Res. 246, 106166) likely has its dataset associated with the paper, although the direct link is not provided.

In the case of Ferreira et al. (2020), they developed a program that autonomously gathers training data, generates training datasets, and trains Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for small bird individual recognition. However, the specific data repository link for this study is not mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, while there is no direct data repository link for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context, several papers utilize different datasets for training and testing their deep learning models for animal individual recognition. To obtain the dataset links, it would be necessary to look up the specific papers and access the dataset information from there.
