Based on the provided context, there is no information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text discusses various databases and repositories used for storing and accessing biodiversity information, such as FishBase, GBIF, and OBIS. It also mentions the use of data curation and filtering techniques to enhance the quality of the data. However, it does not mention any details about the deployment of a deep learning model, including the platform used for deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
