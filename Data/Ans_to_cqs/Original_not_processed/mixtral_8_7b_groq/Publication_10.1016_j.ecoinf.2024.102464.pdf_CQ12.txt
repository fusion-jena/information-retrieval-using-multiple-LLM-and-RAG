Answer:::
The provided context does not specify the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers in the described pipeline. Instead, it mentions the use of seven machine learning models for species distribution modeling. These models include the Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART). The primary focus of the study is on ensemble modeling and landscape connectivity analysis for implementing the Incorporated Framework for Mapping Landscape Connectivity (IFM-LCONS). Therefore, I cannot identify a specific deep learning model used in this pipeline based on the given information.
