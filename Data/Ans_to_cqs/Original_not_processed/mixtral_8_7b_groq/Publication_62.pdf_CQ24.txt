Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline for the study in question. However, it is common practice in deep learning to use a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.

Randomness is inherent in deep learning due to the stochastic nature of processes such as weight initialization, data shuffling, and dropout. Using a fixed seed value ensures that the same sequence of random numbers is generated each time the model is trained, allowing for consistent results across multiple runs.

In the context of the study, the use of a fixed seed value might have been employed during the training of the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for handling randomness. Specifically, for the unstained/stained CNN and the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN, the Mathematica notebooks and annotated PDFs provided as supplementary materials may contain information about the seed value used for reproducibility.

It is also worth noting that techniques like dropout, which randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 during training, are used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Dropout introduces randomness during training, and a fixed seed value ensures consistent behavior across runs.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy used to handle randomness, it is common practice in deep learning to use a fixed random seed value for reproducibility. This practice might have been employed in the training of the CNNs used in the study.
