Answer:::
I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of deep learning models for sub-alpine shrub species identification and wetlands classification, as well as the superior performance of deep neural networks compared to human experts in certain tasks. However, it does not give any details about the code repository or where the implementation of the deep learning pipeline can be found.
