Answer:

The provided context does not directly mention the preprocessing steps for deep learning models. However, it does discuss data preprocessing in the context of data mining and knowledge discovery.

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, which includes data acquisition and processing (Hammad and AbouRizk, 2014; Kotu and Deshpande, 2015). This process precedes the application of data mining techniques and involves several steps, including data cleaning.

Data cleaning, also known as data cleansing or data scrubbing, is the process of identifying and correcting or removing errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in datasets (Lee and Siau, 2001). This step is essential for improving the quality of the data and the performance of data mining algorithms.

While the context does not explicitly mention normalization and scaling, these techniques are commonly used in data preprocessing for deep learning. Normalization is the process of rescaling numeric data to a common range, often between 0 and 1, to improve the model's convergence and prevent exploding or vanishing gradients (Kouadio et al., 2018). Scaling, on the other hand, involves resizing the features to have equal importance and prevent any feature from dominating the learning process (Kumar and Kanwar, 1997).

Therefore, based on the provided context and general practices in data preprocessing for deep learning, we can infer that data cleaning is an essential preprocessing step, and normalization and scaling are common techniques used in data preprocessing for deep learning models.
