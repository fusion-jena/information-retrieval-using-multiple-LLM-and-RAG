The provided context does not include information about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context focuses on the templates, identifiers, and data files used in a measurement system, including the E-Field Log template, Equipment Field Event Log, Measurement-specific Install, and Measurement-specific Details.

However, when training deep learning models, hardware resources like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are commonly used due to their ability to perform parallel computations, which significantly speeds up the training process compared to using a Central Processing Unit (CPU) alone.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information about the hardware resources used for training deep learning models. Typically, GPUs or TPUs are used for deep learning training, but this information is not specified in the context.
