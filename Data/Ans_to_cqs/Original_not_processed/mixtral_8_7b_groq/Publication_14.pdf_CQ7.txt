Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, it does mention that the "test dataset" was used for model evaluation, and it took 4 hours and 38 minutes on 30 CPUs with an average frame rate of 17 frames/s. It also mentions that the "new layers" were trained, but it does not specify if this was done using a separate validation set or how the data was split for training and validation.

Additionally, the text states that "For training the fine-tuned neural network, I collected images for each class and trained with a batch size of 100 for 20,000 steps." This suggests that the data was split in some way for training, but it does not specify how.

In general, for deep learning model training, it is common to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and test. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and make decisions during the training process, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

The text does not provide enough information to determine if this approach was used or what the specific criteria were for splitting the data.
