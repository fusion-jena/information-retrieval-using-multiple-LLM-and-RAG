Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, some information about the model and the training process can be inferred.

The deep learning model is based on a pre-trained hummingbird model, which is a fine-tuned neural network. The authors collected images for each class and trained the new layers with a batch size of 100 for 20,000 steps. They used Google Cloud DataFlow to extract the feature vectors for the frozen layers in parallel, which were then used to retrain the new fine-tuned layers.

The authors mention that they used a single CPU for training the new layers, which took 27 minutes. However, they do not provide information about the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters used during training.

The authors also evaluated the model on a test dataset of 70 videos, which took 4 hours and 38 minutes on 30 CPUs with an average frame rate of 17 frames per second. Again, they do not provide any information about the evaluation metrics used or any hyperparameters related to the evaluation process.

Therefore, while some information about the training process is provided, the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not explicitly stated in the given text.
