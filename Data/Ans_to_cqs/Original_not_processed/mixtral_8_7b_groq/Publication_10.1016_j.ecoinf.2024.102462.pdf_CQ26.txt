Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of "data augmentation" as a technique to mitigate issues related to data bias in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does not explicitly mention other preprocessing techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

Data augmentation is a technique that involves creating new synthetic data points by applying transformations to the existing data while preserving the class labels. This technique is used to increase the size of the underrepresented classes and balance the data, thereby reducing the bias towards larger classes. The context suggests that data augmentation led to an increase in overall accuracy and significant improvements in the metrics for smaller classes.

Stratified sampling, oversampling, and undersampling are other techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Stratified sampling involves dividing the data into subgroups or strata based on the class labels and then randomly sampling from each stratum to ensure that each subset is proportionally represented in the training and testing sets. Oversampling involves increasing the size of the underrepresented classes by replicating existing data points, while undersampling involves reducing the size of the overrepresented classes by randomly selecting a subset of data points. These techniques can help balance the data and reduce bias but can also lead to overfitting or loss of information.

Diverse data collection is another approach to reducing data bias by collecting data from multiple sources, domains, or populations. This technique can help ensure that the data is representative of the problem and reduce the risk of bias towards specific subgroups or classes.

In summary, the provided context discusses the use of data augmentation as a technique to address data bias during preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline. Other techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are not explicitly mentioned in the context but are commonly used to reduce bias and improve the quality of the data.
