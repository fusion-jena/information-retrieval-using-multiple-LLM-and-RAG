Answer:::
The context provided does not explicitly mention the deep learning frameworks used to build the models. However, it is highly likely that popular frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch were used, as they are widely used in the machine learning community and support the mentioned models. For instance, the EfficientNet models were primarily developed and trained using TensorFlow, as mentioned in the original paper by Tan and Le (2019). Similarly, InceptionResNetv2 and ResNet50v2 are commonly implemented using TensorFlow or PyTorch. It is also possible that other frameworks such as Keras, Theano, or Caffe were used, but these are less common for the mentioned models.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on the deep learning frameworks used, it is highly likely that TensorFlow or PyTorch were used, given the popularity and support for the mentioned models in these frameworks.
