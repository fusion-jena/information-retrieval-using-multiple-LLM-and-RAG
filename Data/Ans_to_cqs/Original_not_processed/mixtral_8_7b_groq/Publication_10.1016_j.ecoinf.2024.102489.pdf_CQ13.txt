I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the Random Forest (RF) model and its hyperparameters. The RF model hyperparameters mentioned are:

1. n_estimators: The number of trees in the forest, which was varied from 100 to 1000 in increments of 50.
2. minleaf: The minimum number of leaves in each decision tree, which could take on values of 2, 5, 10, 20, or 50.
3. max_features: The number of randomly selected node-split feature variables, which was set to 1 or k (the number of characteristic variables).

As for the deep learning model, the context does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used. It mentions a study by Jamali et al. (2023) that used deep neural networks for estimating leaf parameters, but it does not give details about the hyperparameters of their deep learning model.
