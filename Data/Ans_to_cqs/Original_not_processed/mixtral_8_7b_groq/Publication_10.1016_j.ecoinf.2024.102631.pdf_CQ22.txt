The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of typical evaluation metrics for deep learning models such as accuracy, precision, or recall. Instead, it discusses the use of three non-reference metrics for evaluating the performance of the model: UCIQE, UIQM, and NIQE.

UCIQE (Unsupervised Color Image Quality Evaluation) and UIQM (Unsupervised Image Quality Metric) measure the level of human visual perception in the results, with higher scores indicating better performance. NIQE (Naturalness Image Quality Evaluator), on the other hand, measures the perceptual quality of the image, with lower scores indicating better performance.

These metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance on the C-60 challenge dataset, which does not contain reference images. The model achieved the highest UIQM score of 3.12 and the highest UCIQE score of 0.591, indicating that it performs well in terms of human visual perception and image quality.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the model's performance is evaluated using UCIQE, UIQM, and NIQE metrics, rather than typical deep learning evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall.
