Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the authors use a method called segmentation pre-training to improve the training results of their network. This method involves training the network on larger datasets first, followed by fine-tuning the network on the target task. The authors also use a ResNet50 model in conjunction with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to increase the network output resolution.

Moreover, the authors have shown that training a network for classification only can lead to the network focusing on a small number of discriminative parts of the plants instead of all visible parts. This can be detrimental in plant cover prediction, where only the leaves of the plants are visible, while the network focuses on the blossoms of the plants during pre-training. Therefore, it can be inferred that the authors monitor the model performance during training by evaluating the network's ability to predict plant cover accurately.

Additionally, the authors use the AdamW optimizer during all three phases of training, which suggests that they may be monitoring the model performance by tracking the optimization process and adjusting the learning rate accordingly. However, the context does not provide explicit information on the specific monitoring strategy used.
