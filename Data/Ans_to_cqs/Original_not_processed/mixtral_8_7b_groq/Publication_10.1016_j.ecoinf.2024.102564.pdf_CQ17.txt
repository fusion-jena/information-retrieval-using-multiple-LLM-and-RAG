Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline for the mentioned studies. The studies mainly focus on the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forests (RF) in ecological modeling and forest management, but they do not explicitly mention the use of regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization.

However, it is important to note that regularization methods are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. Dropout is a regularization technique used in neural networks where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent over-dependence on any single neuron and reduces overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2014). L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the weights, which encourages smaller weights and reduces overfitting (Ng, 2004).

Therefore, while the specific regularization methods used in the studies mentioned in the context are not provided, it is reasonable to assume that regularization techniques were used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
