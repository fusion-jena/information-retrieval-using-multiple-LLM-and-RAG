Answer:::
Deep learning models, in contrast to the XGBoost algorithm used in the study for Fv/Fm parameter estimation, typically utilize various optimization techniques to converge on optimal solutions during training. These techniques are employed to update the parameters of the model based on the error calculated from the difference between predicted and actual values.

Two popular optimization techniques used in deep learning are Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple yet effective optimization technique used in deep learning. It updates the model parameters by computing the gradient of the loss function concerning each training example, rather than the entire dataset. This approach allows SGD to be computationally efficient and effective for large datasets. However, SGD may not always converge to the optimal solution due to its simplicity and reliance on the learning rate, which needs to be carefully tuned.

Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is a more sophisticated optimization technique that combines the advantages of SGD with momentum and adaptive learning rate methods. Adam estimates the first and second moments of the gradient to adapt the learning rate for each parameter. This adaptability allows Adam to converge faster and more reliably than SGD in many scenarios. Additionally, Adam often requires less fine-tuning of the learning rate compared to SGD.

These optimization techniques, along with others, are commonly applied in deep learning pipelines to facilitate model training and improve convergence. The choice of optimization technique depends on the specific problem, dataset, and computational resources available.
