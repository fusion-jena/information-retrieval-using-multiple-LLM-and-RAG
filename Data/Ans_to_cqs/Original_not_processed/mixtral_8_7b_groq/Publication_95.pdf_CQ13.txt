Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, as described in the provided context, include the learning rate, optimizer, and batch size. The learning rate is set to 0.001, and the optimizer used is the Adam optimizer. The batch size varies from 1 to 32 images, depending on the input image resolution, with larger batch sizes for smaller image sizes. Additionally, the training set is balanced by upsampling the images from the underrepresented classes through repetition to match the number of images of the most represented class, "No species." These hyperparameters were used when training the ResNet50V2 models for 100 epochs, with the model that achieved the highest accuracy on the validation set during training being saved for further analysis.
