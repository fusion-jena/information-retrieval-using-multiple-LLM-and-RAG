Answer:::
The specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the provided context are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that the model's prediction accuracy on the testing set has improved by about 20% after embedding LSTM into the CNN. This implies that the accuracy metric was used in this particular study.

In general, when evaluating the performance of a deep learning model, several metrics can be used, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made. Precision calculates the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions. Recall, on the other hand, measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced assessment of both measures.

In the context of drought assessment and prediction, other evaluation metrics could include:

1. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): This metric measures the difference between predicted and actual values, taking into account both the magnitude and direction of the errors.

2. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Similar to RMSE, MAE measures the average magnitude of errors but does not consider their direction.

3. Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²): This metric indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be explained by the independent variables.

4. Explained Variance Score: This metric measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the model.

Without explicit information on the evaluation metrics used in the provided context, it can be inferred that accuracy was used. However, for a comprehensive evaluation of a deep learning model in drought assessment and prediction, it is recommended to use a combination of these metrics.
