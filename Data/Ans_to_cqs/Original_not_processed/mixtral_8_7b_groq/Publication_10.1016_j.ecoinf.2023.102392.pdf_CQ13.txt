Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (eXtreme Gradient Boosting or XGBoost) for forest type classification. However, it does mention that deep learning models, including XGBoost, have been used for object recognition and categorization in various studies.

In general, hyperparameters in deep learning models are values that are set before training the model and can significantly impact the model's performance. Some common hyperparameters for deep learning models include:

1. Learning rate: This determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function.
2. Optimizer: This is an algorithm used to update the weights and biases of the model during training. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.
3. Number of hidden layers and nodes: These determine the complexity of the model.
4. Regularization parameters: These help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function.

For the XGBoost model specifically, some additional hyperparameters include:

1. Maximum depth of trees
2. Subsample ratio of the training instances
3. Subsample ratio of the features
4. Minimum child weight
5. Gamma

The authors of the provided context may have used some or all of these hyperparameters in their XGBoost model for forest type classification. However, without access to the original study or code, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
