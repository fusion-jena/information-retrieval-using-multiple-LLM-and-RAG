Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context focuses on the discussion of a study related to the drivers of per capita Crop Evapotranspiration (CEFs) and the use of multi-scale data and various models in the field of agro-land ecology.

However, it is common practice in model training and evaluation to calculate various metrics and create visualizations like confusion matrices or saliency maps to assess the performance of the model. These steps help in understanding how well the model is performing and identifying any potential issues or biases.

Metrics calculation usually includes measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), among others. These metrics provide a quantitative assessment of the model's performance.

Confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It summarizes the number of false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives, which can be used to calculate various metrics mentioned earlier.

Saliency maps are a way to visualize the importance of input features for a model's prediction. They highlight the parts of the input that the model finds most relevant for its decision-making process.

In the given context, Table 6 presents the results of a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis, which includes various fit indices. These fit indices evaluate the overall model fit and the relationships between the variables in the model. However, they do not directly correspond to the postprocessing steps mentioned in the query.
