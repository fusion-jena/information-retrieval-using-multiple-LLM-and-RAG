Answer:::
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions the dataset used, which is the WSGD dataset, but it does not specify where this dataset can be accessed or where the deep learning pipeline results have been deposited. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
