Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models mentioned in the context are as follows:

1. No-overfitting model: The optimization algorithm used for this model is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.0001 and a weight decay of 0.5. The batch size is set to 32, the number of training epochs to 200. Additionally, batch-norm and dropout with a probability of 0.5 are used to reduce overfitting.

2. Overfitting model: This model also uses SGD as the optimization algorithm, but with a learning rate of 0.001. The batch size is set to 32, and a momentum of 0.9 is applied. A decay of 0.5 is applied every 512 iterations, summing up to a total of 2048 iterations. In contrast to the no-overfitting model, this model does not use batch-norm, weight decay, or dropout techniques to ensure overfitting.

3. Siamese Neural Network (SNN) and Ensemble MIA models: The context does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in these models. However, it can be inferred that both models use some form of SGD as the optimizer since it is a common optimizer used in deep learning.

In summary, the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models mentioned in the context include learning rate, batch size, number of training epochs, optimizer, weight decay, dropout, batch-norm, and momentum. The specific values of these hyperparameters vary depending on the model and the training objective.
