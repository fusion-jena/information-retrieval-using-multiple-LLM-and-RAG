I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the necessary information to determine the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context includes references to the use of deep learning in ecological informatics and biodiversity modeling, as well as the use of unmanned aircraft systems and bioacoustic recorders in wildlife research. However, it does not mention any specific data repository or pipeline related to deep learning. I recommend checking the original research articles or contacting the authors directly for more detailed information.
