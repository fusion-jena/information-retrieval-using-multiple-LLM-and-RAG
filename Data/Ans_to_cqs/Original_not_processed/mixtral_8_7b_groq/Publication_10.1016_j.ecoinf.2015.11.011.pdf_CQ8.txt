Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about a code repository for a deep learning pipeline. The text describes a study that used various geospatial data and tools to analyze site characteristics and changes over time. However, it does not mention any deep learning techniques or code repositories. The tools used in the study include eCognition rulesets, Leica Photogrammetry Suite, and a kmz file, but none of these are related to deep learning or code repositories. Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline.
