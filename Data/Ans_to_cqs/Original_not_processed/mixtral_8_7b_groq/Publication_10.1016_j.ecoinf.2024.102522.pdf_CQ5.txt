Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, there are several datasets mentioned that are related to remote sensing and geographical information systems.

The first dataset is based on nighttime light images for the Taihu Lake Basin, which is used in a study on population simulation (Guo, 2019). The dataset is likely composed of images captured by satellites or other remote sensing technologies, and is used to estimate population distribution in the region.

The second dataset is the MODIS 500 Meter Global Vegetationcontinuous Field Products, which is used in a study on the impact of climate change on vegetation (Hansen et al., 2015). This dataset provides information on vegetation coverage and biomass, and is used to analyze changes in these variables over time.

The third dataset is based on nighttime light and land use and cover (LUC) data in the Sichuan-Chongqing Region (Hu et al., 2018). This dataset is used to analyze the spatial distribution of population and its relationship with land use and cover.

The fourth dataset is a collection of nighttime light remote sensing data, which is used in an overview of data mining techniques for this type of data (Li and Li, 2015). The dataset is likely composed of images captured by satellites or other remote sensing technologies, and is used to demonstrate various data mining techniques.

The fifth dataset is a collection of nighttime light imagery for Zimbabwe, which is used to analyze the country's economic decline over a decade (Li et al., 2013). The dataset is used to identify changes in economic activity and development over time.

The sixth dataset is a collection of Luojia no.1 nightlight data for Guangzhou, which is used to map construction land in the city (Li et al., 2019). The dataset is used to analyze changes in land use and development over time.

In summary, while there is no information about the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, there are several datasets mentioned that are related to remote sensing and geographical information systems. These datasets are used to analyze various aspects of geographical data, such as population distribution, vegetation coverage, land use and cover, and economic activity.
