The platform used to deploy the deep learning model in the study to understand the invasion of Spartina alterniflora in the cloudy coastal zone is Google Earth Engine (GEE). The authors mention that GEE provides an ideal platform for handling the massive amount of data required by the pixel-based method (i.e. Ppf-CM) with its powerful data storage and high computational capacity. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was developed and deployed on the Google Earth Engine platform.
