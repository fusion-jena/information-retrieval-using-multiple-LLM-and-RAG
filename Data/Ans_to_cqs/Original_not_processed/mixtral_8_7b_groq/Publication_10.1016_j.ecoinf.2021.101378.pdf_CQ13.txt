Answer:::
I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not mention or discuss the use of a deep learning model for ecological informatics or insect forest risk assessment. The context focuses on the use of machine learning models, specifically artificial neural networks, random forest (RF), and maximum entropy modeling (Maxent), for species distribution studies and insect forest risk assessment.

In the context, the RF and Maxent models are discussed in detail, including their effectiveness and performance in predicting species distribution. However, there is no mention of the hyperparameters used in these models. Hyperparameters are internal parameters that control the learning process in a model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer in a deep learning model.

In summary, based on the provided context, I cannot provide information on the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model for ecological informatics or insect forest risk assessment, as the context does not discuss the use of deep learning models.
