Answer:::

The performance of the deep learning model, referred to as Kaleidoscope, is evaluated using two metrics: precision and recall. Precision is calculated by dividing the number of cow calls detected by the software by the total number of ROIs (Region of Interest) within the “Cow” cluster. This gives an index of the percentage of ROIs that have been correctly labeled by Kaleidoscope. On the other hand, recall is estimated by dividing the number of cow calls detected by Kaleidoscope by the number of cow calls present in the sound recordings. This is interpreted as an index of the percentage of calls that the recognizer is able to detect.

In a related study using Red Deer as a study species, recall rates of approximately 90% were obtained for five supervised machine learning algorithms, suggesting that the creation of sophisticated models could significantly improve the detection of ungulate vocalization.

It is important to note that the number of cow calls in sound recordings was estimated by an experienced observer who visually and acoustically checked 200 selected recordings. This was done to remove false positives and ensure the accuracy of the estimates.

In summary, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using precision and recall. Precision measures the proportion of correctly labeled ROIs, while recall measures the percentage of calls detected by the recognizer. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to accurately identify and detect cow calls in sound recordings.
