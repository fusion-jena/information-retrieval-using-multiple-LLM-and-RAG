Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific details about how the raw data was collected for the deep learning pipeline in question. It only mentions that the study used a dataset containing spectrograms and metadata of 22 species from 28 different countries. However, it does provide some insights into the types of data that are commonly used in deep learning applications.

Deep learning has been increasingly used in various fields such as bioinformatics and medicine to process large and complex datasets. These datasets can come from different sources, such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets. For instance, in the context of audio data, researchers might collect audio recordings using microphones or other recording devices. These recordings can then be processed to extract features such as spectrograms, which can be used as input to a deep learning model.

In the case of the study described in the context, the raw data consists of audio recordings of 22 species from different countries. The metadata associated with each recording includes information about the country where the recording was made. This metadata is encoded as a one-hot vector and used as input to a separate branch of the deep learning model.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific details about how the raw data was collected, it is mentioned that the dataset contains audio recordings and metadata. In general, deep learning models can use various types of data, including audio, visual, and other sensor data, which can be collected through surveys, sensors, or public datasets.
