The provided context does not give information about the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline for fire risk maps in fire-sensitive forest ecosystems. However, it does offer insights into the methods and data used to create these fire risk maps.

First, the context highlights the importance of high spatial resolution remote sensing data, particularly Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images with multispectral bands. While no specific datasets are mentioned, it is clear that the authors value high-resolution, multiband data for accurate fire risk mapping.

Additionally, the context refers to the use of Landsat 8 satellite images for fire risk mapping. Table 1 provides details about the Landsat 8 OLI sensor, including the path/row, acquisition date, cloud cover, band name, central wavelength, and spatial resolution. This information suggests that the authors used Landsat 8 satellite images as part of their dataset.

The context also reveals that the authors performed atmospheric correction on the images using QGIS and calculated various vegetation indices, such as NBR, NBRT, NDVI, and NDWI. These vegetation indices were likely used as features in their machine learning models.

Speaking of machine learning models, the context cites a study by Nguyen et al. (2018) that employed three distinct machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, and Random Forests. However, it does not explicitly state whether these algorithms were used in the deep learning pipeline for fire risk mapping.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for fire risk maps, it does offer valuable information about the methods and data used in the process. The authors likely used Landsat 8 satellite images, calculated vegetation indices, and employed machine learning algorithms for their fire risk mapping. However, the specific deep learning datasets remain unknown based on the given information.
