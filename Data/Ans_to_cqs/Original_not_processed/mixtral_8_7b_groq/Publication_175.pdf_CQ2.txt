Answer:::

The text provided as context focuses on the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically ResNet 100, for image classification tasks, particularly in the context of few-shot learning (FSL) for coral reef fish species identification. Therefore, the primary data format discussed is images.

The CNNs used in this context are trained on image datasets, which consist of pairs of labels and images. These images are likely in a format such as JPEG or PNG, which are commonly used for storing and transmitting image data. The labels associated with each image would typically be stored in a text-based format, such as a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file, where each row represents an image and contains the corresponding label.

While the context does not explicitly mention other data formats like audio or video, it does reference a paper titled "Neural Networks Audio-based Bird Species Identification With Deep Convolutional Neural Networks," indicating that CNNs can also be used for audio-based tasks. In such cases, the data format would be audio files, such as WAV or MP3. For video data, the format could be something like MP4 or AVI, and the CNN would likely be modified to handle the temporal dimension of video data.

In summary, while the primary data format discussed in the provided context is images, CNNs can also handle audio and video data. The specific data format used would depend on the nature of the task and the type of data being processed.
