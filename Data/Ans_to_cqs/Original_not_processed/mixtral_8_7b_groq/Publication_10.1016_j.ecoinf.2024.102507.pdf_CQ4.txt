Answer:::
The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include rotation, flipping, and zooming. These techniques were performed using Rasterio to enhance the robustness of the model. Data augmentation is a critical step in the pipeline, as it helps to increase the size of the training dataset and reduce overfitting by creating modified versions of the original images.

In the context provided, the original image tiles were augmented through these specific techniques, contributing to the successful classification results observed in certain data formats and band configurations. For instance, the '72band_256_16bit_split' simulation result was achieved through the utilization of data augmentation and flattened convolution kernels.

However, the text does not explicitly mention other data augmentation techniques such as scaling, brightness adjustments, or adding noise. It is possible that these techniques were not used in this particular study, or they might have been incorporated into the 'rotation', 'flipping', and 'zooming' categories. Nonetheless, the provided context demonstrates the importance of data augmentation in the deep learning pipeline and the impact it can have on the final classification accuracy.
