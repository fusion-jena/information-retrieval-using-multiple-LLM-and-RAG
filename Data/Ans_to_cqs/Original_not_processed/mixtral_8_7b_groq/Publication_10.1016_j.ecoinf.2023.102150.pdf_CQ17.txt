Answer:::

The provided context discusses a deep learning pipeline for image classification of small mammals and birds, but it does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. However, based on the general practices in deep learning, we can infer some possible regularization techniques that might have been used.

One common regularization method is dropout, which randomly sets a fraction of the input units to zero during training, preventing over-reliance on any single neuron and promoting the development of redundant representations. Dropout has been shown to improve the performance of neural networks in various applications, including image classification.

Another regularization technique is L2 regularization, which adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, reducing the capacity of the model and preventing overfitting.

Data augmentation, which is mentioned in the context, can also be seen as a form of regularization. By creating new training examples through transformations such as shifts, flips, rotations, zooms, and shears, the model is forced to learn more general features that are invariant to these transformations.

Finally, the choice of the optimization algorithm can also affect the model's tendency to overfit. For example, the Adam optimizer, which is mentioned in the context, uses an adaptive learning rate that can help the model converge faster and avoid overfitting.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used, it is likely that a combination of dropout, L2 regularization, data augmentation, and careful choice of optimization algorithm were used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
