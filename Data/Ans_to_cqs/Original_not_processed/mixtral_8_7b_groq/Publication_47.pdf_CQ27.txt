Answer:::

The trained deep learning model, IUC-NN, was implemented as an R package and built on the Python TensorFlow library. The model was deployed following a series of steps, including training, validation, and testing.

First, the data set was randomly split into a training set (90% of the entries) and a test set (10%). Then, 20% of the training set was used for validation. Cross-validation was performed by shifting the validation set 5 times to quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy. The neural network with the lowest cross-entropy loss was selected from a range of models with different numbers of hidden layers and subsets of features.

The IUC-NN model was then used to predict the conservation status of all orchid species at two levels: binary (possibly threatened vs. not threatened) and detailed (CR, EN, VU, NT, and LC). The model's predictions were based on four groups of features, derivable from digitally available occurrence records: geographic, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic.

The IUC-NN model was deployed as an R package, making it easily accessible for use. However, the context does not provide information on model serialization or platform selection. Model serialization typically involves saving the model's architecture and weights to a file, allowing it to be easily loaded and used for predictions. Platform selection refers to choosing the hardware and software environment where the model will be deployed.

The developers suggest that including data on species trade, land use, or life history, once they are available, may help increase the accuracy of IUC-NN and overcome dependency on threat category. Additionally, future developments of IUC-NN will quantify the estimation of threat as a continuous parameter to increase the accuracy for intermediate threat levels and will implement Bayesian neural networks to quantify uncertainties in the prediction.

In conclusion, while the context provides information on the training, validation, and testing of the IUC-NN model, it does not provide specific details on model serialization or platform selection. However, the model was deployed as an R package, making it accessible for use.
