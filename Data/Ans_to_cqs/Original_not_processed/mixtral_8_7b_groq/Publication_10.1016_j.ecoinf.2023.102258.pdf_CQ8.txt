Based on the provided context, there is no information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline being available on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The text focuses on discussing the challenges and methods in the application of deep learning for bioacoustic events, comparing various baselines and systems submitted to a public challenge. However, it does not mention any details about the code repository or where to access the implemented pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
