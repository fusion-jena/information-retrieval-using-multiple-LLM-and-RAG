Answer:::

Based on the information provided, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository in the context. The references are related to carbon sources and sinks, stomatal sensitivity, and flux tower data. The CRediT authorship contribution statement lists the authors' contributions, but it does not mention any deep learning pipeline or code repository. The data availability statement only mentions the flux tower data availability with Dr. Sandipan Mukherjee and the competent authorities of G.B. Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment, Almora, Uttarakhand, India.

Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
