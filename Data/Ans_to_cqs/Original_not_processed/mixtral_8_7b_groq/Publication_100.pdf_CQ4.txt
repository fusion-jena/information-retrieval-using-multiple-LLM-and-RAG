Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does mention that for each iteration of training, a batch of 64 reference data patches is randomly sampled. These patches are of size 15 x 15 pixels and are only considered for training if the center pixel is forested. For every reference data patch, a random optical image from the correct year and two SAR images (one ascending and one descending orbit) with acquisition dates near the one of the optical image are picked. This random selection of images associated with each reference data patch can be considered a form of data augmentation as it introduces variability in the input data. However, traditional data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are not mentioned.
