The provided context discusses methods to address data bias in the context of species distribution models, particularly in the presence of sampling bias and data scarcity. While the text does not explicitly mention techniques used in deep learning preprocessing such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling, it does describe a method that involves transforming model input data using four approaches to achieve equal bias.

These four approaches are categorized based on two criteria: the dataset concerned with the transformation (presence sites or background sites), and the implementation spaces of the transformation (geographical or environmental space). When the presence dataset is considered, the goal is to modify its distribution to tend toward a uniform distribution, and the background set is obtained via a uniform random selection. The implementation space of such an approach can be either the geographical space or environmental feature space.

Another technique mentioned is the construction of a background set according to a selection bias that reflects the same sampling bias. This method is used when the background set is considered.

The text also discusses the use of three indexes to quantify the relative impact of the bias correction methods on model performances. These indexes are AUC, Denv, and Dgeo, and they are computed using equations that compare the evaluation of the unbiased model output with the biased model output.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling, it does describe methods for transforming model input data and constructing a background set to address data bias in the context of species distribution models.
