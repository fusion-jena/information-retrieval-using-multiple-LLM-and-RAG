Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context only mentions that a new data set was created for the project due to the lack of existing quality data, but it does not specify where this data set is stored or made available for others to access. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific repository where the data can be found.
