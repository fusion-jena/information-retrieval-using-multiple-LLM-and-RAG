Answer:::
The deep learning model in question was trained using NVIDIA Titan Xp Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Specifically, the model was initially trained on a single GPU for 9000 iterations using a subset of 498 images. Subsequently, it was trained on three GPUs for 18000 iterations using the full dataset of 653 annotated images. The use of GPUs, which are specialized hardware for handling computations related to graphics and image processing, significantly accelerates the training process of deep learning models by parallelizing computations. However, the text does not mention the use of Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which are custom-built chips developed by Google for handling machine learning tasks.
