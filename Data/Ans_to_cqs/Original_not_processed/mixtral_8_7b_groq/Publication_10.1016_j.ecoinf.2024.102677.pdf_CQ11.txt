Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no direct link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the study. However, the study does provide the sources for the datasets used in the pipeline. These sources are:

1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data can be found at <https://www.resdc.cn/>
2. Nighttime Light (NTL) data can be found at <http://www.tdc.ac.cn/>
3. Net Primary Productivity (NPP) data can be found at <https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/>

It is possible that the deep learning pipeline used in the study is not publicly available or was not shared through a data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. If you are interested in accessing the pipeline, I would recommend reaching out to the authors of the study for more information.
