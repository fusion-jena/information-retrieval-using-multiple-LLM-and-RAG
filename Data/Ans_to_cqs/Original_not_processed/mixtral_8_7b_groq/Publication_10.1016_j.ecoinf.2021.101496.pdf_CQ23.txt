Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the artificial neural network (ANN) was fitted using the Keras package in Python 3.8 and that 100 successful runs were performed to analyze the model residuals for a more reliable evaluation of the model performance. This suggests that some steps were taken to assess the reliability and robustness of the ANN. Additionally, the context states that the mean absolute difference of the predicted value from the measured value was used as the main measure for the convenience of model fit, which indicates that some form of error or deviation was calculated to evaluate the model's accuracy. However, without more information, it is difficult to definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
