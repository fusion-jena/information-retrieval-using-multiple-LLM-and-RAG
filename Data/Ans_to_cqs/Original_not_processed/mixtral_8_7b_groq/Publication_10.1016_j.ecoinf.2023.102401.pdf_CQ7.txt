Answer:::

In the context provided, the criteria for splitting the data into training and testing sets vary for each dataset used to evaluate the performance of the YWnet model.

For the dataset containing 638 images divided into seven categories, 510 images are used for training, and 128 images are used for testing. This represents a split of approximately 76.7% for training and 23.3% for testing.

The trash-ICRA19 dataset, which includes 1144 images across three categories, has 915 images for training and 229 images for testing. This results in a training set that is about 80% of the total dataset and a testing set that is roughly 20%.

The VisDrone dataset, a part of the Tiny Target Dataset, consists of 1610 images categorized into 12 classes. The training set includes 1288 images, while the test set contains 332 images. This results in a training set that is approximately 80% of the total dataset and a testing set that is about 20%.

The NWPU VHR-10 dataset has 800 images with ten categories. The training and test sets consist of 640 and 160 images, respectively. This represents a training set that is 80% of the total dataset and a testing set that is 20%.

Lastly, the HRSID dataset contains 5604 images in one category. The training and test sets comprise 4483 and 1121 images, respectively. This results in a training set that is about 80% of the total dataset and a testing set that is approximately 20%.

In summary, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in the provided context typically involve using around 80% of the dataset for training and the remaining 20% for testing. However, the exact percentage may vary slightly depending on the dataset.
