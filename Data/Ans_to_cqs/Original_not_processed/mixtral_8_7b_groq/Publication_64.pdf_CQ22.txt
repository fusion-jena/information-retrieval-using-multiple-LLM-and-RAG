Answer:::
The two metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the given context are top1 accuracy and top5 accuracy. The top1 accuracy measures how often the correct label is the highest probability label predicted by the ResNet50 model, while the top5 accuracy measures how often the correct label is among the five labels with the highest probability. These metrics are used consistently across all three datasets to compare the performance of the ResNet50 model with the PlantNet tool. No other metrics such as precision or recall are mentioned in the provided context.
