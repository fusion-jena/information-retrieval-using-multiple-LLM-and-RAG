Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline for fire prediction uses raster data layers as its input. Raster data is a grid of cells, where each cell holds a value representing a specific attribute of the area it covers. In this case, the raster data layers used are FWI (Fire Weather Index) and FFMC (Fine Fuel Moisture Code), both of which have a spatial resolution of 1 Ã— 1 km. These data layers likely come in a format such as GeoTIFF, which is a common format for georeferenced raster data.

Furthermore, the context suggests that additional data layers, such as snow cover, could be included in the pipeline to improve prediction accuracy. These data layers would also be in raster format.

It is important to note that the context does not explicitly mention other data formats such as image, audio, or video. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline for fire prediction primarily uses raster data layers in GeoTIFF format as its input.
