Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance was evaluated using an error matrix, producer’s accuracy (PA), user’s accuracy (UA), and overall accuracy (OA) at the detailed classification level (Table 4 and 5a). The UA was calculated by comparing the predicted classes with the actual classes, and it was observed that there were considerable omissions mainly into scrub, Molina grassland, and modified bog, resulting in lower PA. The classification of extensive classes or those dominated by a single or just a few species was mapped with relatively high accuracies, and the classification was strongly driven by EO-datasets. The high model accuracies indicated that with nationally consistent training-data, data-driven algorithms can capture the spectral variations embedded within the EO-data reasonably well. The GMEP data was used for the accuracy assessment (Fig. 5), and the harmonisation of habitat classes within GMEP was demonstrated (Fig. 4). However, the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not provided.
