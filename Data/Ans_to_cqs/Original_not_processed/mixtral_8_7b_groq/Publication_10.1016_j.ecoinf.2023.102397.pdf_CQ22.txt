Answer:::

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include precision, recall, and the F-score. Precision is the proportion of recognizer hits that are true detections of the target species, calculated as tp/(tp + fp). Recall, on the other hand, is the proportion of target species vocalizations detected as hits by a recognizer, calculated as tp/(tp + fn). The F-score is a combination of precision and recall, where β is a user-defined metric that allows the prioritization of one of the two. In this case, β was set to 1, so precision and recall were evenly balanced in importance.

These metrics are used to assess the quality of the model's predictions by comparing them to the actual values. The error matrices, which contain true positives (tp), false positives (fp), false negatives (fn), and true negatives (tn), are used to calculate these metrics. The final evaluation parameters are derived from the error matrices, and the combination of precision and recall gives the F-score.

Another study, Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020), analyzed the effect of sample size on deep neural networks and found that by increasing the number of hidden layers, which can be interpreted as adding more training recordings in the software, the neural network can largely improve the performance of the model. However, they did not mention any specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model.

In summary, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are precision, recall, and the F-score, which are calculated based on the error matrices containing true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives. These metrics are used to assess the quality of the model's predictions by comparing them to the actual values.
