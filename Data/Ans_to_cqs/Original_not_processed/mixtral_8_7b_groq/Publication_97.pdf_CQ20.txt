Answer:::
The deep learning model was trained using a PC with a 1 GPGPU Nvidia Tesla K80 as the hardware resource. This information is provided in the context, which states that "all computations were performed on a PC with 1 GPGPU Nvidia Tesla K80 with 16 GB of RAM." This indicates that the neural network model was trained using a GPU, specifically the Nvidia Tesla K80, which is a high-performance graphics processing unit commonly used for machine learning and deep learning applications. No other hardware resources, such as TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), were mentioned as being used for training the model.
