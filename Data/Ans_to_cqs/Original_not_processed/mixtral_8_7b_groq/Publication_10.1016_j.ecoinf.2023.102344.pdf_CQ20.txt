The context does not provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It mentions various types of models, such as EfficientNet-Bo, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and hybrid deep neural networks using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), as well as techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA), and hybrid PCA-NCA. However, it does not specify the hardware used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query based on the given context.
