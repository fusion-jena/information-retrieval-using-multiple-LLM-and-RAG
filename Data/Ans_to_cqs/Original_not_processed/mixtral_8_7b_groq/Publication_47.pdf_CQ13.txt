Answer:::
The provided context discusses a deep learning model, IUC-NN, used to predict the conservation status of orchid species. However, it does not give specific details about the hyperparameters used in the model. Hyperparameters are configuration variables that govern the training process, such as the learning rate, the type of optimizer, the number of hidden layers, and the number of units in each layer.

The context does mention that the authors performed cross-validation and used a neural network with the lowest cross-entropy loss across a range of models with different numbers of hidden layers and subsets of features. This implies that they experimented with different architectures and hyperparameter settings. However, the specific values of these hyperparameters are not provided.

Therefore, I cannot give a specific answer to the query about the hyperparameters used in the IUC-NN model.
