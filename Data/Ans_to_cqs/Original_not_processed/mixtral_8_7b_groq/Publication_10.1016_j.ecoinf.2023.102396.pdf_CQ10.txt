Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link related to it. The context consists of ecological research articles and wildlife harvest summary reports, which do not mention or provide a link to a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
