Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions the use of the EF and SN models, which are likely deep learning models, but it does not specify the hardware used for training these models. The context includes details about the training setup, such as the batch size, number of epochs, early stopping, dropout rate, optimizer, weight decay, learning rate, and loss function, but it does not include information about the hardware resources used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
