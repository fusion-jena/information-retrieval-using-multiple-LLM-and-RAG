The context provided does not give specific information about the deep learning framework used to build the Inception-ResNet-v2 model. Therefore, I cannot give a definitive answer to this query.

However, it is important to note that Inception-ResNet-v2 is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that can be implemented in various deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and others.

For instance, in the TensorFlow framework, Inception-ResNet-v2 is available as a pre-trained model in the TensorFlow Hub, which is a repository of reusable machine learning models. Similarly, in PyTorch, there are open-source implementations of Inception-ResNet-v2 available in various repositories.

Therefore, while the context does not specify the deep learning framework used, it is likely that the Inception-ResNet-v2 model was implemented using one of the popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
