Answer: The text provided describes a deep learning model used for underwater target detection, but it does not explicitly name the type of model. However, based on the described components and techniques, we can infer that the model is most likely a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The SRC3 block, which is part of the model, employs convolution kernels for feature extraction. This is a key characteristic of CNNs, which use convolutional layers to scan through input data and extract features. Additionally, the text mentions the use of a feature pyramid network (FPN), which is a common technique used in CNN-based object detection models. FPNs help these models handle multiscale features more efficiently, allowing them to detect objects at different scales and resolutions.

Furthermore, the text mentions the use of an attention mechanism in the CRFPN, a novel feature fusion network. Attention mechanisms are commonly used in various deep learning architectures, including CNNs, to help the model focus on relevant features and suppress irrelevant ones.

While the text does not explicitly state that a CNN is used, the described components and techniques suggest that it is the most likely type of model.
