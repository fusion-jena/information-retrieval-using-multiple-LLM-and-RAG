Based on the provided context, the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, specifically for the LSTM models, are not explicitly stated as standard optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. However, it does mention the use of the TPEBO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization.

The TPEBO (Tree-structured Parzen Estimator for Bayesian Optimization) algorithm is a strategic approach to hyperparameter optimization. It begins with an exploratory phase of random searches for feasible hyperparameter configurations. Then, it progressively narrows down its focus to zones within the search space where a local optimum is identified, thereby approximating the global optimum with increasing precision. This methodological approach is particularly beneficial for fine-tuning LSTM models, known for their intricate structures.

The TPEBO algorithm is used to find the hyperparameter sets that deliver optimal performance in the LSTM neural network. The hyperparameters considered in this context include the L2 regularization parameter (Î» > 0) and the weights of each layer in the LSTM neural network (wj). The optimization process is conceptualized as a black-box function where diverse hyperparameter combinations are the inputs and the optimization targets are the outputs aimed at minimizing the objective metric.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the use of standard optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam, it does describe the use of the TPEBO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization in the LSTM models.
