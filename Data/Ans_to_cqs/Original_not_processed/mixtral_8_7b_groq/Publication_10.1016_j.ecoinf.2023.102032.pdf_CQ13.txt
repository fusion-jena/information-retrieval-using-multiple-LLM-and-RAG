Unfortunately, I don't have enough information to provide the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. The first piece of context, a Medium article from 2022, discusses improving cloud detection with machine learning but does not provide the necessary details about the wetland study. The second piece of context, an ecological informatics article from 2023, focuses on wetland use intensity in East Africa using Sentinel-2 data. However, the methodology section does not mention any deep learning model or its hyperparameters.

To find the answer, you would need to look for more specific information about the deep learning model used in the study. This could include reading the full ecological informatics article, reaching out to the authors for additional details, or looking for other sources that discuss the same research.
