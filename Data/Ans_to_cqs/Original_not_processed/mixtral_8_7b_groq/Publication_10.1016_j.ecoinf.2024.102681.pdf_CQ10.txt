Answer:::

 I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context mainly focuses on the study's findings about drought propagation, influencing factors, and the hybrid deep learning model (CNN-LSTM) employed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
