Based on the provided context, the text does not discuss a deep learning model in the traditional sense of neural networks with many layers. Instead, it describes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction, and learning rate functions for a paradise fish T-maze experiment. Therefore, I will answer based on the SVM model and learning rate functions.

Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the discussed model include the regularization parameter (C), the kernel type (linear), and the kernel coefficient (gamma) for non-linear SVMs. The learning rate functions (V1(x) and V2(x)) are used to model the evolution of preference as the paradise fish learns from its environment.

Regarding the SVM model, the regularization parameter (C) and the kernel type (linear) were calibrated using a combination of grid search and cross-validation. This process aimed to balance model complexity and its generalization ability. In the case of non-linear SVMs, the kernel coefficient (gamma) underwent optimization via grid search to ensure the model's attunement to the data distribution.

The learning rate functions (V1(x) and V2(x)) are algebraic expressions that represent the probabilistic inclination towards choosing a specific direction (left or right) within the T-maze. These functions model the evolution of preference as the paradise fish learns from its environment.

In summary, the hyperparameters used in the discussed model include the regularization parameter (C), the kernel type (linear), and the kernel coefficient (gamma) for non-linear SVMs. Additionally, learning rate functions (V1(x) and V2(x)) were employed to model the paradise fish's learning process in the T-maze experiment.
