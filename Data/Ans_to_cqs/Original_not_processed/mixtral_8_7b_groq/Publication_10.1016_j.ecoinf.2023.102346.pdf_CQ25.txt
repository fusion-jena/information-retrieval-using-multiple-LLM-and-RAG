Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the use of a deep learning model in the described studies. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately answer the query regarding the purpose of the deep learning model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection).

However, the context does mention the use of various machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling purposes, such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Generalized Boosting regression Model (GBM), and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT). These algorithms are commonly used for classification, regression, and clustering tasks, among others.

Moreover, some of the studies mentioned in the context use ensemble modeling approaches, which combine multiple models to improve predictive performance. Ensemble modeling can be used for various purposes, such as increasing the accuracy of predictions, reducing overfitting, and improving the robustness of models.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model, it does describe the use of various machine learning algorithms and ensemble modeling approaches for predictive modeling purposes. However, without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific purpose of a deep learning model in this context.
