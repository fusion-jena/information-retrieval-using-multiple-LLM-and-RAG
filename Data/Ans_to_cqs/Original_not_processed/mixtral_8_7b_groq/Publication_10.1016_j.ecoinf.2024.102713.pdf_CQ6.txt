Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model for the CASE project or any other specific project. However, I can provide some general preprocessing steps that are commonly involved in deep learning model training.

Answer:::

In deep learning model training, several preprocessing steps are usually applied to the data before feeding it into the model. These steps may include:

1. Data cleaning: This step involves removing any irrelevant, missing, or inconsistent data from the dataset. For instance, if there are missing values in the dataset, you can either remove those rows or impute the missing values using techniques such as mean or median imputation.
2. Data normalization/scaling: Deep learning models are sensitive to the scale of the input features. Therefore, it is essential to normalize or scale the data to a similar range. Common techniques for data normalization include min-max scaling, z-score normalization, and decimal scaling.
3. Data augmentation: This technique is particularly useful when working with image data. Data augmentation involves creating new synthetic samples from the existing dataset by applying random transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping. This technique can help improve the model's performance by increasing the size of the training dataset.
4. Feature extraction: In some cases, it may be necessary to extract relevant features from the dataset before training the deep learning model. Feature extraction techniques may include principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), or wavelet transforms.
5. Data splitting: Finally, it is essential to split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. This step ensures that the model is evaluated on unseen data, providing a more accurate estimate of its performance.

While the provided context does not mention any specific preprocessing steps for the CASE project, it does mention that the data undergoes validation and loading into the Access tier through an incremental ETL procedure. It is possible that some preprocessing steps are applied during this process, but the context does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion.
