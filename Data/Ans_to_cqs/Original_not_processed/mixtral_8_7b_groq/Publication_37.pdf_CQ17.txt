Answer:::

The two regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline for the classification of migrating birds' flight calls are dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is applied to the input of the last two layers with a probability of 0.5. Dropout is a technique used during training where randomly selected neurons are ignored, or "dropped out". This helps to prevent overfitting by making the network more robust and reducing co-adaptation of feature detectors.

L2 regularization is applied to the weights of the last two layers with a penalty factor of 0.001. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages the weights to be small, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.

These regularization methods are used in conjunction with a constant learning rate of 0.01 and data augmentation to train the model for 100 epochs. The model is checkpointed after each epoch and a validation set is used to identify the parameter setting achieving the highest classification accuracy.
