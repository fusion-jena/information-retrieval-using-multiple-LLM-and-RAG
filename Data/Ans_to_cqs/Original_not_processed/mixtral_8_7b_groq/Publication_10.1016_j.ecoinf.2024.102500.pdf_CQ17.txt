The provided context discusses the use of machine learning models, including deep learning, to address large and dynamic water quality datasets and prevent overfitting. However, the context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Nevertheless, the context does mention that hyperparameter tuning plays a crucial role in optimizing the performance of a model by improving its ability to predict observed and predicted ranges. This process includes controlling overfitting or underfitting issues. In the case of the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) model, subsamples are used to reduce overfitting, and reg_lambda is used to prevent overfitting. Similarly, for the gradient boosting model, hyperparameters such as colsample_bytree, learning rate, max_depth, and n_estimators are varied to address overfitting issues.

In deep learning, regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used to prevent overfitting. Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are dropped during training, preventing over-reliance on any one neuron and reducing overfitting. L2 regularization, on the other hand, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages smaller weight values, reducing overfitting by preventing the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization in the deep learning pipeline, it is reasonable to assume that these regularization methods are being used in addition to hyperparameter tuning to prevent overfitting.
