Answer:::

The provided context discusses various techniques used to address data biases and improve the predictive performance of machine learning models, including deep learning models. However, it does not explicitly mention the strategies you listed in the context of a deep learning pipeline's preprocessing stage. Nonetheless, I can provide explanations for those strategies and relate them to the given context.

1. Stratified splitting: Stratified sampling is a method of dividing a dataset into subgroups that maintain the original dataset's proportion of classes. This technique can be used during the train-test split to ensure that both sets have a similar distribution of classes. Although not explicitly mentioned in the context, this method can be applied to the data splitting process to improve model performance.

2. Oversampling: Oversampling is a technique that increases the frequency of the minority class in a dataset to balance it with the majority class. This method can help prevent models from being biased towards the majority class. The provided context discusses using a bootstrapping approach to address spatial sampling biases, which can be seen as a form of oversampling, as it replicates data points to create a more balanced dataset.

3. Undersampling: Undersampling is the opposite of oversampling, where the majority class is reduced in frequency to balance the dataset. While the context does not explicitly mention undersampling, it discusses using a bootstrapping approach with a minimum thinning distance of 1 km. This process results in a reduced dataset, which can be seen as a form of undersampling.

4. Diverse data collection: Diverse data collection refers to gathering data from various sources or under different conditions to ensure that the dataset is representative and unbiased. The context discusses using data mining techniques to extract valuable information from large datasets and simulating fire behavior and spread under various artificially set conditions. These methods can be seen as ways of collecting diverse data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies you listed in the context of a deep learning pipeline's preprocessing stage, it discusses related techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These methods can be applied during the preprocessing stage to improve the predictive performance of deep learning models.
