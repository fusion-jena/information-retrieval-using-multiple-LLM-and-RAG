Answer:::
The code repository link for the deep learning pipeline is available on GitHub. You can access the repository at <https://github.com/HpcDataLab/ToxicovigilanceTool>. This repository contains the source code, activity data, and the pre-trained model for the deep learning architecture used as a toxicovigilance tool in the study titled "Using honey bee flight activity data and a deep learning model as a toxicovigilance tool" by Olivares-Pinto et al. The study was published in the Ecological Informatics journal.
