Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, it does mention that a training dataset has been made available, which could be useful for learning and conducting experiments.

The context mainly focuses on the methodology used for reducing human effort in biodiversity observation initiatives. It highlights the challenges faced due to the nature of tweets, such as a low number of words and not always well-written messages, which makes it difficult to obtain useful information and leads to a high number of tweets being lost in the filtering process.

To address these challenges, the context suggests that biodiversity observations only make sense when accompanied by their location. This allows for various applications, such as alerting about the presence of invasive species or reusing the information in species distribution models.

Therefore, while the text does not provide specific details on postprocessing steps like Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix, it does emphasize the importance of location data in biodiversity observations and the value of a well-prepared training dataset for learning and experimentation.
