Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the IUC-NN pipeline is not explicitly specified in the provided context as a well-known model like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer. Instead, the authors implemented a custom deep neural network algorithm using the TensorFlow library in Python. This neural network takes four groups of features derived from digitally available occurrence records as inputs: geographic, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic. The network's architecture and training details can be found in the Supporting Information.
