Answer:
The provided context does not directly discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) mapping, a common application of deep learning.

Remote Sensing typically involves the use of sensors to capture data. These sensors can be mounted on various platforms, including satellites, aircraft, and drones. For instance, the context mentions the use of Sentinel imagery, which is a type of satellite imagery provided by the European Union's Copernicus Program. 

Additionally, public datasets can be a valuable source of raw data for deep learning. The context refers to the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform, which provides access to a large collection of satellite imagery and other geospatial data. 

Moreover, the context also discusses the importance of selecting representative training samples. These samples are typically manually extracted from the raw data, i.e., the RS imagery.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for LULC mapping include the use of sensors (mounted on satellites, aircraft, or drones) to capture RS imagery, and the use of public datasets providing access to such imagery. The raw data is then processed, which includes the selection of representative training samples.
