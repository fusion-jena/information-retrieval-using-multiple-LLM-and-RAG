Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link related to it. The study described in the context used the BIOMOD2 package in R to employ an ensemble modeling approach for predicting the distribution of study species. The models used include one regression-based model and three machine-learning models (MaxEnt, RF, and SVM). The models' performance was tested using cross-validation and the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) as the accuracy index. The study also constructed habitat suitability models of the three species under the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios for 2070. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link in the provided context.
