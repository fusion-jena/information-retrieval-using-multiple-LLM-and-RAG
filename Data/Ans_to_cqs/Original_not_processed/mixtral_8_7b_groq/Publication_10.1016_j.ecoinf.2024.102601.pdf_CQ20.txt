The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the focus of the study is primarily on hyperparameter optimization for a random forest (RF) algorithm in the context of wildfire mapping, rather than deep learning models or specialized hardware like GPUs or TPUs.

The text mentions the use of the scikit-learn library, which is a general-purpose machine learning library for Python, and does not specifically target deep learning or GPU/TPU computation. The hyperparameter optimization techniques used, such as RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV, are also commonly used in traditional machine learning algorithms, including RF, and do not necessarily imply the use of specialized hardware for deep learning models.

In summary, based on the provided context, it is not possible to definitively answer the query regarding the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.
