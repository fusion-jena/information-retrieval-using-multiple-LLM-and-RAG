Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. The text only briefly touches upon the concept of a learning decay rate, which is set to 0.7, but it does not specify whether this is part of an optimization algorithm like SGD or Adam.

The learning decay rate is used to gradually decrease the learning rate as training progresses. This technique can be a part of various optimization algorithms like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), but the context does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion.

In summary, while the context provides information about the deep learning pipeline, it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used, such as SGD or Adam. The learning decay rate is mentioned, but it is unclear whether this is a part of a specific optimization algorithm.
