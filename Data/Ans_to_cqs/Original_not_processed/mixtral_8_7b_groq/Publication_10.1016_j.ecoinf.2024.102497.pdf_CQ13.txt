Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model for bathymetry estimation. However, there is a study that compares deep learning and physics-based approaches for coastal bathymetry estimation using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery (Najar et al., 2022). This study uses a deep learning model but does not mention the hyperparameters used.

In general, hyperparameters are important configuration variables that can significantly affect the performance of deep learning models. Some common hyperparameters in deep learning models include learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, and activation function.

The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. The optimizer is a method that updates the weights and biases of the model based on the gradient of the loss function. The number of layers and neurons determines the complexity of the model. The batch size is the number of samples processed before the model is updated. The activation function introduces non-linearity into the model.

In the context of bathymetry estimation using remote sensing data, hyperparameters can be tuned to optimize the performance of the deep learning model. For example, the learning rate can be adjusted to balance the trade-off between convergence speed and accuracy. The optimizer can be chosen based on the characteristics of the data and the problem. The number of layers and neurons can be adjusted to balance the trade-off between model complexity and overfitting. The batch size can be adjusted to balance the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy. The activation function can be chosen based on the distribution of the data and the desired output.

In summary, while there is no specific information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model for bathymetry estimation in the provided context, hyperparameters are important configuration variables that can significantly affect the performance of deep learning models. Hyperparameters can be tuned to optimize the performance of the model for bathymetry estimation using remote sensing data.
