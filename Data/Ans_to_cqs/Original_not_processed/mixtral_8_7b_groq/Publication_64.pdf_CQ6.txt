Answer:::

In the context provided, several preprocessing steps are taken before training a deep learning model for plant classification.

Firstly, for the Google Image Search dataset, they select the labels with more than 12 images and automatically retrieve the first 10 images returned by the Google Image Search engine. This is done to minimize the presence of mislabeled images.

Secondly, the data augmentation techniques applied during training include sheering, translation, and mirroring. However, they do not apply rotation or upside-down mirroring to images tagged as 'habit' because it does not make much sense to have a tree or a landscape upside down.

Thirdly, after applying the transformations, they downscale the image to the ResNet standard 224 input size.

Lastly, they initialize the weights of the model with pretrained weights on the ImageNet dataset provided in the Lasagne Model Zoo.

Therefore, the preprocessing steps involved include data selection, data augmentation, resizing, and weight initialization with pretrained weights. However, there is no explicit mention of normalization or scaling of the pixel values in the given context.
