Answer: In the deep learning pipeline, several data augmentation techniques have been applied to enhance the diversity of the dataset and improve the model's robustness. These techniques include modifications in brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue, as well as random horizontal and vertical flips, random rotations up to thirty degrees, and the incorporation of Gaussian noise.

Firstly, the images were reduced to a manageable size of 224 Ã— 224 pixels to enhance computational performance. Then, brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue modifications were applied to the images, which helped to simulate various lighting conditions and color variations. These adjustments can improve the model's ability to generalize and perform well in different environments.

Additionally, random horizontal and vertical flips were applied to the images, which effectively increased the dataset's size and contributed to the model's robustness. This technique helps the model learn features invariant to their spatial orientation, which is essential for many vision tasks.

Random rotations up to thirty degrees were also applied, allowing the model to learn features that are invariant to orientation changes. This is particularly important for tasks where the object of interest may appear in different angles.

Lastly, Gaussian noise was incorporated into the images to improve the model's robustness in various conditions. Gaussian noise adds random variations to the pixel intensities, which can help the model learn to handle uncertainties and noise present in real-world data.

However, it is important to note that the mean images used in the statistical analysis of the dataset had low resolution, leading to a loss of detail and clarity in the final averaged images. This issue does not seem to be related to the data augmentation techniques but rather the resolution of the images employed in creating the mean images.
