The provided context does not give specific details about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention some data-related processes that could be considered part of the preprocessing pipeline.

First, the context discusses the use of "annotation sets" as a form of pseudo ground truth, which suggests that some form of data labeling is taking place. This step might involve listening to underwater acoustic recordings and identifying cetacean vocalizations, which are then used as training data for the deep learning models.

The context also mentions the use of two annotation aggregation methods: majority voting and soft labeling. Majority voting involves selecting the most frequently occurring label for each data point, while soft labeling assigns a probability distribution over all possible labels. These methods could be used to increase the reliability of the annotations and reduce the presence of noisy labels.

In terms of data cleaning, the context mentions the use of an early stopping method during training to prevent overfitting. This technique involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set and stopping the training process once the model's performance starts to degrade. This helps to ensure that the final model is not overly influenced by outlier data points or noise in the training set.

Finally, the context mentions the importance of maintaining consistent hyperparameters across all training instances for each task. While this is not a preprocessing step per se, it does speak to the importance of careful data preparation and management in order to ensure that the deep learning models are trained effectively.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about data normalization, scaling, or other common preprocessing steps, it does mention some data-related processes that could be considered part of the preprocessing pipeline. These include annotation, annotation aggregation, data cleaning, and consistent hyperparameter selection.
