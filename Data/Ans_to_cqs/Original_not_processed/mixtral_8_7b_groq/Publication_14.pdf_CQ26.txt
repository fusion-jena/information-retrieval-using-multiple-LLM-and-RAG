Answer:::

The provided context does not contain specific information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline for the DeepMeerkat project. However, it does mention that the project used data from Snapshot Serengeti, which contains high-frequency annotated camera trap images of 40 mammalian species in an African savanna (Swanson et al., 2015). The paper discussing Snapshot Serengeti does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing.

In general, techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting ensures that the train and test datasets have a similar distribution of classes. Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances from the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of instances from the majority class. Diverse data collection aims to gather data from various sources, domains, or demographics to ensure that the dataset is representative of the target population.

The DeepMeerkat project uses a deep convolutional neural network for background subtraction (Babaee et al., 2017) and mentions the use of dropout as a form of regularization to reduce overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2014). However, these techniques are not directly related to addressing data bias during preprocessing.
