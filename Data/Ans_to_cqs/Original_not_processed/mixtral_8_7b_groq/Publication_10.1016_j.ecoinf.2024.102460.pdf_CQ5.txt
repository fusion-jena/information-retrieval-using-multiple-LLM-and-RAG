Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The LSTM-PLUS-FMOP framework mentioned in the context is a custom deep learning model developed for a specific study on land use/cover change. It is not specified if it was trained or tested using any of the standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
