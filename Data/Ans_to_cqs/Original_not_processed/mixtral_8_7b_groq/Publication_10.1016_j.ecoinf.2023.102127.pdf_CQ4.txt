The provided context discusses the use of Species Distribution Models (SDMs) in the context of biodiversity datasets, with a focus on methods for creating less biased representations of species niches. However, the context does not directly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, and scaling.

Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, which can help improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. These techniques work by creating new synthetic samples by applying various transformations to the existing data.

For example, in the context of image classification, flipping an image horizontally or vertically can create a new sample that helps the model learn to recognize features regardless of their orientation. Rotating an image can help the model learn to recognize features at different angles, while scaling can help the model learn to recognize features at different sizes.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, it does discuss the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for multi-nominal predictions in the context of biodiversity datasets. CNNs are a type of deep learning model that are particularly well-suited to image classification tasks, and data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in conjunction with CNNs to improve their performance.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly answer the query, it is reasonable to infer that data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling could be applied in the deep learning pipeline for biodiversity datasets, particularly in conjunction with CNNs for multi-nominal predictions. However, further research would be needed to determine the specific benefits and drawbacks of these techniques in this context.
