Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context contains details about various deep learning techniques and applications in the field of fish length and catch numbers monitoring, aquaculture, pruning techniques for deep neural networks, model compression, and underwater fish individual recognition. However, there is no mention of the code repository link for these pipelines. It is possible that the authors have not made the code publicly available, or it may be hosted on a different platform. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to the code repository.
