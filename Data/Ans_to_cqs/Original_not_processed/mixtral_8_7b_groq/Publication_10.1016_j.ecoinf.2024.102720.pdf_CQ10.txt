Answer:::

I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions the use of a deep learning algorithm for strategic planning (IseB 21, 9) in a report from 1998 and the use of deep learning in a study published in 2021 (Ren et al., 2021), but it does not provide a link to the code repository.
