Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided in the context to accurately answer the query. The context discusses the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques in smart farming, but it does not mention any specific frameworks used to build deep learning models.

However, based on general knowledge and common practice in the field of deep learning, some popular frameworks used to build deep learning models include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google Brain Team, while PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library. Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.

It's worth noting that the choice of framework for building deep learning models depends on various factors such as the specific problem being addressed, the size and complexity of the data, the required computational resources, and the expertise of the developers.

Therefore, while I cannot provide a specific answer based on the given context, I can provide some general information on popular deep learning frameworks.
