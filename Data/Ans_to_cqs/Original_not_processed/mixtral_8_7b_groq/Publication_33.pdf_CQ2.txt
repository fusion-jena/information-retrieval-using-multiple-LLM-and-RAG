Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in the context provided primarily uses underwater fish images extracted from high-definition videos as its data format. The videos, recorded in 1920 Ã— 1,080 pixels, are the primary source of data, from which individual fish images are extracted for analysis.

The videos are recorded in various conditions, including different depths (2 to 30 meters), luminosity levels, transparency, and benthic environment conditions on fringing and barrier reefs. These variations in conditions add complexity to the data, making the deep learning task more challenging.

The use of custom-built datasets, instead of existing ones, allows the researchers to tailor the data to the specific needs of marine ecologists, ensuring the quality of videos used is current and relevant. The datasets are constructed from 175 underwater videos, resulting in a total of 83 hours of video data.

The researchers use machine learning methods and deep learning algorithms (DLAs) to process this video data, with the goal of eventually applying these methods to larger datasets, including video and audio formats, for real-time biodiversity monitoring. However, the specifics of audio data usage are not mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline in this context is underwater fish images extracted from high-definition videos. The pipeline also has the potential to be expanded to include audio data in the future.
