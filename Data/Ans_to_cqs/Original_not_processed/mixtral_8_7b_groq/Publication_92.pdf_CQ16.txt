Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the coral reef fish detection and recognition in underwater videos. Commonly used criteria for determining training completion include validation loss plateau, convergence of training or validation error, or reaching a predefined threshold for the number of epochs or level of accuracy.

In the context, there is information about the dataset, preprocessing, and post-processing techniques used for fish detection and recognition. However, there is no mention of the training stopping criteria. It is possible that the authors used one or more of the common criteria mentioned above or have developed specific criteria based on their research objectives and dataset characteristics.

Another possibility is that the information about training completion criteria is provided in other sections of the paper or in related works cited in the references. For example, Atkinson et al. (1997), Schmidhuber (2015), Lecun et al. (1998), Szegedy et al. (2015), and Joly et al. (2015) are some of the references that might contain relevant information on this topic.

In summary, the provided context does not contain specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the coral reef fish detection and recognition in underwater videos. Commonly used criteria include validation loss plateau, convergence of training or validation error, or reaching a predefined threshold for the number of epochs or level of accuracy. The authors might have used one or more of these criteria or developed specific criteria based on their research objectives and dataset characteristics.
