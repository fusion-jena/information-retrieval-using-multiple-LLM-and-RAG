The provided context includes a table (Table 3) that lists the hyperparameters for several machine learning models, including some deep learning models (DNN and NNET). However, the specific hyperparameters requested in the query, such as the learning rate or optimizer, are not provided in the table.

The query does mention deep learning models with a Deep Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (DeepConvLSTM) architecture and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. However, the context does not provide information on the hyperparameters used for these specific deep learning models.

The context does mention that the deep learning models were selected using a model selection procedure, which involved generating 5 models for each of four deep-ANN architecture types and training each model for 4 epochs. The accuracy of the candidate models was then compared using a validation data set, and the model with the highest performance was selected for training on the full training data for up to 30 epochs. However, the specific hyperparameters used during this model selection procedure are not provided in the context.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models.
