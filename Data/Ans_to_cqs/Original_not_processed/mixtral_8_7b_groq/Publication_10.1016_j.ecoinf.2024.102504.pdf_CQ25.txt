Answer:::

The deep learning model in the context provided is used for time series prediction, specifically for predicting air quality indices. In the study by Navares and Aznarte (2020), a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model was used to predict air quality with high accuracy. The model was trained on historical air quality data and was able to predict future values of pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM), and other harmful substances.

The LSTM model is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is particularly well-suited to time series data because it can maintain an internal state that captures information about previous inputs. This makes it capable of learning complex patterns and dependencies in the data, which is essential for accurate air quality prediction.

The study by Gokul et al. (2023) also used an LSTM model to predict PM2.5 levels in Hyderabad city, and it outperformed other machine learning models with an R2 value of 0.89 and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 12.54 Î¼g/m3. This demonstrates the potential of deep learning models for accurate air quality prediction, which can be used for early warning systems and for informing public health policies.

In summary, the deep learning model in the provided context is used for time series prediction of air quality indices, specifically for predicting pollutant levels such as NO2 and PM. The LSTM model is used for this purpose due to its ability to learn complex patterns and dependencies in the data.
