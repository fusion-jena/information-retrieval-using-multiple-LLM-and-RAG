Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model, as described in the context, is land use and land cover (LULC) classification. This model utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is specifically designed to process multidimensional data, such as raster bands stack from satellite images.

The input layer of the model receives the raster bands stack and passes it to the subsequent layers. The convolutional layer, followed by the pooling layer, extracts essential features from the input data by applying convolution and pooling operations, respectively. These operations help in identifying patterns and reducing the dimensionality of the data.

The fully connected layer then captures more complex nonlinear dependencies and generalizes information from previous layers. This layer performs matrix multiplication between input data and weights, allowing it to model intricate relationships between features.

Finally, the output layer generates the LULC classification predictions using an activation function like Softmax. This function produces probability estimates for each LULC class, enabling the model to decide the most likely class for each pixel in the input data.

The ultimate result of this classification process is the LULC map, where each pixel represents the class it belongs to, based on the model's predictions. Therefore, the deep learning model in this context is designed for LULC classification, aiming to accurately identify and categorize different land cover forms based on their spectral signatures.
