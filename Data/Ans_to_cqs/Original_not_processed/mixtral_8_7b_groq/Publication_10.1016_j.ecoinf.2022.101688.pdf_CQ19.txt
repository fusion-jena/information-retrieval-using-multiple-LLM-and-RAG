Answer:::

The deep learning model for bioacoustics research is built using the TensorFlow framework. The software code for audio pre-processing and the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are developed in Python 3, while the CNNs are specifically implemented in TensorFlow 2. The models are trained for 50 epochs using the Adam optimizer and a batch size of 32. The hyper-parameters are obtained through a random search, with values similar to those used in the study by Dufourq et al. (2021). Spectrograms are generated using the Librosa library.

In addition to TensorFlow, other architectures are also used in the literature, such as AlexNet, which was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. Lu et al. (2021) explored the effect of varying the number of last layers within the network that were trained from random initialisation. They created a binary classification model (presence and absence) for which there was little effect on the results.

Therefore, the primary framework used for building the deep learning model for bioacoustics research is TensorFlow, while other architectures such as AlexNet are also used in the literature.
