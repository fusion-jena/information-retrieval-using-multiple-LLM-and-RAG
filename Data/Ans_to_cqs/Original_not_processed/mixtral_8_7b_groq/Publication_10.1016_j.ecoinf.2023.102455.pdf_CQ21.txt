Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics such as R (coefficient of determination), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the models.

For instance, in the first section of the context, several models including MVMD-KELM, MVMD-CNN-BiRNN, CNN-BiGRU, RVFL, and KELM were trained and tested. After each testing phase, the R, RMSE, and MAPE values were calculated and reported. This indicates that the calculation of these metrics is a standard postprocessing step after the model training.

In addition, in the third section of the context, the postprocessing steps involved the calculation of R, RMSE, and MAPE after the model training for CNN-BiGRU, RVFL, KELM, and CNN-BiRNN models. Furthermore, the details of the hyperparameters used for these models were also provided, indicating that tuning these hyperparameters and comparing the model performance based on the calculated metrics is another postprocessing step.

However, the context does not mention any other postprocessing steps such as generating saliency maps or confusion matrices. Saliency maps are used to highlight the important features in the input data that the model uses for making predictions. Confusion matrices are used to evaluate the performance of classification models by comparing the predicted labels with the actual labels.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics such as R, RMSE, and MAPE, and tuning the hyperparameters to improve the model performance.
