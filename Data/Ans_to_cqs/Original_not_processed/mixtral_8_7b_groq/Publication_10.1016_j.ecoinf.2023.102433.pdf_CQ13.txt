I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. The context discusses the NasaWebServiceAPIProvider class and its methods for accessing NASA data, but it does not mention any deep learning model or its hyperparameters.

Hyperparameters are important configuration variables in machine learning models, including deep learning models. They can include learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, and many others. The choice of hyperparameters can significantly impact the performance of the model.

Without more information, it's not possible to provide an accurate answer to the query. If you have more context or details about the deep learning model in question, I would be happy to help you further.
