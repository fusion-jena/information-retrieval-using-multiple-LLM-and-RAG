Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the process of extracting and selecting videos related to wild birds (Yacho) from YouTube, as well as the explanatory variables and random effects considered in the models. However, it does not mention any specific methods for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
