Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in the study discussed uses image data format. The study focuses on cactus recognition in aerial images. The images are the primary data format used for training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The images are preprocessed and used as input to the CNN for feature extraction and classification. There is no mention of using other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV in the described deep learning pipeline.

The dataset used in the study is built specifically for the task of cactus recognition in aerial images. The dataset is analyzed and constructed based on the Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Valley in Mexico, which is an arid region with a unique set of cacti species. The dataset construction methodology is discussed in detail, but there is no mention of using any data formats other than images.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in this study uses image data format as the primary input for training the CNN model.
