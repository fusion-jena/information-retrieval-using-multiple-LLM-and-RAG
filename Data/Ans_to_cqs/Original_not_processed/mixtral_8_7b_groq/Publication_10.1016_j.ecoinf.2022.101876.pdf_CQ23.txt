Answer:::

The text provided does not give explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention the importance of having a well-trained model on a particular object class for more generalizable minimum detection size limits. It also emphasizes the significance of using a variety of well-labeled image sets to verify the accuracy of model output and the level of scrutiny manual human reviewers put into identifying wildlife in images.

The authors encourage prospective AI users to carry out similar evaluations as performed in the study to gain more relevant information on model performance specific to their study systems. This suggests that the generalizability of the model may be improved by evaluating its performance on different datasets and systems.

In summary, while the text does not provide explicit details about measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, it does highlight the importance of using a well-trained model on a particular object class and evaluating the model's performance on various image sets and systems for more generalizable results.
