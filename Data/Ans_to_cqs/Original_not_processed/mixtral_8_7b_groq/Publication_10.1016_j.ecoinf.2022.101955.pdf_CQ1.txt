The provided context does not directly answer the query about the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of remote sensing data in the context of land use and land cover classification.

Remote sensing data is typically collected through various types of sensors, including satellite, airborne, and ground-based sensors. These sensors capture reflected and emitted radiation from the Earth's surface, which can be used to extract information about land cover, land use, and other environmental variables.

For example, the study by Duro et al. (2012) used SPOT-5 HRG imagery, which is a type of satellite remote sensing data, for the classification of agricultural landscapes. Similarly, the study by Cracknell and Reading (2014) used remote sensing data to compare the performance of five machine learning algorithms in geological mapping.

Public datasets of remote sensing data are also available, such as the Landsat program, which provides free and open access to satellite imagery of the Earth's surface. These datasets can be used as input to deep learning models for various applications, such as land cover classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention surveys or other methods for collecting raw data, it does suggest that remote sensing data is a common source of input data for deep learning models in the context of land use and land cover classification.
