Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline for land use and land cover (LULC) classification is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This specific deep learning architecture is chosen due to its wide application and success in image processing and feature extraction tasks. CNNs are particularly suitable for LULC classification as they can automatically extract spatial hierarchical features from data, making them an ideal choice for analyzing satellite images and other raster data.
