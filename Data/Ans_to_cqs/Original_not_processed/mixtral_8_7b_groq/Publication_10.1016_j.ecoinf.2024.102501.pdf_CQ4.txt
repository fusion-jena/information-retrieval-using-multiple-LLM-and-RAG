Answer:::

Based on the information provided, the context does not discuss specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling that were applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning methods, specifically Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, for predicting dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in water. It highlights the importance of considering various parameters, such as water quality, temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, for improving the predictive performance of DO concentration models.

The article mentions that deep learning methods, like LSTM networks, can be powerful but may require large datasets and substantial computational resources. They can be prone to overfitting, especially when the available data is limited or noisy, as is often the case in aquaculture environments. However, it does not delve into the specific data augmentation techniques used to mitigate overfitting or improve the generalization ability of the models.

Therefore, without additional information, it is not possible to provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline discussed in the article.
