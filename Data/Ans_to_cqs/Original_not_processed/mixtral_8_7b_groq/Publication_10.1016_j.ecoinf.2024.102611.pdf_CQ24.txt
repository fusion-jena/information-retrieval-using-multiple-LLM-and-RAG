The provided context discusses the use of machine learning, specifically the Random Forest classifier, for modeling and classifying herbal plants. However, it does not directly mention strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, such as the use of a random seed value.

In the context, a Random Forest classifier is used for performing group and plant-level predictions. This classifier is a type of ensemble learning method, which combines multiple decision trees to improve the overall performance and reduce overfitting. The final prediction is made by taking the average of the predictions from each decision tree. The number of decision trees, denoted as N, is a hyperparameter that can be tuned to improve the model's performance.

The data collection is split into eleven groups based on visual morphological characteristics, and each group consists of several plant species varieties. The training, validation, and testing proportion is set as 70:20:10 for both levels, except for the GSL100 datasets. Two additional datasets, RTL80 and RTP40, are used to assess the efficiency of the proposed hierarchical classification model. These datasets are randomly collected in real-time scenarios to analyze the sensitivity of the classifier samples.

Although the context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, the concept of randomness is inherent in the data splitting process and the use of random forests. The data splitting process involves randomly assigning samples to the training, validation, and testing sets, while the random forests classifier involves building multiple decision trees using random subsets of the training data.

In deep learning pipelines, a random seed value is often used to ensure reproducibility of the results. By setting a specific seed value, the random number generator used in the pipeline produces the same sequence of random numbers, which leads to the same data splits and initial weights for the model. This is important for comparing different models and hyperparameters, as it ensures that any differences in performance are due to the changes made to the model and not due to randomness in the data splitting or initialization process.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, the concept of randomness is inherent in the data splitting process and the use of random forests. In deep learning pipelines, a random seed value is often used to ensure reproducibility of the results.
