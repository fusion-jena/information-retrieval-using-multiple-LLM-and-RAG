Based on the provided context, there are several preprocessing steps that can be involved before training a deep learning model, although the specific steps are not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer some steps from the context.

Firstly, the data used in the study mentioned in the context is related to Sika Deer and cow vocalizations. Therefore, the preprocessing steps might include audio signal processing techniques. One such technique mentioned in the context is the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) window size. The researchers opted for a larger FFT window size to improve the resolution at lower frequencies where cows vocalize. This suggests that audio signal processing, including frequency analysis, might be one of the preprocessing steps.

Secondly, the context mentions that the researchers fitted cow-specific parameters in the model, which could explain why their model detected a much larger number of cow vocalizations compared to another study. This implies that feature engineering or extraction might be another preprocessing step involved. The researchers might have extracted features specific to cow vocalizations, such as pitch, frequency, or duration, and used them as inputs to the deep learning model.

Thirdly, the context mentions a recent study using the Red Deer as a study species obtained recall rates of approximately 90% for five supervised machine learning algorithms tested. Although this study is not directly related to the preprocessing steps, it suggests that data preprocessing techniques such as data cleaning, normalization, or scaling might have been applied before training the machine learning algorithms. These techniques are commonly used in deep learning as well, and they help to improve the model's performance by reducing the effects of outliers, noise, or varying scales in the data.

In summary, based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model might include audio signal processing techniques such as frequency analysis, feature engineering or extraction, and data preprocessing techniques such as data cleaning, normalization, or scaling. However, the specific preprocessing steps are not explicitly mentioned in the context, and they might vary depending on the data and the deep learning model used.
