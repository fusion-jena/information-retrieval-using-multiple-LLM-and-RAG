The provided article does not give specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text mentions the use of a machine learning (ML) model called MegaDetector, which produces bounding boxes around animals, people, and vehicles in remote camera imagery. However, it does not specify the type of hardware used for training this model.

Typically, deep learning models like MegaDetector are trained using specialized hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). These hardware resources can significantly speed up the training process compared to using a Central Processing Unit (CPU) alone.

In the context of the article, the focus is on evaluating the impact of the ML model's performance on its ability to accelerate human labeling in wildlife monitoring. The authors are interested in understanding how the model's correct and incorrect predictions influence tagging efficiency. Therefore, the article does not necessarily need to delve into the specifics of the hardware resources used for training the model. Nonetheless, it would be beneficial to know the hardware specifications to better understand the computational requirements and resources needed to train similar deep learning models for wildlife monitoring applications.
