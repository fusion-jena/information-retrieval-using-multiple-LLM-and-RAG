Answer:::

The text provided discusses several methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline, although it does not explicitly name dropout or L2 regularization. 

One method used is pre-training on neural networks, specifically ResNet50 and Inception. However, this method did not significantly improve classification performance, so it was not used in the final architecture. 

The Adam optimizer was selected with an initial learning rate of 0.007. The use of an optimizer like Adam can be seen as a form of regularization, as it helps to minimize the risk of overfitting by adjusting the learning rate during training.

Early stopping was also used to prevent overfitting. This method involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training, and stopping the training process once the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade.

The text also mentions the use of cross-validation, where the assembled database of annotated clips was divided into five folds, with 10% of the data reserved for comparing the training and validation loss/accuracy after each epoch, and a further 10% reserved for performance testing after all training had ceased. Cross-validation is another regularization technique, as it helps to ensure that the model's performance is not overly dependent on the specific training data used.

Finally, the text mentions the use of the area under the curve, as computed by a Riemann sum, as a metric for training. This metric can be seen as a form of regularization, as it provides a more comprehensive measure of the model's performance than simply looking at accuracy.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly name dropout or L2 regularization, it does discuss several methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline, including the use of optimizers, early stopping, cross-validation, and comprehensive performance metrics.
