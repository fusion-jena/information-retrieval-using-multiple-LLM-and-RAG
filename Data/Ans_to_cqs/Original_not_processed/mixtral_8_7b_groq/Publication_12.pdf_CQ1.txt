Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about how raw data is collected in the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the details of the Waveman model, which is a deep learning model developed for processing and identifying tropical bat calls.

However, based on the nature of the problem and the context, it can be inferred that the raw data is likely collected using acoustic sensors or microphones that record bat calls. This is because the study aims to automate the processing and identification of tropical bat calls using deep learning approaches.

Additionally, the authors mention the use of "datasets" in the context of training the model, but there is no information on where these datasets come from or how they were collected. It is possible that the datasets were created by the authors themselves by collecting and labeling bat call recordings. Alternatively, the datasets could have been obtained from public repositories or other sources.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about how raw data is collected in the deep learning pipeline used in the study, it can be inferred that acoustic sensors or microphones are used to record bat calls, and the resulting recordings are likely used as raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The datasets used for training the model could be collected by the authors or obtained from public repositories or other sources.
