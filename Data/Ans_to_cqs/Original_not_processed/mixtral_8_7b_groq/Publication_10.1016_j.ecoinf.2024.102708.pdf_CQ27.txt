Answer:::

Based on the provided article abstract and keywords, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model for mapping the density of wild Pacific oysters involves the use of drone imagery and a specific model called YOLOv5s. 

The YOLOv5s model is a smaller model in the YOLO (You Only Look Once) series, which is known for its real-time object detection capabilities. This model was trained and tested for Pacific oyster detection, and it performed the best in terms of precision among the models tested. 

The TPH-YOLOv5, an extension of the YOLOv5s model with further pre-training on RPAS (Remotely Piloted Aircraft System) specific imagery, was also tested. However, the results indicated that the complexity of the larger YOLOv5m model is not required for Pacific oyster detection, and using the TPH-YOLOv5 model pre-trained with RPAS data does not provide additional benefits in this instance.

Although the article does not provide explicit details about the steps taken for model serialization and platform selection, it can be inferred that the trained model was saved in a serialized format to be deployed on a platform suitable for drone imagery processing. The platform could be a local computer or a cloud-based service capable of handling large drone images and applying the deep learning model for Pacific oyster detection.

In summary, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model for mapping the density of wild Pacific oysters involves training and testing the YOLOv5s model on drone imagery, serializing the model, and deploying it on a suitable platform for drone imagery processing.
