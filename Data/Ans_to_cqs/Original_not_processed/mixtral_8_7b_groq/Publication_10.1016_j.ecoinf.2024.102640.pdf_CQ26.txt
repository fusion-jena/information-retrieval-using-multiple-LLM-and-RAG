Answer:::

The provided pieces of context discuss data augmentation techniques used in the GreenCam model, such as random rotations, scaling, and flipping of images. However, they do not explicitly mention stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling as methods to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

In the context of the paper "Encoder-decoder with atrous separable convolution for semantic image segmentation" by Chen et al. (2018), the authors describe a method for improving the balance of the dataset by using data augmentation techniques. These techniques help the model generalize better without compromising the diversity of the dataset.

In the GreenCam model, the dataset is constructed by expanding the geographic scope of data collection to include a wider range of urban settings, including different types of green spaces and varying levels of urban green density. To address underrepresented classes and improve the balance of the dataset, data augmentation techniques are implemented.

Therefore, while the specific techniques of stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are not mentioned, the context suggests that data augmentation techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in the provided context include data augmentation techniques such as random rotations, scaling, and flipping of images.
