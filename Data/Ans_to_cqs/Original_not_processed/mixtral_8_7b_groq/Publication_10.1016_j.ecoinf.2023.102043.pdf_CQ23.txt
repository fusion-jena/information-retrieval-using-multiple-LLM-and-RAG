Answer:

The text provided does not give explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the dataset was divided into 70% for training, 10% for validation, and 20% for testing purposes. This is a common practice in machine learning to assess the performance and generalizability of a model. 

Additionally, the text mentions that the dataset is reconstructed based on the start times and durations of entities, and handles cases where the event is automatically associated with all the audio files that cover its start time. This could potentially contribute to the model's ability to generalize, as it shows an attempt to handle unusual or edge cases in the data.

However, other common techniques for improving generalizability, such as diverse dataset collection, cross-validation, and stratified splitting, are not mentioned in the text provided. Therefore, it is not possible to give a definitive answer to this query based on the information given.
