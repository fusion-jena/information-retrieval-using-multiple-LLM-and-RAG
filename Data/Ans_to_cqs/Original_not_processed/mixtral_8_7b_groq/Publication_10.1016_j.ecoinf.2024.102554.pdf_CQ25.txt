Based on the provided context, the specific details of the deep learning model's purpose are not explicitly stated. However, we can infer some possible applications given the context of aquatic environmental monitoring and satellite data interpretation.

The deep learning model could be used for classification, segmentation, or detection tasks related to the analysis of satellite data for aquatic environmental monitoring. For instance, it might be used to classify different types of water bodies, segment regions of high chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, or detect changes in water quality over time.

The context highlights the significance of Chl-a concentration estimation, which is a key indicator of water quality. The deep learning model could potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of Chl-a concentration estimation, particularly in optically complex waters of shallow lakes, as mentioned in the work by Binh et al. (2022).

Additionally, the deep learning model could be employed to analyze other biogeophysical parameters obtained from satellite image processing. With the vast amount of data available from various sensors like MODIS, Landsat, and Sentinel-3, deep learning models can help identify patterns, extract meaningful features, and generate accurate predictions, leading to better understanding and management of aquatic ecosystems.

In summary, while the specific purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that the model would likely be used for classification, segmentation, or detection tasks related to aquatic environmental monitoring, particularly for the analysis of satellite data and estimation of biogeophysical parameters such as Chl-a concentration.
