Based on the provided context, there are two post-processing decision rules applied after the model training to improve the performance of the model. These rules are defined as r1 and r2.

Answer: The post-processing steps involved after the model training include applying two decision rules, r1 and r2. Decision rule r1 is used to correct the raw outputs of the models trained with T2, T3, or T4, which are likely to recognize environment samples with a high confidence score. This rule provides the fish class with the highest probability as the final output when the first proposition of the network is 'environment' with a confidence score lower than 99%. Decision rule r2 identifies a part of a species as a correct answer when the result given by the network is "part of species X". No other post-processing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix are mentioned in the provided context.
