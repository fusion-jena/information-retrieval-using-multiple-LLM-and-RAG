Answer:

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning for object detection, specifically the EfficientDet-B7 model, but it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the TensorFlow object detection API was used, and the model was trained with a class number of 1, a batch size of 16, an initial learning rate of 2e-3, a momentum optimizer value of 0.5, and a step number of 400,000.

In general, deep learning pipelines often use optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSprop to minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance. These optimization algorithms update the model's parameters by adjusting the learning rate and direction of the gradient during the training process.

For instance, SGD is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the parameters by moving in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. Adam, on the other hand, is an adaptive optimization algorithm that adjusts the learning rate based on the historical gradient information. RMSprop is another adaptive optimization algorithm that normalizes the gradient by the root mean square of the historical gradient.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that one of these optimization algorithms was used, such as Adam, given the use of TensorFlow and the specification of the learning rate and other hyperparameters.
