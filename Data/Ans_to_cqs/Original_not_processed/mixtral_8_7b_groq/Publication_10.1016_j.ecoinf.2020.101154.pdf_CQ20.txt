Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text focuses on the use of Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) for modeling, including hyperparameter tuning, variable selection, and model performance evaluation. It mentions the number of iterations, learning rate, and tree depth as tuned hyperparameters, but it does not specify the hardware used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
