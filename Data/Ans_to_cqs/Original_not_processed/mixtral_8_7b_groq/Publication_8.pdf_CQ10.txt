Answer:::
I am unable to provide a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study mentioned in the context. The text provided does not include information about where the code for the project is hosted, if it has been made available at all. It is common for research projects to have code repository links included in the methods or supplementary sections of their published papers, but this information is not available in the provided abstract and keywords. If you are interested in the specific code used in this project, I would recommend reaching out to the authors directly or looking for any additional information they may have provided in the full text of the paper.
