Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no specific deep learning pipeline data repository link mentioned, such as a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, it is mentioned that the workflow is open-source and integrated with the DataMiner Cloud computing platform of the D4Science e-Infrastructure. The data sources used in the methodology are also listed, including environmental data from the Copernicus marine environment monitoring service (CMEMS), species occurrence records from the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS), speciesâ€™ risk level from the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), taxonomic data from the Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Information System of FAO (ASFIS), and global stocks or non-stocks in the fishing cells from the GRSF semantic knowledge base. These data sources are accessed and integrated through various standards and services, including the FAIR data principles, Catalogue Services for the Web (CSW) standard of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), and SPARQL endpoint of the GRSF semantic knowledge base. Therefore, while there is no specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline, the individual data sources and the open-source workflow are accessible and described in detail in the paper.
