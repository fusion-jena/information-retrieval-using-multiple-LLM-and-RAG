Answer: The text provided does not give a detailed explanation of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that consistent hyperparameters were maintained across all training instances, and an early stopping method was used to keep the model weights before the models overfitted. This suggests that some steps were taken to prevent overfitting, which can improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. Additionally, the use of multi-annotation campaigns involving both expert and novice annotators could be seen as a way to increase the diversity of the dataset, as it likely includes a wider range of annotations and potentially more varied vocalizations. However, the text does not explicitly mention techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are commonly used to ensure the model's ability to generalize. Therefore, while some steps were taken to promote generalizability, the specific measures are not explicitly stated in the text.
