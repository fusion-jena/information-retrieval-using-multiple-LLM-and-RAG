The context does not provide specific information on the criteria used to split the data for training the deep learning model. However, it is common practice in machine learning to split data into three sets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to train the model by adjusting the model parameters to minimize the mean squared error. The validation set is used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model during the training process. This set helps to tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. The testing set, which is independent of both the training and validation sets, is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

In some cases, the data splitting criteria can be based on a random selection of data points. In other cases, it can be based on specific criteria, such as time, location, or other relevant factors. The context does not provide enough information to determine if any specific criteria were used for splitting the data in this study.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific information on the criteria used to split the data for training the deep learning model, it is common practice to split data into training, validation, and testing sets. The criteria for splitting the data can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset.
