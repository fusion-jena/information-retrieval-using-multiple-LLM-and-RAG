Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the system being studied are not explicitly stated as being related to a deep learning model's accuracy, precision, or recall. Instead, the text focuses on various statistical measures and spatial metrics used to analyze geographical data.

The statistical measures used include the Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen's slope. The Mann-Kendall trend test is a non-parametric test used to determine if there is a monotonic trend in a time series, while Sen's slope estimates the magnitude of the trend. These tests are likely used to understand the significance and rate of change in the geographical data over time.

Spatial metrics, on the other hand, are used to quantify the spatial configuration of patches in the data. These metrics include the number of patches, patch area (sum), patch density (no. of patches / patch area (sum)), core area index (mean), contiguity index (mean), Euclidean nearest-neighbor distance (mean), radius of gyration (mean), and shape index (mean). These metrics help to describe the spatial distribution, size, shape, and connectivity of the patches in the data.

However, it is important to note that the specific context of a deep learning model's performance evaluation is not present in the provided text. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively answer the query with the information given.
