Based on the provided context, there are no specific mentions of post-processing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, the text does provide information about some steps taken after model training.

After training the model using the Pseudo Boolean Projection (PBP) method, the association coefficient between the new event (xnew) and each row of the transformed predictor matrix (P′) is computed. If this computed association coefficient is greater than or equal to the value of d*, it predicts that a new event will occur at the next time step. Otherwise, it predicts that it will not occur. The pred value associated with that row of P′ is then used for further processing.

The value of d* is chosen using k-fold cross-validation to optimize the accuracy of the method. The PBP method is compared with state-of-the-art machine learning methods, such as the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, in terms of accuracy, false positive rate, and true positive rate.

In the case study of predicting the threshold representing an outbreak for the aphid population dynamics, the accuracy values were higher than 70% regardless of the percentage of training using the original aphid time series.

The PBP framework provides a clear interpretation for each hyperparameter, allowing for the creation of visual representations of the patterns that occurred before the outbreak (the P′ means matrix). For instance, Fig. 7 displays the three patterns in P′ means obtained from employing PBP using the optimized hyperparameter values for the aphid data using 50% of the time series for training.

Therefore, the post-processing steps involved after the PBP model training include computing the association coefficient, making predictions based on the computed value, choosing d* using cross-validation, comparing the method with other machine learning methods, and visualizing the patterns that occurred before the outbreak. However, there are no explicit mentions of Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix.
