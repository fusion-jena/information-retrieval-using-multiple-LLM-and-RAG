Answer:::

I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context consists of various research papers and a table summarizing the hyperparameters of machine learning models for estimating water quality parameters. However, there is no mention of a code repository or any details about the computational environment or implementation of the models. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested link to the code repository.
