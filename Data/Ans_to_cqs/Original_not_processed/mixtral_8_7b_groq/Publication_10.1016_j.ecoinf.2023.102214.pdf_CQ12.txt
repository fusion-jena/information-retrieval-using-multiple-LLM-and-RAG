Answer: The specific type of deep learning model used in the snow leopard training pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model is likely to be a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), as CNNs are commonly used for image classification tasks and the context discusses the classification of snow leopard images. Additionally, the authors of the study mentioned in the context, El Abbadi and Alsaadi (2020), used a deep convolution neural network for vertebrate animals classification. Therefore, it can be reasonably assumed that a CNN is the type of deep learning model used in the snow leopard training pipeline.
