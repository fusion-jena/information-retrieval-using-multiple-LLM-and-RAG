Answer:::

The provided context discusses various deep learning models and techniques applied to different types of data, but it does not explicitly specify the data formats used in the deep learning pipelines. However, based on the descriptions, we can infer that the deep learning pipelines involve several data formats.

Firstly, the context refers to using features learned from raw trajectories for fish event classification (Beyan and Fisher, 2013a; Beyan and Fisher, 2013b). In this case, the raw trajectory data is likely provided in a structured format, such as a CSV file, where each row represents a data point with coordinates (x, y) and possibly other features like time or fish identity.

Secondly, Kiranyaz et al. (2019, 2021) discuss 1D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for signal processing applications. Here, the data format is one-dimensional signals, which could be time-series data like audio or sensor readings. These signals are typically stored in waveform audio file format (WAV) or CSV files for deep learning applications.

Thirdly, Knausg√•rd et al. (2022) mention a deep learning-based approach for temperate fish detection and classification. While the context does not explicitly mention the data format, it is likely that the pipeline involves image data, given that fish detection and classification are typically performed using computer vision techniques on images or videos.

Lastly, the context discusses diffusion models for unsupervised feature learning (Cao et al., 2024; Paoletti et al., 2021a; Paoletti et al., 2022b; Xiang et al., 2023). Diffusion models are often applied to image data, where the model learns to denoise and reconstruct images. In this case, the data format is image data, likely provided in a format like JPEG or PNG.

In summary, the deep learning pipelines discussed in the provided context involve various data formats, including structured data (CSV), one-dimensional signals (WAV or CSV), image data (JPEG or PNG), and possibly video data.
