While the provided context does not contain direct information about handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, it does offer insights into strategies for managing randomness in related fields such as ecological modeling and statistical computing.

In the context of ecological modeling, the study by Mi et al. (2017) used Random Forest, an ensemble learning method, to predict rare species distribution with few samples in large undersampled areas. Random Forest inherently handles randomness by introducing randomness during tree construction. At each node of the tree, a random subset of features is considered for splitting, reducing overfitting and increasing the generalization ability of the model.

In the R programming language and environment for statistical computing (R Core Team, 2021), randomness can be managed using the set.seed() function. This function sets the seed for R's random number generator, ensuring reproducibility of random number streams in simulations and models. Although this function is not specific to deep learning, it can be used within deep learning pipelines implemented in R to manage randomness.

In the context of variable selection in ecological niche modeling and species distribution modeling, the study by Cobos et al. (2019) performed an exhaustive analysis of heuristic methods. These methods often involve randomness, such as random subsampling of data or random initialization of parameters. By evaluating the performance of these methods, the study provides insights into the effective use of randomness in similar modeling contexts.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, it does offer insights into managing randomness in related fields. These strategies include introducing randomness during model construction, using seed values to ensure reproducibility, and evaluating the performance of heuristic methods that involve randomness. These insights can be applied and adapted within deep learning pipelines to handle randomness effectively.
