Unfortunately, there is no information provided in the context about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several sources that discuss the use of deep learning for crop pest image classification and detection, but none of them mention or provide a link to a code repository on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

There is a mention of a GitHub repository for a project called "Make Sense" by Skalski (2019), but it does not appear to be related to deep learning pipelines for crop pest detection. Similarly, the SmartProtect platform (2022) provides information about their pest detection and classification system, but there is no mention of a code repository.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as there is no information available in the provided context.
