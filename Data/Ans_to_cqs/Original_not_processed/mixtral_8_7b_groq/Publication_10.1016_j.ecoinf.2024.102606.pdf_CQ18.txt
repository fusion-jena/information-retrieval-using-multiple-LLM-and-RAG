Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of cross-validation, a technique that ensures the statistical validity of the model's performance and prevents overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex for the amount of data available, causing it to fit the training data too closely and resulting in poor performance on unseen data.

In the cross-validation technique used, the dataset is randomly shuffled and divided into a training and an evaluation set K times, creating K crosses. For each cross, a new model is trained on a different version of the dataset. Once all the models are trained, they are evaluated, and their performances are averaged to better understand the model's capability on the dataset. The similarity of each model's evaluation results indicates the model's correctness when predicting a species.

Additionally, precision and recall metrics are calculated to provide a more advanced evaluation of the model's performance. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made, while recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances in the data. A higher precision for a species indicates that the model is more confident in its correctness when predicting it.

The use of data augmentation transformations during training also helps monitor the model's performance. Data augmentation artificially increases the size of the dataset by creating new samples from existing ones, exposing the model to more variations and reducing the risk of overfitting. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with a low amount of data, as it increases the model's ability to generalize and its accuracy on the test dataset.

In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model's performance during training involves the use of cross-validation, precision and recall metrics, and data augmentation transformations. These techniques help ensure the statistical validity of the model's performance, prevent overfitting, and increase the model's ability to generalize and make accurate predictions.
