Answer:::
The provided pieces of context do not contain specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention various sources of data used in different studies.

In the study by Vanhoucke and Rabinovich (2015), it is likely that the authors used publicly available image datasets for training and testing their deep learning models, as is common in computer vision and pattern recognition research. Similarly, the study by Tan et al. (2019) on neural architecture search for mobile devices probably used publicly available image datasets, as well as possibly some proprietary datasets.

The study by WÃ¤gele et al. (2022) on a multisensor station for automated biodiversity monitoring likely used a variety of sensors to collect raw data, including cameras, microphones, and other environmental sensors. However, the specific details of the sensors and data collection methods are not provided in the context.

The study by Hu (1987) on the age and population composition of the giant panda used droppings collected in the wild as the raw data. This is an example of a more specialized and non-traditional source of raw data for deep learning.

The study by Ito et al. (2018) on estimating chimpanzee age based on DNA methylation used DNA samples collected from chimpanzees as the raw data. This is another example of a specialized source of raw data.

The study by Jalal et al. (2020) on fish detection and species classification in underwater environments used underwater video footage as the raw data. This is an example of a sensor-based source of raw data.

In summary, while the provided pieces of context do not give a comprehensive overview of the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, they do suggest that a variety of sources can be used, including publicly available datasets, sensors, and specialized data collection methods.
