Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it does mention that they used an "held-out test set" to evaluate the performance of their model. This implies that they have a separate test set that was not used in the training process.

In general, when training deep learning models, it is common to split the data into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model.

The exact criteria for splitting the data can vary depending on the specific use case and the amount of available data. A common approach is to use 60-20-20 split, where 60% of the data is used for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing. Another approach is k-fold cross-validation, where the data is split into k subsets, and the model is trained and validated k times, each time using a different subset for validation and the remaining k-1 subsets for training.

In the context of the paper, it is likely that they have used a similar approach to split their data into training, validation, and testing sets. However, without explicit information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
