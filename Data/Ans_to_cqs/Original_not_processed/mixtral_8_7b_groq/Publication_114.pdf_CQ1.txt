Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning methods for tree species diversity mapping using high-resolution RGB images and LiDAR data. However, it does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Nevertheless, based on general knowledge and the context's reference to remote sensing and fieldwork, we can make some educated assumptions.

Remote sensing is the primary method for collecting raw data in this context. Remote sensing involves the use of sensors mounted on platforms such as satellites, aircraft, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to acquire data about the Earth's surface. In this specific case, high-resolution RGB images and LiDAR data are used. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is an active remote sensing technology that uses laser light to measure distances to the Earth's surface, providing detailed information about the topography and vegetation structure.

Additionally, the context suggests that fieldwork is an essential component of the data collection process. Specifically, it mentions the importance of well-measured tree samples during fieldwork. This implies that ground-based surveys are conducted to gather ground truth data, which is used to train and validate the deep learning models. This data could include tree species identification and measurements, which would then be correlated with the remote sensing data.

Furthermore, the context hints at the use of public datasets, as it mentions the availability of benchmark datasets for training and testing deep learning approaches in remote sensing fields. These datasets are likely compiled from various sources, including previous remote sensing studies and publicly available repositories.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that remote sensing techniques, ground-based surveys, and public datasets are utilized. High-resolution RGB images and LiDAR data are acquired through remote sensing, ground truth data is collected through fieldwork, and public datasets are used for training and testing the deep learning models.
