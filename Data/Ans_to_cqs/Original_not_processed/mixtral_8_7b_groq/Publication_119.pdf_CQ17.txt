Answer:::

The text provided describes two regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline: dropout and batch normalization.

Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent over-dependence on any single neuron and promotes the development of a more generalized model. Although not explicitly mentioned in the text, dropout is one of the additional layers implemented after hidden layer 2, along with batch normalization.

Batch normalization is another regularization method that standardizes and normalizes the inputs of each batch, reducing internal covariate shift and improving the model's generalization ability. In the text, a batch normalization layer was added after hidden layer 2, which increased the testing accuracy of the model.

While L2 regularization is a common method for preventing overfitting, it is not explicitly mentioned in the text as being used in this deep learning pipeline.
