Based on the provided context, the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the R function "optim" to maximize the likelihood function of state space models. However, there is no explicit mention of the specific optimization techniques such as grid search or random search being used.

The "optim" function in R provides several optimization methods, including the Nelder-Mead method, BFGS method, and L-BFGS-B method. The default method is the Nelder-Mead method, which is a direct search method that does not require gradient information. It is a simple and robust method that can handle non-differentiable and non-linear objective functions.

Additionally, the template model builder (TMB) is used to fit the models to the rabbit time series data. TMB is a framework for building and fitting statistical models in R that uses automatic differentiation to calculate likelihoods and gradients. It can be used with various optimization algorithms, including those implemented in the "optim" function.

Therefore, while the specific optimization technique used for hyperparameter tuning is not mentioned, it is likely that a built-in optimization algorithm in R or TMB is being used. It is also possible that the authors have implemented a custom optimization algorithm.
