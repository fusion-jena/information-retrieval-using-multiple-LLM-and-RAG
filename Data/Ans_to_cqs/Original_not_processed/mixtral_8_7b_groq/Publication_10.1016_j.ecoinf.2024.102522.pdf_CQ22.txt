The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, as mentioned in the provided context. Accuracy is used to measure the overall performance of the model and is calculated as the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples.

In Table 6, the overall validation accuracy of the model is given as 75.68%, which indicates that the model correctly predicted 75.68% of the total input samples. Similarly, in Table 11, the overall validation accuracy of the model based on the human transmissibility index is given as 76.17%, indicating that the model's accuracy improved slightly.

Additionally, the model's performance in predicting "present" and "absent" sample points is also evaluated separately. In Table 6, the prediction accuracy of the model for "present" is given as 74.81%, and for "absent" is given as 76.55%. Similarly, in Table 11, the prediction accuracy of the model for "present" is given as 76.84%, and for "absent" is given as 77.55%. These metrics provide insights into the model's performance in predicting each class.

However, the provided context does not mention other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, or area under the curve (AUC-ROC), which are commonly used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive samples. F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and AUC-ROC measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.

Therefore, while accuracy is used to evaluate the model's performance, other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC could also provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.
