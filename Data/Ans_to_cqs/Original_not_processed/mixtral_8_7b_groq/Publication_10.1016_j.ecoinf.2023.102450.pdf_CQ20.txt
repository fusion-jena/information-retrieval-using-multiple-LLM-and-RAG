Answer:::

The deep learning model for wild animal tracking and identification was trained on a personal computer equipped with a 1060Ti GPU.

The use of a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is a common practice in deep learning as it significantly accelerates the processing speed compared to using a CPU (Central Processing Unit) alone. GPUs are particularly well-suited for parallel processing, which is essential for training deep learning models that involve large datasets and complex computations.

In this specific case, the 1060Ti GPU was used in conjunction with CUDA version 10.1, a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by NVIDIA. CUDA allows developers to harness the power of GPUs for general-purpose computing, making it an ideal choice for deep learning applications.

It is worth noting that while the context does not explicitly mention the use of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), which are specialized hardware developed by Google for machine learning tasks, the use of a GPU is a sufficient and common choice for deep learning model training.
