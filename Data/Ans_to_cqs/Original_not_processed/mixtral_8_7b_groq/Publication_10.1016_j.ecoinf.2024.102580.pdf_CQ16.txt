Answer:::
The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context provided is the validation loss plateau. In the figure 3, the training curves for the ground-truthed training and validation sets are presented. The solid line represents the training set, while the dashed line represents the validation set. The left graph shows the overall training loss curve, and it can be observed that the validation loss reaches a plateau, indicating that the model's performance has stabilized.

Moreover, the Generalized Intersection-over-Union (IoU) loss curve for training and validation sets is presented in the right graph of figure 3. The IoU loss measures the overlap between the predicted and actual bounding boxes, and it is a common metric used in object detection tasks. The graph shows that the validation loss reaches a plateau, indicating that the model's performance has stabilized.

In summary, the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context provided is the validation loss plateau, which is observed in both the overall training loss curve and the Generalized Intersection-over-Union (IoU) loss curve. Once the validation loss reaches a plateau, it indicates that the model's performance has stabilized, and further training may not significantly improve the model's performance.
