Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of a deep learning model being used in the comparison of machine learning models for predicting forest fires. The models mentioned include CART, Random Forest, and unspecified "machine learning algorithms," but no deep learning models such as neural networks are mentioned.

Therefore, I cannot provide the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model for this application, as no such model was discussed in the given context. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
