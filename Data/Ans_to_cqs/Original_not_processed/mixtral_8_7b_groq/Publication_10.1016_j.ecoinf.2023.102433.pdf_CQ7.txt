Based on the provided context, the text does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does provide information about the data subsets and the parameters used to retrieve data from the NASA web service.

When requesting a data subset using the `subsets` method, the user can specify several parameters, including `start_date` and `end_date`. These parameters can be used to select a specific time range of data, which could then be split into training, testing, and validation sets for a deep learning model.

Additionally, the `execute_many` method allows the user to retrieve data for multiple time ranges in a single request. This could be useful for obtaining a larger dataset to split into training, testing, and validation sets.

It's also worth noting that the `async_execute_many` and `async_execute_all` methods are asynchronous versions of the `execute_many` and `execute_all` methods, respectively. These could be useful for retrieving large datasets more efficiently.

In terms of data splitting criteria, common practices include randomly splitting the data into training, testing, and validation sets, or using a technique like k-fold cross-validation. The choice of data splitting criteria may depend on the specific problem and dataset being used.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it does provide information about retrieving data from the NASA web service, which could be used to create a dataset for training, testing, and validation. The specific criteria used to split the data would depend on the particular deep learning problem and dataset.
