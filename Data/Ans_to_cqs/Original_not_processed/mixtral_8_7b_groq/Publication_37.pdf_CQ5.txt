The text provided does not give information about the datasets used being similar to MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it describes a study that uses a dataset called CLO-43SD, which contains flight calls from 43 different bird species. The dataset is divided into 5 folds for 5-fold cross-validation, and the results are reported as a box plot generated from the per-fold accuracies.

The study compares the performance of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to a "shallow learning" unsupervised dictionary learning method and a baseline model based on Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). The CNN model is implemented in Python using Lasagne and data stream multiplexing is implemented using Pescador.

The CNN model is trained for 100 epochs, and a validation set is used to identify the parameter setting (epoch) achieving the highest classification accuracy. During training, the model optimizes cross-entropy loss via mini-batch stochastic gradient descent, and L2-regularization is applied to the weights of the last two layers with a penalty factor of 0.001. Dropout is applied to the input of the last two layers with a probability of 0.5.

Therefore, the dataset used in this study is CLO-43SD, which contains flight calls from 43 different bird species. The study compares the performance of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to a "shallow learning" unsupervised dictionary learning method and a baseline model based on Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).
