Answer:::

The provided context discusses the evaluation of domain gaps or shifts between training and testing data in the context of deep learning models for weed detection. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific evaluation metrics used for assessing the performance of the models in terms of accuracy, precision, or recall.

However, it does mention that the current evaluation metrics focus on image fidelity and reality, which suggests that some form of visual evaluation is being used. Additionally, human evaluation is mentioned as a strategy to measure domain gaps, which could include evaluating metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall.

In the figures provided, the performance of YOLOv8 and YOLOX models is evaluated in terms of weed detection accuracy, both in-season and cross-season. The error bar in the figures indicates the standard error over three modeling replications, which is a measure of the variability of the model's performance.

Therefore, while the specific evaluation metrics are not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in this study.
