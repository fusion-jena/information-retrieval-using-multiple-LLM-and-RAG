Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the Waveman project. However, it is mentioned that they trained a model using the training dataset (which includes 111,244 images) for 50-60 times using a GPU for two hours and 10 minutes. This suggests that they may have used a fixed number of training iterations or epochs to complete training, rather than using a metric like validation loss plateauing to determine training completion. This approach, while simpler, may not always result in the best possible model performance. It is generally recommended to monitor validation loss during training and stop training when the validation loss starts to increase, indicating that the model is starting to overfit to the training data.
