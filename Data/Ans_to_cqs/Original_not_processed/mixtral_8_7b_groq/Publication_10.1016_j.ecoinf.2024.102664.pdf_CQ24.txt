Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models for algal bloom forecasting in the Zhoushan fishery but does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.

A random seed value is used to initialize the random number generator, which is employed in various parts of the deep learning pipeline, such as weight initialization, data shuffling, and dropout regularization. By setting a fixed random seed value, researchers can ensure that the same sequence of random numbers is generated every time the model is trained, leading to consistent results.

In the context of algal bloom forecasting, the hybrid CNN-LSTM model was found to outperform other models in terms of Probability of Detection (POD) and Heidke Skill Score (HSS). The researchers used satellite data as an essential information source for machine learning algorithms. However, the specific random seed value used in the study is not mentioned in the provided context.

To summarize, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is a common practice to use a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This strategy is particularly important in deep learning applications, such as algal bloom forecasting, where consistent results are crucial for decision-making.
