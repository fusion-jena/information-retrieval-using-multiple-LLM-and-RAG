Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly specify the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that water quality and hydraulic and hydrological data are used as inputs for the CNN model. It also mentions that manifold features of the autoencoder are utilized as inputs for the CNN model. Given that water quality data and hydraulic and hydrological data are typically represented in tabular formats such as CSV files, it is reasonable to infer that the deep learning pipeline used in this study accepts data in CSV format.

Furthermore, the study uses a one-dimensional CNN, which suggests that the data is represented as a one-dimensional feature vector. This could be a vector of numerical values representing various water quality parameters, hydraulic variables, and hydrological variables.

It is worth noting that deep learning models can accept various data formats, including images, audio, video, and text, among others. However, the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline depend on the specific problem being addressed and the data available for analysis.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly specify the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that the pipeline accepts tabular data in CSV format, and the data is represented as a one-dimensional feature vector.
