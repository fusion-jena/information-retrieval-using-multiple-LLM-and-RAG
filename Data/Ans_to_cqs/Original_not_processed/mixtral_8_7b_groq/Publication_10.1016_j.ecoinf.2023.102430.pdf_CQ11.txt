Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context only gives details about the research conducted on using convolutional neural networks for identifying major triatomine genera using low-resolution images taken with ordinary cellphone cameras. The data sources used in the study are mentioned as Supplementary Dataset S1, but there is no link or reference to any online data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
