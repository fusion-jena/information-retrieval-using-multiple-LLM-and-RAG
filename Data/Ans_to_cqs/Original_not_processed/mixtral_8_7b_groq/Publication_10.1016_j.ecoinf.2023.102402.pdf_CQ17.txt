The provided context does not contain information about deep learning pipelines or regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context focuses on the use of Maxent, a machine learning method for species distribution modeling, and the parameters used in its implementation. Regularization in the context of Maxent is referred to as a "regularization multiplier" obtained from ENMeval analysis, but the specific method is not mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
