Answer:::

The context provided does not directly answer the query about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does give some insight into the types of data used in certain studies.

In the study titled "Water quality prediction using machine learning models based on grid search method" published in Multimed. Tools Appl. in 2023, the authors used water quality data from the Godavari River Basin in India. The specific methods used for data collection are not mentioned in the text. However, it can be inferred that the data was collected from various points in the river basin, possibly using sensors to measure parameters such as precipitation, temperature, and land use factors.

The land use factors mentioned in the context are defined as the ratio of the area of a particular land use type (urban, forest, agricultural, grassland, shrub land, and urban) to the catchment area. These factors are calculated using arcsine square root transformation of the ratios. It can be assumed that the data for these land use factors was collected through remote sensing techniques or geographic information systems (GIS).

In general, the methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline can include surveys, sensors, public datasets, and GIS. Surveys can be used to collect data through questionnaires or interviews. Sensors can be used to collect data in real-time from various sources such as environmental sensors, medical devices, or industrial equipment. Public datasets can be used to access large amounts of data that have been collected and made available by various organizations. GIS can be used to collect and analyze spatial data.

It is important to note that the choice of data collection method depends on the specific problem and the type of data required. The selection of appropriate data collection methods is crucial for the success of any deep learning project.
