The provided context does not contain information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. The text focuses on the optimization of Land Temperature Radiance (LTR) parameters for wildfire response detection using remote sensing data.

The optimization process described in the context involves selecting the best model proportion and parameters for different indices to improve overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient. This optimization aims to enhance the detection of burned areas in wildfires, with a focus on minimizing omission errors (unburned pixels mistakenly identified as burned) rather than commission errors (burned pixels mistakenly identified as unburned).

The kappa coefficient is used as a comprehensive evaluation metric for detection accuracy, considering both overall accuracy and the performance of various indices under a binary classification system (burned vs. unburned). The authors emphasize the importance of selecting the most appropriate index for a given region based on climate and vegetation cover conditions to provide meaningful results.

In summary, the provided context discusses the optimization of LTR parameters for wildfire response detection using remote sensing data, focusing on minimizing omission errors and selecting appropriate indices based on climate and vegetation conditions. However, it does not contain information about optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as SGD or Adam.
