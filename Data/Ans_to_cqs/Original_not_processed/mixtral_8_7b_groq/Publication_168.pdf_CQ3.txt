The provided context discusses the use of deep learning methods, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for Hyperspectral Image (HSI) classification. However, it does not mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this task.

In general, for computer vision tasks, data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Image-level annotation: In this method, each image is assigned a label indicating the class or object present in the image. This is the simplest form of annotation and is used for image classification tasks.
2. Bounding box annotation: In this method, a bounding box is drawn around the object of interest in an image. This is used for object detection tasks where the goal is to locate the object in the image.
3. Semantic segmentation: In this method, each pixel in an image is assigned a label indicating the class or object to which it belongs. This is used for image segmentation tasks where the goal is to partition an image into multiple regions or segments.
4. Instance segmentation: This is an extension of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented separately, allowing for counting and tracking of individual objects.

For HSI classification, the data annotation techniques used may vary depending on the specific task and the nature of the data. For example, for pixel-wise classification, semantic segmentation or instance segmentation may be used. For object detection in HSI data, bounding box annotation may be used.

Therefore, while the provided context does not mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for HSI classification, the techniques used in other computer vision tasks can provide a general idea. However, it is important to note that the specific data annotation techniques used for HSI classification may vary depending on the task and the data.
