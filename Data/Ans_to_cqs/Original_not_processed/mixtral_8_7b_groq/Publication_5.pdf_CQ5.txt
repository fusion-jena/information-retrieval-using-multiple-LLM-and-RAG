Based on the given context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the datasets used are related to remote sensing and forestry, as the studies focus on modeling vascular plant species richness using LiDAR data and drone images.

In the study by Lopatin et al. (2016), the authors used LiDAR data in a natural forest in central Chile to model vascular plant species richness. The LiDAR data was used to extract features such as canopy height, canopy cover, and vegetation density, which were then used as inputs for the deep learning model.

The study by Hakkenberg et al. (2012) also used LiDAR data to map multi-scale vascular plant richness in a forest landscape. The dataset used in this study likely includes similar features extracted from LiDAR data.

In the study by Zhang et al. (2016), the authors used remote sensing data for a technical tutorial on deep learning for remote sensing applications. However, the specific datasets used are not provided.

The study by Zhu et al. (2017) provides a comprehensive review of deep learning in remote sensing, but again, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipelines are not mentioned.

Therefore, while the specific names of the datasets are not provided, it can be concluded that the datasets used in these studies are related to remote sensing and forestry, and likely include LiDAR data and drone images.
