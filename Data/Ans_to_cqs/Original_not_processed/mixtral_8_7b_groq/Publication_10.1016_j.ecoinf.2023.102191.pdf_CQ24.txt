The provided context does not contain information about the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. The text is about a study on an app called Dive Reporter, which crowdsources biodiversity data from recreational SCUBA divers. The app focuses on standardization and collects metadata on location, number of dives, and number of divers to enable normalization based on sampling effort. The study also includes a question-based survey to assess the opinion of users on the app's usability and potential value for the diving community. The data collected over a 1-month trial illustrates the potential and value of the monitoring program. However, there is no mention of deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in the pipeline.
