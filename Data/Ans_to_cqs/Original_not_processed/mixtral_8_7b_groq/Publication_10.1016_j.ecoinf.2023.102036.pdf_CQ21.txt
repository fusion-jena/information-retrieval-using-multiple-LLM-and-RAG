Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The text mainly focuses on the model training process, including the optimization of the parameters and the use of Bayesian optimization.

However, it can be inferred that the model's performance was evaluated during the training process, as the training was validated every 300 iterations and TensorBoard was used to study the performance of the runs. Therefore, it is possible that metrics calculation was involved as part of the validation process.

Additionally, the model is intended for wildlife research, where identifying similar and dissimilar photos of individuals is crucial. Therefore, it is likely that a confusion matrix or a similar evaluation method was used to assess the model's ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar photos.

As for saliency maps, there is no information in the text that suggests they were used in the postprocessing steps. Saliency maps are typically used to visualize the parts of the input that the model is paying attention to, which can be useful for interpretability purposes. However, the text does not mention anything about model interpretability or visualization.

In summary, while the text does not provide explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, it is possible that metrics calculation and a confusion matrix were used to evaluate the model's performance. Saliency maps are less likely to have been used, but it is not possible to rule out their use entirely.
