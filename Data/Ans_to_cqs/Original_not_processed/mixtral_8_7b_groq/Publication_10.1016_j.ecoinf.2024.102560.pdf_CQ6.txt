Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, in the context of Rahimi and Breuste (2021), they used land-use data as input for their artificial neural network model. Therefore, it can be inferred that data preprocessing steps such as cleaning, normalization, and scaling were applied to the land-use data before training the deep learning model.

Data cleaning is an essential step in preprocessing to remove any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values in the data. This step ensures that the data used for training the model is accurate and reliable.

Normalization and scaling are also crucial preprocessing steps for deep learning models. Normalization is the process of rescaling the data to a range of [0, 1] or [-1, 1] to avoid bias towards features with large values. Scaling, on the other hand, involves rescaling the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This step ensures that all features have equal importance during training and prevents the model from being dominated by features with large variances.

In summary, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model typically include data cleaning, normalization, and scaling. While there is no explicit information about these steps in the provided context, it can be inferred that they were applied to the land-use data used in Rahimi and Breuste (2021).
