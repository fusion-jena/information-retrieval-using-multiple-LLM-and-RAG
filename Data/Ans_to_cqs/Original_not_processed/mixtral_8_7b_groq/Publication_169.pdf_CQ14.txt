Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text does not mention any specific techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.

However, it is worth noting that the paper by Loffe and Szegedy (2015) on batch normalization, which is applied to the model in the context, suggests a possible approach to hyperparameter optimization. They propose a method for automatically adjusting the learning rate during training, based on the moving averages of the gradients and the parameters. This method, called "learning rate annealing," could potentially be used in conjunction with other hyperparameter optimization techniques to improve the performance of the model.

Additionally, the paper by Purohit et al. (2016) on automatic plant species recognition using machine learning approaches mentions the use of cross-validation for evaluating the performance of their model. While cross-validation is primarily used for model selection and evaluation, it can also be used as a form of hyperparameter optimization, by searching for the best hyperparameters that maximize the cross-validated performance.

Overall, while the provided context does not contain explicit information about the hyperparameter optimization technique used for the model, there are possible approaches that could have been used, such as learning rate annealing and cross-validation. Further investigation of the model architecture and training procedure would be needed to determine the specific hyperparameter optimization technique used.
