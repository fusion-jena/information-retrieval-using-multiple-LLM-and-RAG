The text provided discusses a deep learning pipeline for acoustic monitoring but does not explicitly specify the methods used for collecting raw data. However, it does mention some sources of data used in the pipeline.

The pipeline uses a custom training loss to enable multi-label learning from single-label training data. The training data was collected from the study region, and the manual effort in training data creation was reduced by focusing on template creation and validation of template-based detections in a graphical user interface. This suggests that the training data was collected through targeted recordings in the study region, rather than relying on public datasets or crowdsourced data.

The study also mentions the challenge of geographic variation in soundscapes, which could require training data collected at a local or regional scale for high performance. This further supports the idea that the training data was collected through targeted recordings in the study region.

There is no mention of using surveys or sensors other than soundscape recordings for data collection. Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline for acoustic monitoring uses targeted soundscape recordings for collecting raw data. However, the specific methods used for collecting these recordings are not specified in the text.
