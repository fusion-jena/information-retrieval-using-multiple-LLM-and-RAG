The provided context discusses the use of random forest models in species distribution modeling (SDM) and does not directly mention the preprocessing techniques used in deep learning pipelines to address data bias. However, I can provide some general information about these techniques based on common practices in the field of machine learning.

Answer:::
In the context of machine learning and deep learning, data bias can be addressed during preprocessing using various techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling is a method of splitting data into training and testing sets while preserving the original distribution of classes. This technique ensures that each subset contains a representative proportion of samples from each class, reducing bias and improving model performance.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance class distributions in imbalanced datasets. Oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class, while undersampling involves removing samples from the majority class. These techniques can help reduce bias and improve model performance by ensuring that the model is trained on a balanced dataset.

Diverse data collection involves gathering data from a wide range of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population. This technique can help reduce bias by ensuring that the model is trained on a diverse set of samples, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving generalizability.

It's important to note that the specific preprocessing techniques used will depend on the characteristics of the dataset and the goals of the modeling project. In the context of SDM, the authors mention the use of cross-validation techniques, including random and spatial cross-validation, to evaluate model performance. However, they do not explicitly mention the use of any bias reduction techniques during preprocessing.
