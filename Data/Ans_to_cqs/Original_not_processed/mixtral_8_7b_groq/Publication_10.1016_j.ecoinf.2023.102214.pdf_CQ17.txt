Based on the provided context, the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization, are not mentioned. However, the text does mention that left-right mirroring data augmentation techniques were used to reduce overfitting and improve the algorithm's ability to match individuals based on pelt patterns.

Data augmentation is a regularization technique that can help prevent overfitting by increasing the amount of training data and providing the model with more variability. In this case, left-right mirroring was used to create additional training examples and improve the model's generalization ability.

While the text does not explicitly mention other regularization techniques like dropout or L2 regularization, it is possible that they were used in conjunction with data augmentation. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent over-reliance on certain features, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights and promote generalization.

It is also worth noting that the deep learning pipeline was trained for a relatively small number of epochs (10-30) compared to the typical range of 70-250 epochs. This could suggest that early stopping was used as a form of regularization to prevent overfitting. Early stopping involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training and stopping the training process once the model's performance starts to degrade.

Overall, while the specific regularization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, data augmentation and potentially other techniques like dropout and early stopping were likely used to prevent overfitting.
