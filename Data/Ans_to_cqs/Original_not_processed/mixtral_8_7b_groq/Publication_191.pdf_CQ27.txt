Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that deep learning models, including those used for plant species identification, typically involve multiple processing layers for representation learning. These models are trained using large datasets, and in the case of plant species identification, leaf features learned using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been found to be effective.

Once a deep learning model is trained, there are several steps that are typically followed to deploy the model. Model serialization is one such step, where the trained model is saved to disk in a format that can be loaded and used for making predictions. This allows the model to be deployed on different platforms or used in different applications without having to retrain the model.

Platform selection is another important step in deploying a deep learning model. The selection of the platform will depend on several factors, including the resources available, the required latency, and the need for real-time predictions. For example, a deep learning model for plant species identification could be deployed on a mobile device for use in the field, or it could be deployed on a server for use in a web application.

The context also mentions that the optimization capability of deep CNN networks can be further improved by going deeper, but this requires very large amounts of training data. Therefore, it is important to consider the size and diversity of the dataset when deploying a deep learning model.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model for plant species identification, it is likely that the process involved model serialization and platform selection. Additionally, the effectiveness of leaf features learned using CNNs for species identification and the importance of large and diverse training datasets for deep CNN networks are highlighted.
