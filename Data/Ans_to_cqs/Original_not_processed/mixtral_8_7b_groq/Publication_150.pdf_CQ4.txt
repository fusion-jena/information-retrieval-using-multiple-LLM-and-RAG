Answer:::

Based on the information provided, there are no specific data augmentation techniques mentioned for the deep learning pipelines of ResNet-101, Wide-ResNet-101, InceptionV3, or MnasNet-A1. However, the context does mention the importance of data augmentation in improving model performance.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the diversity of the training set by applying various transformations to the existing data. Common data augmentation techniques for image data include flipping, rotating, and scaling. Flipping involves horizontally or vertically flipping the image, rotating involves rotating the image by a certain degree, and scaling involves changing the size of the image. Other data augmentation techniques include brightness adjustment, contrast adjustment, and adding noise.

The use of data augmentation can help improve the generalization and accuracy of deep learning models by providing more diverse training data. This is especially important for models that are trained on small datasets or datasets with class imbalance. By applying data augmentation techniques, the model can learn to be more invariant to these transformations, improving its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

In the context of the models mentioned, it is likely that data augmentation techniques were applied during the training process. However, the specific techniques used are not mentioned. It is also worth noting that further advantages of data augmentation on convolutional neural networks have been explored in recent research (Hernández-García & König, 2018).
