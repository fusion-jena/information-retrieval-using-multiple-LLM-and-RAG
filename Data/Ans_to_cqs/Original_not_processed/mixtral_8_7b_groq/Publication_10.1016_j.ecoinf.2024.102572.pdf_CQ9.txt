Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The text does not mention any specific data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF in relation to this pipeline.

However, it does mention that the data is stored on Google Drive in CSV format. This suggests that the data may be available upon request from the authors or their research center, or it could be shared through a research institution's data repository.

Furthermore, the context indicates that the data is related to a study on forest fires in the Panhandle area of Florida, USA. The study involves the use of high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite images, machine learning techniques for land use and land cover classification, and the quantification of carbon emissions from forest fires. The data's validity is confirmed through published data ranges, and a Direct Application Programming Interface (API) in Python is used to retrieve picture data for forest fire point information.

Given this information, it is possible to contact the authors or their research center to inquire about the data repository. Additionally, it may be worth checking any research institution's data repository associated with the authors for potential availability of the dataset.
