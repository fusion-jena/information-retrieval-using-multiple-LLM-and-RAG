Answer:::

The source code and trained model for the deep learning method used in the study are available on Zenodo, an open-access repository. You can access the materials using the following link: <http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2562058>. This repository contains the necessary files and information to replicate the deep learning approach for counting wildebeest in aerial survey images. However, the raw count data from the survey and crowd-sourced data used to create the training sets are available in a different repository, Enlighten: Research Data (<https://doi.org/10.5525/gla.researchdata.732>).

In summary, the deep learning pipeline's source code and trained model are available on Zenodo, while the raw data and crowd-sourced data are available on Enlighten: Research Data.
