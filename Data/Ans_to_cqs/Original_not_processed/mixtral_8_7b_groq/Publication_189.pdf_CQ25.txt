Answer:::
The deep learning model in question is primarily used for object detection and instance segmentation. This is evident from the various sources provided. For instance, the model is built upon Faster R-CNN, a region-based convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for object detection ([3], [13]). Additionally, the model incorporates fully convolutional networks (FCN), which are typically used for semantic segmentation ([4], [12], [19]). 

The model, known as Mask R-CNN, combines the object detection capabilities of Faster R-CNN with the pixel-wise segmentation capabilities of FCN. It generates bounding boxes around objects of interest (detection), and for each box, it produces a mask that distinguishes the object from the background (instance segmentation) ([19], [20]). 

The purpose of this model is to provide not just the location of objects in an image (detection), but also a precise outline of each instance of the object (segmentation). This is particularly useful in scenarios where distinguishing between individual instances of an object is important, such as in autonomous driving where the model needs to identify and segment different vehicles on the road. 

The model is trained using a custom dataset created by scraping images from a fixed camera every hour within a fixed period each day ([1]). The images are then annotated for custom training ([2]). The model uses resnet 50 and resnet 101 as backbone structures, and it employs anchor boxes of varying ratios for region proposal ([1]). 

In summary, the deep learning model in question serves a dual purpose, combining object detection and instance segmentation. This allows it to provide more detailed and precise information about objects in an image, making it suitable for applications where distinguishing between individual instances of an object is crucial.
