The text provided does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that "high model accuracies" were obtained for most of the target vegetation types (VTs), and that pixels were reserved for independent model validation. This suggests that overall accuracy was used as a metric, but it is not explicitly stated. Additionally, the text mentions that areas dominated by target communities were digitized as polygons and split into calibration and validation sets, which implies that some form of cross-validation was used.

The XGBoostClassifier, a machine learning algorithm used in the process, can output various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. However, the text does not specify which of these metrics were used or reported.

In summary, while the text suggests that accuracy was used as a metric for evaluating the model's performance, it does not explicitly state which other metrics (if any) were used. Therefore, the answer is:

Answer:::
The text does not provide enough information to definitively answer this question. It is mentioned that "high model accuracies" were obtained, and that pixels were reserved for independent model validation, but it is not explicitly stated which evaluation metrics were used. The XGBoostClassifier can output various evaluation metrics, but the text does not specify which of these were reported.
