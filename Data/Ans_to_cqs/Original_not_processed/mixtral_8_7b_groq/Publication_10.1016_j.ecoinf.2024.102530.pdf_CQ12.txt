Based on the provided context, the study does not mention using any type of deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers in the described pipeline. Instead, the study uses a tree-based Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) for modeling and decision-making.

The tree-based FIS is a hierarchical structure of interconnected subsystems, where each subsystem's output serves as input for the next subsystem or the final decision. In this study, the tree-based FIS consists of three simple subsystems: Wth-FIS for weather, Topo-FIS for topography, and Prox-FIS for proximity. The output of these subsystems is then used in the Apis-FIS model, which has two input Prox-FIS and LCWT-FIS, and produces an output with triangular and trapezoidal membership functions and five fuzzy sets.

Therefore, the study does not use any deep learning models like CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers. Instead, it relies on a tree-based Fuzzy Inference System for decision-making.
