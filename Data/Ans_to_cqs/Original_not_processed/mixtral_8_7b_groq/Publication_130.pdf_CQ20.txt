Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it mentions that deep learning, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has the potential to revolutionize research methods in ecology, particularly for identifying individuals. It also discusses the importance of large, labeled datasets for training deep learning models effectively.

To train deep learning models, specialized hardware accelerators like Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are commonly used due to their ability to perform parallel computations, which significantly speeds up the training process compared to using only CPUs. GPUs and TPUs are designed to handle the large matrix and vector operations required for deep learning algorithms.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, it is common practice to use GPUs or TPUs for deep learning tasks due to their computational advantages in handling large datasets and matrix operations.
