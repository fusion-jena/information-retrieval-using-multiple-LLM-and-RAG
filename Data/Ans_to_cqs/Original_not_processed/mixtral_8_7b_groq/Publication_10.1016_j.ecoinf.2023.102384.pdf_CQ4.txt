Answer:::

In the deep learning pipeline described in the given context, the data augmentation techniques applied during the training stage include random cropping of square patches and horizontal and vertical flipping. The specific patch sizes experimented with are 256, 320, 480, 640, and 800 pixels. However, no mention is made of other data augmentation techniques such as rotation or scaling.

During the validation phase, the images of the validation split are divided into regularly spaced, overlapping patches using the same size employed during training. These patches are processed individually, and the overall output is reconstructed by combining the predictions from the patches. Subsequently, metrics are calculated over the complete image.

It is worth noting that the context focuses on the data collection and curation phases, specifically the generation of ground-truth required for the training phase. The ground-truth is derived from dot labels by leveraging distinct procedures depending on the specific deep learning model being employed. These procedures include generating bounding boxes by creating squares centered over the dots with a fixed side length, producing density maps by overlaying Gaussian kernels centered at the dot positions, and generating segmentation maps by superimposing dot-centered discs having a radius and splitting overlapping discs using a background ridge. The parameters used in these procedures are established based on the standard object sizes prevalent in the images.
