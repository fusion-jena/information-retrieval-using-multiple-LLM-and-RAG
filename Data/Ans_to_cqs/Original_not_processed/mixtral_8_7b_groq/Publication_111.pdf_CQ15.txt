Answer: The paper "GRU-DNN Hyperparameter Analysis for Marine Data Forecasting" applies the Adam optimization technique in the deep learning pipeline. The Adam optimizer is a method for stochastic optimization that is used to update the network coefficients during the training process. It is a popular choice for training deep learning models due to its efficiency and effectiveness.

In the paper, the authors use the Adam optimizer to train their proposed GRU-DNN model, which is a combination of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) layer and a regular neural network. The GRU layer is preceded by an input layer and followed by a fully connected layer, and the model is trained to minimize the Mean Square Error (MSE) loss function.

The Adam optimizer is chosen as the optimization technique for the GRU-DNN model because of its ability to adaptively adjust the learning rate during training. This is important for the GRU-DNN model because it uses lag features, which are previous observations, as inputs. The optimal number of lag features, or K value, is determined through a grid search method, and the Adam optimizer is used to train the model for each K value.

The Adam optimizer is a popular optimization technique for deep learning models because it combines the advantages of several other optimization methods. It uses the momentum of the gradients, similar to the momentum method, and the adaptive learning rate of the Adagrad method. This makes it a robust and efficient optimization technique for deep learning models.

In addition to the Adam optimizer, the paper also mentions other optimization techniques that are commonly used in deep learning, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and hyperparameter optimization libraries like Hyperopt and TensorFlow. However, these optimization techniques are not explicitly used in the deep learning pipeline of the paper.

In summary, the paper "GRU-DNN Hyperparameter Analysis for Marine Data Forecasting" uses the Adam optimization technique in the deep learning pipeline to train the proposed GRU-DNN model. The Adam optimizer is chosen for its ability to adaptively adjust the learning rate during training, which is important for the GRU-DNN model that uses lag features as inputs. Other optimization techniques, such as SGD and hyperparameter optimization libraries, are also mentioned in the paper but are not explicitly used in the deep learning pipeline.
