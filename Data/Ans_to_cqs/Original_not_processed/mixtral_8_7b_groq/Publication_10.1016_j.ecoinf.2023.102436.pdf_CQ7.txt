Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context focuses on the explanation of 3D spatial metrics and their application in evaluating restorative potential in urban designs.

However, generally, in deep learning model training, data splitting is a common practice to ensure the model's generalization and prevent overfitting. The data is typically divided into three sets: training, validation, and testing.

1. Training set: This set is used to train the model by adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the error on the training examples.
2. Validation set: This set is used during the training process to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance. It helps in tuning hyperparameters and preventing overfitting.
3. Testing set: This set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. It provides an unbiased estimate of how the model would perform on unseen data.

The criteria for splitting the data can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset size, and other factors. Common approaches include random sampling, stratified sampling, or time-series-based splitting.

In summary, while the provided context does not offer specific information on the data splitting criteria for deep learning model training, it is a crucial step in deep learning projects. The data is typically split into training, validation, and testing sets to ensure the model's generalization and prevent overfitting.
