Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it is common practice in machine learning to split the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to train the model by adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the error on the training data. The validation set, also known as the development set, is used during the model training process to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance. The validation set helps to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and performs poorly on unseen data.

The testing set, also known as the hold-out set, is used to evaluate the final model's performance. The testing set should be independent and not used during the training or validation process. The testing set provides an unbiased estimate of the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

The context provides information about the labeling time and accuracy of the FishInTurbidWater dataset, which is a weakly labeled public dataset. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with the training time ranging from 1 to 6.9 hours, and the testing time ranging from 4 to 94 hours. The context also provides information about two DNN models, a semi-supervised model for accelerating model development speed and a weakly-supervised model for accelerating development time while conserving accuracy. However, the context does not provide information about how the dataset is split for training, validating, and testing these models.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it is common practice to split the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.
