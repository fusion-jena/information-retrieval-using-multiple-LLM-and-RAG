Answer:::

In the context of deep learning for image processing and remote sensing, raw data is typically collected using sensors. Remote sensing involves the acquisition of information about the Earth's surface using sensors onboard satellites, airplanes, or drones. These sensors capture reflected and emitted electromagnetic radiation from the Earth's surface in various wavelength bands, which can then be processed and analyzed using deep learning techniques.

For example, the article "Thin cloud removal in optical remote sensing images based on generative adversarial networks and physical model of cloud distortion" by Li et al. (2
