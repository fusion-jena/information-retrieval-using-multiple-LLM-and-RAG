Answer:::

The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline, as described in the provided context, is the adaptive ADAM (Adaptive Moment Estimation). The adaptive ADAM is a method that combines the advantages of two other optimization techniques: AdaGrad and RMSProp. It is an extension of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization method, which is widely used in machine learning.

Adaptive ADAM calculates individual adaptive learning rates for different parameters in the neural network, allowing for more efficient optimization. It does this by maintaining two estimates for each parameter: the first moment (the running average of the gradient) and the second moment (the running variance of the gradient). These estimates are then used to update the parameters in the network using a learning rate that adapts to the historical gradient information.

The choice of the adaptive ADAM optimization technique in this deep learning pipeline is based on its ability to handle non-stationary objective functions and its robustness to noisy and sparse gradients. The learning rate of lr = 0.0001 was chosen for the adaptive ADAM optimizer.

In summary, the optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline described in the provided context is the adaptive ADAM, which is an extension of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method. The adaptive ADAM calculates individual adaptive learning rates for different parameters in the neural network, allowing for more efficient optimization.
