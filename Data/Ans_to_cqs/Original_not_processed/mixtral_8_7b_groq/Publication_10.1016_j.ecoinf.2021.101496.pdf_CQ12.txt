Based on the provided context, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was implemented for SPAD value modeling. However, the text does not specify the exact type of ANN used, such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer. Moreover, the ANN used in this context is not a deep learning model, as it only has two input nodes and one output node, with no hidden layers mentioned. Deep learning models typically have multiple hidden layers to learn and extract complex features from the data. Therefore, the answer to the query is:

The provided context does not specify the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The ANN used in the SPAD value modeling is not a deep learning model, as it has no hidden layers.
