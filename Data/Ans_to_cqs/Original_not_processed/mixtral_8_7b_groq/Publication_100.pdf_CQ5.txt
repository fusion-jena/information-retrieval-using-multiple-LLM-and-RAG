Answer:::

Based on the provided context, specific datasets used in deep learning for remote sensing and computer vision applications are mentioned. However, the widely known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet are not explicitly mentioned in the context.

For remote sensing applications, Rustowicz et al. (2019) used a novel dataset for semantic segmentation of crop types in Africa. This dataset was created by merging Sentinel-2 imagery with crop type labels from multiple sources. The authors evaluated and compared the performance of several deep learning methods using this dataset.

In the context of computer vision, the authors used various datasets to train and evaluate their deep learning models. For instance, Krizhevsky et al. (2012) used the ImageNet dataset for image classification tasks. Similarly, Szegedy et al. (2013) used the PASCAL VOC dataset for object detection tasks. Additionally, Girshick et al. (2014) used the ImageNet and PASCAL VOC datasets for rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation.

In summary, the context provides information on specific datasets used in deep learning for remote sensing and computer vision applications. However, the commonly known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet are not explicitly mentioned in the context. Instead, the authors used various datasets specific to their research problems, such as the Sentinel-2 dataset for crop type segmentation in Africa and the ImageNet and PASCAL VOC datasets for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks.
