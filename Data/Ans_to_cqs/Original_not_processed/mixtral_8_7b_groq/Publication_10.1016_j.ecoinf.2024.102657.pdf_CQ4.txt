Answer:

 The provided context does not explicitly mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling that were applied in the described deep learning pipeline. The focus of the process was to demonstrate the power of human-machine teaming by applying the least amount of preprocessing possible to the spectrograms.

 The preprocessing steps involved creating a metadata .csv file for the training set, which was identical in structure to the metadata file for the entire dataset. No additional preprocessing was applied to the spectrograms.

 To further validate the decision not to apply data augmentation techniques, the accuracy of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was assessed on noise-filtered data versus raw data. The results showed similar accuracy levels, with the CNN's accuracy on filtered data averaging at 99.22% and on non-filtered data averaging at 99.25% after 10 trials.

 Therefore, based on the given context, no data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling were used in the deep learning pipeline.
