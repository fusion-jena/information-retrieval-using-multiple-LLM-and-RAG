After training the model, there are several postprocessing steps that can be taken to further evaluate and interpret the model's performance. Based on the context provided, some of the postprocessing steps that were carried out include:

1. Generating confusion matrices: A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It compares the predicted labels to the actual labels and can provide insights into the types of errors that the model is making. In this case, a confusion matrix was generated for the model with an attention layer after training it with 150 epochs (Figure 6).
