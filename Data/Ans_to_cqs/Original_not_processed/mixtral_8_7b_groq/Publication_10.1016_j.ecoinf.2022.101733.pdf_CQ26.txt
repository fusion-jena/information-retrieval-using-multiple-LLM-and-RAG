The provided context discusses the process of sample selection for training and validating a remote sensing (RS) image classification model, but it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does imply the use of stratified splitting and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a sampling technique that ensures each subset (e.g., training, validation, testing) of the data is representative of the whole. In the context, it can be inferred that the total number of samples is divided according to a 60%-40% ratio for training and validation, respectively. This suggests that the distribution of samples is maintained in both sets, thus using stratified splitting.

Diverse data collection is also implied in the context. The analyst selected samples from different batches of Sentinel-2 data, including visible bands, multispectral bands, spectral indices, spectral features, textural features, and Digital Surface Model (DSM) data. This approach aims to ensure that the training data is representative of the various classes in the landscape, reducing the risk of bias.

The context does not mention oversampling or undersampling, which are techniques used to handle imbalanced classes in the dataset. Oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of samples from the majority class.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the following techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline:

1. Stratified splitting: Ensuring that the distribution of samples is maintained in both training and validation sets.
2. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources and bands to ensure that the training data is representative of the different classes in the landscape.

The other techniques, such as oversampling and undersampling, are not mentioned in the context.
