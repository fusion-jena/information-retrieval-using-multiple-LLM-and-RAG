The context provided does not give information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It mainly focuses on the sampling techniques and methods used to improve the accuracy of land use and land cover (LULC) mapping.

However, it is mentioned that scholars have used the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform for crop mapping in Canada (Davidson et al., 2020). Google Earth Engine utilizes large-scale cloud-based computational resources, which may include Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for training machine learning models.

In the study by Zhang et al. (2020), a hexagonal random-sampling strategy was introduced along with a tile model to improve the accuracy of LULC mapping in Madagascar. This suggests that the study might have used a distributed computing environment, where the training process is divided into smaller tasks and executed on multiple computational nodes. This approach can benefit from the use of GPUs or TPUs for faster computations.

In summary, the context does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. However, it can be inferred that the scholars might have used cloud-based computational resources, including GPUs and TPUs, for efficient training of their models.
