Answer:::

The deep learning pipelines discussed in the provided context use various data formats, mainly images and audio.

In the study by Krizhevsky et al. (2012), the deep convolutional neural network was applied to the ImageNet dataset, which consists of labeled images. This demonstrates the use of image data format in deep learning pipelines.

Lasseck (2019) focused on bird species identification in soundscapes, indicating the use of audio data in deep learning pipelines. Similarly, LeBien et al. (2020) presented a pipeline for identifying bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings using a convolutional neural network.

LeCun and Bengio (1995) discussed convolutional networks for images, speech, and time series, showing that deep learning pipelines can handle different data formats, including images, audio, and time series.

The study by Luther (2009) on the influence of the acoustic community on songs of birds in a neotropical rainforest further highlights the use of audio data in deep learning pipelines.

In the BirdNet application (Kahl et al., 2021; Wood et al., 2022), which allows for the identification of more than 3000 bird species, the deep learning model processes spectrograms of audio recordings.

Moreover, the study by Chen et al. (2020) introduced Vggsound, a large-scale audio-visual dataset, which can be used for pre-training deep learning models for audio-related tasks.

While the provided context mainly focuses on image and audio data formats, deep learning pipelines can also handle other data formats, such as video and CSV. For instance, video data can be used for action recognition, object detection, and other tasks, while CSV data can be used for regression, classification, and other tasks in deep learning pipelines.
