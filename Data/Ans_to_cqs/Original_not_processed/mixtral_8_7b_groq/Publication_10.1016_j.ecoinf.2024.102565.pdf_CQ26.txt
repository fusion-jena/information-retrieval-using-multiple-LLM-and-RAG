Answer:::

In the context provided, two techniques are mentioned to address data bias during the preprocessing of a machine learning pipeline: stratified sampling and random under-sampling (RUS).

Stratified sampling is a method used for dividing the dataset into folds during the K-fold cross-validation process. This method ensures that each fold is a representative subset of the original dataset, maintaining the same percentage of samples for each class as in the whole dataset. This is particularly useful in addressing data bias when classes are imbalanced.

Random under-sampling (RUS) is another technique used to tackle data bias by reducing the majority class in the training set to balance it with the minority class. In the given context, RUS was applied to the training set, while the validation set remained unchanged. This approach helps to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class during training.

However, other techniques such as oversampling, diverse data collection, and synthetic data generation are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Oversampling is a technique that balances the dataset by increasing the number of samples in the minority class. Diverse data collection involves gathering data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset represents the real-world distribution of classes. Synthetic data generation uses algorithms to create new data points that mimic the original dataset's characteristics, helping to increase the size and diversity of the dataset.

In summary, the provided context discusses the use of stratified sampling and random under-sampling (RUS) techniques to address data bias during the preprocessing of a machine learning pipeline. Other techniques like oversampling, diverse data collection, and synthetic data generation are not mentioned in the context but are also commonly used methods to tackle data bias.
