Answer:::

The provided context describes the use of several deep learning models in the pipeline, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers.

CNNs are mentioned in the context of the systems submitted to the public challenge, where four out of the eight systems use CNNs as their deep learning model. Specifically, the systems submitted by Tang et al. (2021), Du_NERCSLIP, Liu_Surrey, and Wu_SHNU (+Wu 2023 ICASSP) DFSL use CNNs. Moreover, the system proposed by You et al. (2023) (ICASSP 2023) also uses a CNN, specifically a ResNet.

RNNs are not explicitly mentioned in the context, but the system proposed by Wolters 2021 arxiv uses a Perceiver model, which is a type of Transformer that can handle sequential data.

Transformers are also mentioned in the context, specifically the Perceiver model used in the system proposed by Wolters 2021 arxiv. Additionally, the system proposed by Proto +RPN (R-CRNN) uses a CNN + CRNN + Perceiver model, which combines a CNN, a CRNN, and a Transformer.

Therefore, the deep learning models used in the pipeline include CNNs, RNNs (in the form of a Perceiver model), and Transformers.
