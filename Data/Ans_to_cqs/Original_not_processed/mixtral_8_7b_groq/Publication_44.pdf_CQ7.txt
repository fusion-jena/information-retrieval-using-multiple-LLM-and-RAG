Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the data was split into training and validation sets during the training process of the Faster R-CNN model for object detection. The model was trained for 3000 iterations, and the best performing model based on the validation loss was saved and used as the final model.

Additionally, a separate dataset was used for training a single-leaf classifier. The dataset consisted of 1015 intact individual leaves as positive training samples and 881 negative samples, which were manually extracted from the segmentation model results. However, it is not clear whether this dataset was split into training, testing, and validation sets for the single-leaf classifier.

It is important to note that proper data splitting is crucial for the success of deep learning models. Typically, the data is split into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and evaluate the model during training, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

In summary, while the specific criteria for data splitting are not provided in the context, it can be inferred that the data was split into training and validation sets during the training process of the Faster R-CNN model. Additionally, a separate dataset was used for training the single-leaf classifier, but it is not clear whether it was also split into training, testing, and validation sets. Proper data splitting is crucial for the success of deep learning models, and typically involves using separate sets for training, validation, and testing.
