Answer:::

The provided context discusses various aspects of deep learning models for image analysis and segmentation, particularly in the context of plant and morphological data. However, it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I will provide a general overview of some common techniques used to address data bias, based on my general knowledge in the field of deep learning.

1. Stratified splitting: Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures each subset (or 'stratum') of the population is proportionally represented in the sample. In the context of deep learning, this can be applied during the data splitting process (e.g., training, validation, and testing sets) to ensure that each set has a similar distribution of classes or labels.

2. Oversampling: Oversampling is a technique used to increase the representation of a specific class or subset in the dataset. This can be done by duplicating existing instances or by generating synthetic samples using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Oversampling helps to balance the dataset and prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

3. Undersampling: Undersampling is the opposite of oversampling, where the majority class is reduced in size to balance the dataset. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of the majority class or by using more sophisticated methods like Tomek links or Edited Nearest Neighbors. However, undersampling may lead to loss of valuable information.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting diverse data is crucial to reduce bias in deep learning models. This involves gathering data from various sources, domains, and demographics to ensure that the model is exposed to a wide range of variations and patterns. Diverse data collection helps the model generalize better and reduces the risk of overfitting to specific patterns present in the training data.

In summary, while the provided context does not discuss techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing, common methods include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These techniques help balance the dataset, ensure proper representation, and improve the model's ability to generalize.
