Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit description of a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, there are some details about how the models' performance was evaluated and hyperparameters were chosen, which can give us some insights into the possible monitoring strategies.

For linear regression, ridge regression, and SVC models, the authors performed hyperparameter search to identify the right level of regularization. This process involved training models with different hyperparameter values and evaluating their performance using accuracy or RMSE. This iterative process allowed them to identify the hyperparameter values that resulted in stable performance for each model.

For the evaluation of the models' performance, the authors reported accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, as well as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics were calculated for each defined class and averaged over all classes. This approach allowed them to assess the performance of the models for each class and identify any potential issues or biases.

In addition, the authors compared the performance of their models to other models, such as CLIP regression, Inception, and ViT fine-tuning. This comparison allowed them to assess the relative performance of their models and identify any potential areas for improvement.

While there is no explicit mention of a monitoring strategy during training, the hyperparameter search and performance evaluation processes suggest that the authors likely used some form of validation or testing to monitor the models' performance during training. This could involve splitting the dataset into training and validation or testing sets and evaluating the models' performance on the validation or testing sets after each epoch or iteration.

In summary, while there is no explicit description of a monitoring strategy during training, the hyperparameter search and performance evaluation processes suggest that the authors likely used some form of validation or testing to monitor the models' performance during training. This approach allowed them to identify the hyperparameter values that resulted in stable performance and evaluate the models' performance for each class and relative to other models.
