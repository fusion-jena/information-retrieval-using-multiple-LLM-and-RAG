Answer:::
I'm sorry for the confusion, but the context provided does not include information about the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. The text primarily focuses on comparing XGBoost and deep learning models, highlighting their differences in terms of data types, computational requirements, interpretability, and performance on small datasets. However, it does not delve into the specific hyperparameters of the deep learning models. Hyperparameters in deep learning can include learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, and many others, which are crucial for the performance of these models. Unfortunately, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional context.
