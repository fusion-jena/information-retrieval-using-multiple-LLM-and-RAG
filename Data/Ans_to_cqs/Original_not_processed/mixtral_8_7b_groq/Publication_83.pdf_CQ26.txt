The provided context does not give specific information about the data bias techniques used during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some preprocessing techniques used for handling multi-variate varying length audio data. These techniques include repeating the signal from the beginning to force a fixed duration of 2 seconds and directly resizing the audio image to a fixed size.

The context also provides information about the deep learning architecture used, which is a VGG style network trained using the Adam optimizer, categorical cross entropy as the loss function, and a batch size of 64 samples. The network is trained for 200 epochs.

Furthermore, the context discusses the classification performance of different methods using single CNN-based models and fusion strategies. The fusion of different CNN-based models often leads to performance improvement, but the fusion of more models does not always achieve better performance than fewer models. Different CNN architectures might have better discriminability in recognizing bird calls than different inputs to CNNs.

Therefore, while the context provides valuable information about the preprocessing and classification methods used, it does not directly answer the query about data bias techniques used during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
