Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves several steps and methods. First, the authors consider all available data for model-based integration, as the consideration of all data is one of the main points of model-based integration (Isaac et al., 2020). However, appropriate validation metrics can be less straightforward due to potential biases and differences in sampling methods. To account for this, the authors suggest using validation datasets that represent the niche and environmental parameters estimated by the integrated model.

Furthermore, the authors acknowledge that there may not be enough data available to reliably fit every type of model, especially given the demanding nature of some machine learning approaches (Isaac et al., 2020). In such cases, the package will raise warnings and highlighted messages to indicate that the provided information is not sufficient for inferring a species distribution.

To evaluate the model performance, the authors suggest using True Skill Statistics (TSS) or the "modEvA" R-package (M´arcia Barbosa et al., 2013), or by thresholding with minimum presence values, such as the minimum value across occurrence points, fixed or percentile values (Isaac et al., 2020). Thresholding to a normalized or percentile characterization of the distribution retains some of the detail of the projected suitability distribution while also removing uncertain areas and noise.

Finally, the authors suggest monitoring the model performance during training by creating suitability predictions subject to thresholds in binary, categorical percentile, and normalized outputs (Isaac et al., 2020). By using these methods, the authors can monitor the model performance during training and ensure that the model is accurately predicting the species distribution based on the available data.

In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves considering all available data, using appropriate validation metrics, thresholding to remove uncertain areas and noise, and creating suitability predictions subject to thresholds in binary, categorical percentile, and normalized outputs. By using these methods, the authors can ensure that the model is accurately predicting the species distribution based on the available data.
