Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, there are some details about the data and methods used in a study that could potentially imply certain steps taken to ensure the model's generalizability.

In the study "Why is Lake Urmia drying up? Prognostic modeling with land-use data and artificial neural network" (Rahimi, A., Breuste, J., 2021), the authors used the Consensus Mean of Precipitation (CMAP) dataset, which is a collection of precipitation datasets produced by analyzing gauge data and estimating satellite-based precipitation. The CMAP has a spatial resolution of 2.5Â° and a monthly temporal resolution. The authors mention that they downloaded the data from the NOAA repository, but they do not provide information about whether they used cross-validation, stratified splitting, or a diverse dataset to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model.

The authors also used Landsat satellite datasets to investigate water surface area and salinity variations over a long period of time (i.e., 1985 to 2020). They selected the most suitable data in terms of identifiability, which means they chose frames with cloud cover less than 10%. To minimize the radiometric effects, they performed radiometric calibration for the selected images. However, they do not mention whether they used these datasets to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model.

Therefore, while the authors used various datasets and methods in their study, they do not explicitly provide information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model.
