Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses a study proposing a compact network for adaptive image processing to predict parameters for image processing modules, improving per-formance of deep learning models. The study uses neural networks, trained through multiple iterations with optimization algorithms, to replace manual filters and extract ecological information from camera trap images. However, it does not mention where the data repository is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional context.
