Answer:::

Based on the provided context, I can identify two deep learning frameworks that are used to build models.

The first framework is TensorFlow. This is indicated by the presence of several TensorFlow-related identifiers in the context, such as "tf," "tensorflow," and "tf.keras." These identifiers are often used in code snippets when working with TensorFlow, suggesting that this framework is used in the construction of the deep learning model.

The second framework is PyTorch. Although there are no explicit mentions of "PyTorch" in the context, there are several indicators that suggest its use. For example, the context includes several mentions of "torch," which is the primary identifier used in PyTorch code. Additionally, there are several references to classes and functions that are specific to PyTorch, such as "nn.Module" and "optim.SGD." These are commonly used in PyTorch code for building and training deep learning models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it appears that both TensorFlow and PyTorch are used to build the deep learning model.
