The context provided does not give specific information about the deep learning frameworks used to build the models. However, it does mention that the study involves hyperparameter tuning, which is often done using automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques. Some popular deep learning frameworks that support AutoML include TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. For instance, TensorFlow offers a high-level API called Keras that provides functionalities for model building, training, and evaluation, and it also has a built-in module called TensorFlow Model Analysis for hyperparameter tuning. Similarly, PyTorch has libraries like PyCaret and Optuna that can be used for automating model selection and hyperparameter optimization.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly name the frameworks used, it is highly likely that one of these popular deep learning frameworks was used in conjunction with AutoML techniques for building and hyperparameter tuning the models.
