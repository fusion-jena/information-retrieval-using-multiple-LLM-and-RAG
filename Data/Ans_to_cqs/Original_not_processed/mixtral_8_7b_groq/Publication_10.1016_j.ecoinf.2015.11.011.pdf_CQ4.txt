Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling within the described deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the pre-processing and classification of imagery, including the use of the MRF basis for smooth function modeling and the application of the "false discovery rate" method for multiple comparisons.

For the classification of imagery, the context discusses the use of histograms for breakpoint analysis to determine thresholds, as well as the utility of different bands (e.g., green, infrared) and image properties (e.g., brightness, texture) for segmenting and classifying various images. However, it does not include any information about data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a specific answer regarding the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
