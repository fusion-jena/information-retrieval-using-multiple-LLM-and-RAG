Answer:::

In the context provided, the data is split into two main subsets: a train set and a test set. The train set consists of 4781 sites, and it is used for fitting all models. The test set, on the other hand, contains 400 sites and is used for testing the models' generalization capacities. These two sets are disjoint and randomly sampled.

The performance metrics for the models are calculated on both the train and test sets and then averaged over the 50 species in E50. This averaging helps to ensure the generality of the results and prevents bias from a specific category of species.

The train set is used for model optimization, where the model parameters are updated to minimize the mean loss. The mean loss is an important metric for the ecological model and is defined as the objective function that is minimized during model training. It is calculated as the sum of the mean squared error and the mean cross-entropy between the predicted and actual values.

The test set is used to evaluate the models' performance after training. It provides an unbiased estimate of how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data. By comparing the performance of the models on the train and test sets, it is possible to identify if a model is overfitting or underfitting the data.

It is important to note that there is no explicit mention of a validation set in the context provided. A validation set is typically used during model training to provide an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on new data. The validation set is used to tune hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, and to prevent overfitting. However, in this case, it seems that the authors have used the test set to evaluate the models' generalization capacities, which is a common practice in some machine learning applications.
