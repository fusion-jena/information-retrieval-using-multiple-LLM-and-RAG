Answer:::

The text provided does not give explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. However, it does mention that the training process involves the CNN adjusting its node weights based on the performance on the validation set, which implies that some form of iterative optimization is being employed.

In addition, the authors mention the use of early stopping as an optimization strategy to prevent overfitting. Early stopping involves monitoring the performance of the CNN on the validation set during training and halting the training process before the CNN begins to overfit to the training data. This technique can be seen as a form of regularization, which is a broader category of optimization techniques aimed at preventing overfitting.

Overall, while the specific optimization techniques used in the pipeline are not specified, it is clear that some form of iterative optimization and regularization are being employed to prevent overfitting and improve the performance of the CNN.
