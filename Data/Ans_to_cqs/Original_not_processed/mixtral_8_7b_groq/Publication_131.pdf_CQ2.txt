Answer: Based on the provided context, the data used in the deep learning pipeline is in audio format. The study focuses on the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the classification of anuran calls, which are types of sounds produced by frogs and toads. 

The audio data is preprocessed to create images that represent the audio energy of a certain record in a time and frequency graph. These images are then used as input for the deep learning algorithms. This approach is taken because it allows for data fusion to be done in a distributed manner, avoiding the need to send large audio data records through network links, thereby minimizing network power consumption. 

However, the original format of the data is audio, and it is transformed into an image format for the purpose of applying deep learning techniques. Therefore, the data formats used in this deep learning pipeline are initially audio and are then converted to image data. The final output of the model would likely be in a format that indicates the predicted class of the input audio data, such as a label or a probability score.
