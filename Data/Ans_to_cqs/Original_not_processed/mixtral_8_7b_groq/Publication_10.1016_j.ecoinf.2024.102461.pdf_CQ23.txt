Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the use of a deep learning model for fire risk mapping. However, the text does mention the use of three machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network, and Random Forests) for fire risk evaluation in a study by Nguyen et al. (2018).

As for the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, the context does not provide specific details about the application of techniques such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that fire risk maps were created using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices, which implies the use of a dataset consisting of satellite images and corresponding fire risk information.

In terms of validation, the accuracy of fire risk maps was assessed by dividing them into four susceptibility classes (low, medium, high, and extreme) using Jenks' natural break classification method in ArcGIS 10.6. This method aims to maximize the organization of a given set of values into distinct and meaningful classes, minimizing the variance within classes while simultaneously maximizing the variance across types. This can be seen as a form of validation, as it helps ensure that the fire risk maps accurately reflect the underlying data.

Overall, while the context does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, it does mention the use of machine learning algorithms for fire risk evaluation and the validation of fire risk maps using Jenks' natural break classification method.
