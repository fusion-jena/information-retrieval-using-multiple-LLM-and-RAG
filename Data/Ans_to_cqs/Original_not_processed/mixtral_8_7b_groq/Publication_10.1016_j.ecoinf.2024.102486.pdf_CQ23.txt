Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, I can provide some general measures that are commonly used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models.

Answer:::
Deep learning models can suffer from overfitting, which occurs when the model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on unseen data. To prevent overfitting and ensure the generalizability of the model, several measures can be taken, including:

1. Diverse dataset: A diverse dataset that covers various scenarios, variations, and edge cases can help the model learn a more general representation of the data.
2. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a model by dividing the dataset into multiple folds. The model is trained on one fold and tested on the remaining folds. This process is repeated for each fold, and the average performance is calculated. Cross-validation helps to prevent overfitting by providing a more robust estimate of the model's performance.
3. Stratified splitting: Stratified splitting is a technique used to divide the dataset into training and testing sets while preserving the distribution of classes or labels. This technique ensures that the training and testing sets have a similar distribution of classes, which can help to prevent bias and improve the generalizability of the model.
4. Regularization: Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Regularization encourages the model to learn simpler representations of the data, which can help to improve the generalizability of the model.
5. Data augmentation: Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of the dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data. Data augmentation can help to improve the generalizability of the model by providing more variations of the data.

Based on the context, it is mentioned that the most common use of GPU computing was in machine learning, where the training phase can be readily parallelized, and accessible software tools are available to utilize GPUs for this purpose. Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning models mentioned in the context were likely trained using GPU computing. However, the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the models are not provided in the context.
