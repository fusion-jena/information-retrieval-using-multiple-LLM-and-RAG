The text provided does not explicitly mention the specific evaluation metrics used for assessing the accuracy of the deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does mention two metrics used for evaluating the clustering performance of the model: ARI (Adjusted Rand Index) and AMI (Adjusted Mutual Information).

The ARI metric measures the similarity between two clusters, taking into account the chance grouping of elements. It ranges from -1 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates perfect agreement between the two clusters, a value of 0 indicates no better than random labeling, and a value less than 0 indicates worse than random labeling.

The AMI metric measures the amount of mutual information between two clusters, adjusted for chance. It ranges from 0 to 1, where a value of 1 indicates perfect agreement between the two clusters, and a value of 0 indicates no better than random labeling.

Therefore, the text suggests that the clustering performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using ARI and AMI metrics, rather than accuracy, precision, or recall.
