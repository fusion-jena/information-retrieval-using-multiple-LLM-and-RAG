Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain information on the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models. The context only mentions that deep learning strategies, such as neural networks, were used in a limited number of studies. However, it does not provide any details about the hyperparameters used in these models. Hyperparameters like learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, and number of neurons per layer are important aspects of deep learning model design and can significantly impact model performance. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this question without additional information.
