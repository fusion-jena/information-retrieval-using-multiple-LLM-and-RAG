Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, as described in the given context, include the number of neural network layers, the number of neurons per layer, dropout percentage, learning rate, and batch size. The number of neural network layers ranges from 1 to 5, and the number of neurons per layer includes 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, and 2048 (nth power of 2). The percentage values of the dropout layers are selected from 0.1, 0.25, 0.35, and 0.5. The learning rate has three options: 0.001, 0.0001, and 0.00001. Lastly, the batch size ranges from 32 to 256.

The optimization process of the model is divided into two stages. In the first stage, the neural network structure and the number of neurons in the hidden layers are adjusted, considering 60 sets of combinations, including one to five hidden layers and neurons with a range of 64-2048 (nth power of 2). In the second stage, the percentage of dropout layers, the learning rate, and the batch size are adjusted, resulting in a total of 192 combinations (4*4*3*4).

It is important to note that the optimizer is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, the optimization method used is the grid search approach, which is a traditional hyperparameter optimization method that compares the values of evaluation metrics for different parameters and selects the optimal parameters from the search space.
