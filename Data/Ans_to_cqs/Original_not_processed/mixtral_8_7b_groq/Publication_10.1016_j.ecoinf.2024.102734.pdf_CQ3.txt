The provided context does not give specific details about the type of data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of annotated data in the context of training classification models for sound event recognition.

One possible data annotation technique that could be used in this pipeline is audio event annotation, where human annotators manually label audio segments with the corresponding sound event classes. This technique is mentioned in the paper "How to Annotate 100 Hours in 45 Minutes" by Fallgren et al. (2019), which proposes a method for efficient annotation of large-scale audio data.

Another possible data annotation technique is unsupervised contrastive learning, where the model learns to distinguish between different sound events without explicit labeling. This technique is mentioned in the paper "Unsupervised contrastive learning of sound event representations" by Fonseca et al. (2020).

The paper "A machine learning pipeline for classification of cetacean echolocation clicks in large underwater acoustic datasets" by Frasier (2021) mentions the use of a machine learning pipeline for sound event classification, but it does not provide specific details about the data annotation technique used.

Finally, the paper "Koe: web-based software to classify acoustic units and analyse sequence structure in animal vocalizations" by Fukuzawa et al. (2020) presents a web-based software for acoustic unit classification and sequence analysis, but it does not mention the data annotation technique used.

Therefore, while the provided context suggests the use of annotated data in the deep learning pipeline for sound event recognition, it does not give specific details about the type of data annotation techniques used.
