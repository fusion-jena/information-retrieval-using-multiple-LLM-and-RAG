Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text focuses on the use of deep learning and machine learning algorithms for enhancing groundwater-climate interactions understanding, investigating climatic hotspots implications, and improving drought anticipation in the sub-basins of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) region.

Although the context does mention some techniques used in the study, such as linear interpolation for handling missing data, these techniques do not directly pertain to data augmentation in the deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are typically applied to images or time-series data to increase the size of the training dataset, improve model robustness, and reduce overfitting.

Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer regarding the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline of the study mentioned in the context.
