Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the model serialization or platform selection process for deploying the trained deep learning model. However, it does offer insights into some aspects of the training process that are relevant to the model's performance.

The DeepLabV3+ model was trained using a series of image blocks, each of size 32 Ã— 32 pixels, extracted from the original remote sensing images. This approach was taken to prevent memory overflow during training. The training set consisted of 70% of the dataset, and data augmentation techniques such as flipping, channel swapping, rotation, and noise addition were used to enhance the sample size and maintain consistency with the cropping approach in the model prediction stage.

The learning rate was adjusted dynamically using the ReduceLROnPlateau strategy. If the validation loss did not decrease after 5 consecutive epochs, the learning rate was halved. If there was no decrease in the validation loss after 10 consecutive epochs, the training process was terminated.

The model's performance was evaluated using various evaluation metrics, including Overall Accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient. The results were presented in Table 5 and Figures 4 and 5.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific information on model serialization or platform selection, it does suggest that the training process was carefully managed, with strategies in place to optimize the model's performance and prevent overfitting. It is likely that standard practices for model serialization and deployment were followed, such as saving the trained model to a file and loading it into a suitable platform for inference. However, without further information, this is only an assumption.
