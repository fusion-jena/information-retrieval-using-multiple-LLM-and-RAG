Answer:::

 Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link (e.g., Link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) for this project. The context mainly focuses on the study of the ecological source area (ESA) and ecological corridors (EC) in the Wei River Basin (WRB) using GIS and optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
