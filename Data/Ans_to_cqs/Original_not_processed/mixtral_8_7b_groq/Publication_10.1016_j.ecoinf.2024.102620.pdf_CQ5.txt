Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline mentioned does not seem to involve any of the standard image recognition datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it appears to be a pipeline developed for ecological research, using various datasets related to environmental and meteorological data.

The main datasets used in this pipeline include:

1. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data: The MOD13Q1.006 dataset, an L3 image product with a spatial resolution of 250 m, is used. The NDVI value is the monthly maximum value synthesized by the maximum value synthesis method.
2. Vegetation type data: This data is reclassified into nine categories: evergreen needle-leaved forest (ENF), deciduous needle-leaved forest (DNF), deciduous broadleaved forest (DBF), mingled forest (MF), shrub, grassland, wetland, arable land, and non-vegetation.
3. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data: The SRTM V4.1 dataset after resampling is used.
4. Temperature, precipitation, radiation, GDP, and population data: These datasets are obtained from various sources, including ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-lite/, https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/, and https://www.resdc.cn/.
5. Road data: This data is obtained from https://www.openstreetmap.org/.

The original spatial resolution of some of these datasets, such as the NDVI and DEM data, is considered too coarse and is resampled to a spatial resolution of 500 m.

The goal of this pipeline seems to be to analyze the relationship between vegetation and meteorological factors, as well as the impact of human activities on vegetation. The pipeline includes deep learning models for predicting NDVI values in the future. However, the specific deep learning models and techniques used are not mentioned in the provided context.
