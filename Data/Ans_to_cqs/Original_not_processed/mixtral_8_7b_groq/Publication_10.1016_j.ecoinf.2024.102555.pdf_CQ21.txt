Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, I can provide some general information about these steps.

Saliency maps are a way to visualize the importance of each input feature in making a specific prediction. They can be used to understand which features the model is relying on and to identify any potential biases or shortcomings in the data.

Metrics calculation refers to the process of evaluating the performance of a model using various quantitative measures. Common metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide a numerical value that indicates how well the model is performing and can be used to compare different models or to tune the parameters of a single model.

A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model. It compares the predicted labels to the true labels and counts the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. From this table, various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score can be calculated.

In the context of the papers provided, Sun et al. (2011) used MODIS NDVI data to evaluate ecological restoration through vegetation patterns in the lower Tarim River, China. They used remote sensing techniques to classify vegetation types and calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a metric of vegetation health. However, they do not mention any postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Similarly, Stow et al. (2004) used remote sensing data to study vegetation and land-cover change in Arctic tundra ecosystems. They used various techniques to classify land cover types and calculate metrics such as the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) and the leaf area index (LAI). However, they do not mention any postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, while these papers use remote sensing data and classification techniques, they do not provide information on the postprocessing steps mentioned in the query.
