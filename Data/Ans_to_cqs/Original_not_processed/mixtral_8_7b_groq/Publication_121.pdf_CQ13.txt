Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are the learning rate and the optimizer. The learning rate determines the size of the steps that the model takes while moving toward a minimum of the loss function during training. A learning rate that is too high may cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution or even fail to converge, while a learning rate that is too low may cause the training process to progress too slowly. The optimizer is a function that specifies the sequence of parameter updates during training.

In the model described in the context, the Adam optimizer was used. The Adam optimizer is a popular choice for deep learning models because it combines the advantages of two other optimizers, AdaGrad and RMSProp. The Adam optimizer adjusts the learning rate for each parameter separately, based on the estimated first and second moments of the gradient. This allows the optimizer to adapt to the geometry of the loss function and the distribution of the gradients, resulting in faster and more stable training.

The learning rate for the Adam optimizer was not specified in the context. However, it is common to use a learning rate in the range of 0.001 to 0.01 for deep learning models. The learning rate can also be adjusted dynamically during training, using techniques such as learning rate decay or learning rate scheduling.

In addition to the learning rate and the optimizer, other hyperparameters that are commonly used in deep learning models include the batch size, the number of epochs, the regularization parameters, and the dropout rate. The batch size is the number of training examples that are processed before the model's parameters are updated. The number of epochs is the number of times that the entire training dataset is passed through the model. The regularization parameters control the strength of the penalty for large weights, which helps to prevent overfitting. The dropout rate is the probability of setting a neuron's output to zero during training, which also helps to prevent overfitting by making the model more robust and invariant to the specific weights of the neurons.

In the context, a dropout layer with a dropout rate of 0.2 was added to the model to reduce overfitting. However, the other hyperparameters were not specified. It is important to tune these hyperparameters carefully to achieve the best performance on the task at hand.
