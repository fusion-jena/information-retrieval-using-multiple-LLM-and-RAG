Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several research papers and a table related to a species distribution prediction scheme, but none of them mention or provide a link to a code repository on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

The papers and table focus on topics like machine learning in Python, invasive species and ecosystem services, species distribution modeling, and BIOCLIM variables. However, they do not discuss the implementation details or code repositories for any deep learning pipelines.

In summary, I cannot provide the code repository location for the deep learning pipeline because it is not mentioned in the given context.
