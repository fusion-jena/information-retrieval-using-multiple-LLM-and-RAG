The provided context discusses various strategies used to prevent overfitting in model training, particularly in the context of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), but it does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, there is an implicit use of randomness in the data splitting process and the initialization of model weights.

To handle randomness, the data set is randomly split into two sets: a training set (80%) and a validation set (20%). This random splitting ensures that the model is trained on different data each time, reducing the likelihood of overfitting to a specific training set.

Moreover, the model weights are randomly initialized at the beginning of the training process. This random initialization allows the model to explore different areas of the weight space, increasing the chances of finding a good set of weights and preventing the model from getting stuck in local minima.

While not explicitly stated, the use of a random seed value could ensure the reproducibility of the random processes involved, such as the data splitting and weight initialization. By setting a specific seed value, the same random split and weight initialization would be obtained in every run, making the results more consistent and reproducible.

In summary, although not explicitly mentioned, the context implies the use of randomness in the data splitting process and the initialization of model weights. The use of a random seed value could ensure the reproducibility of these random processes.
