Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for algal bloom forecasts in the Zhoushan fishery. The focus of the text is on the comparison of the performance of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and hybrid CNN-LSTM models for predicting algal blooms, rather than the datasets used for training these models.

However, it can be inferred that the datasets used are time series data related to algal blooms in the Zhoushan fishery. The data might include environmental variables such as temperature, salinity, nutrient levels, and other relevant features that could affect algal bloom growth.

In general, when working with deep learning models for image recognition tasks, popular datasets include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. For time series data, datasets like UCR Time Series Classification Archive and Santa Fe Time Series Prediction are commonly used. Nonetheless, the context provided does not specify any of these datasets being used in this particular study.
