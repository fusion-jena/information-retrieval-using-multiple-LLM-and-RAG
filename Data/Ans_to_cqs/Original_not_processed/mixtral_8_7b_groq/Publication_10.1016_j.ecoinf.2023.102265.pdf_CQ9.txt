Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention or give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. It is important to note that the context focuses on the description and comparison of ResNet-50, ResNet-18, and ResNet-101 models, their training times, validation accuracies, and the use of ResNet-50 for feature extraction.

The context includes a visualization of extracted features using a pre-trained ResNet-50 CNN model and a comparison of training times for pre-trained ResNet-18/50/101 models. However, it does not provide any information about the data repository or data availability.

To access the data or the deep learning pipeline, it would be necessary to contact the authors or look for additional resources or publications related to their work.

Answer::: 
The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.
