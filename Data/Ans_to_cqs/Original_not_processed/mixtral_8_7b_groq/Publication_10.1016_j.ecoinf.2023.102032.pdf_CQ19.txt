Unfortunately, I don't have enough information to provide an accurate answer to your question. The context provided consists of an ecological informatics article abstract, a table, and a figure from a medium article about improving cloud detection with machine learning. None of these pieces of context mention or specify any frameworks used to build a deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
