Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of methods such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization techniques.

The text does mention that the neural network undergoes a learning process where its parameters are modified to optimize the classification rate. However, it does not specify how the parameters for this learning process are determined.

It is possible that the authors used a method such as grid search or random search to optimize the hyperparameters, but this information is not provided in the context. Therefore, it is not possible to give a definitive answer to this query based on the information given.
