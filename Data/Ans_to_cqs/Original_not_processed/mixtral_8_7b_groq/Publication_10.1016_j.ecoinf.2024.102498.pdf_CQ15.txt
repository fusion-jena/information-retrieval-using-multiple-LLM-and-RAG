Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The deep learning methods mentioned, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are highlighted for their effectiveness in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification, but the optimization techniques employed during their training are not specified.

Optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), and others, are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to update the model's parameters during training. These techniques help minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance. However, the provided context does not mention any of these techniques.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer this query accurately.
