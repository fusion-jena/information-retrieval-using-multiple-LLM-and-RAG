The provided context does not discuss the deep learning pipeline or the specific methods used for collecting raw data in this context. However, it does describe several methods used for creating probability samples in a geostatistical study, which could be a source of raw data for a deep learning pipeline.

In the study described, five types of spatial samples were created: simple random, systematic random, moderately clustered, strongly clustered, and strongly clustered, gapped samples. The moderately clustered sample was produced using stratified sampling, where the study area was divided into 100 compact geo-strata using the spcosa package. In each sample, 20 of the 100 geo-strata were randomly selected to form a stratum, and 50% of the total sample size was randomly chosen within that stratum. The locations of the remaining 50% of the sample were randomly chosen from the stratum formed by the other 80 geo-strata.

While this study does not directly address the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline, it does highlight the importance of creating probability samples for geostatistical analysis. In a deep learning pipeline, the selection of raw data can significantly impact the performance of the model. Therefore, it is crucial to use appropriate methods for collecting raw data, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets, to ensure the accuracy and generalizability of the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline, it does describe several methods for creating probability samples in a geostatistical study. When creating a probability sample, it is important to consider the study area, the geo-strata, and the sampling design to ensure a representative sample. In a deep learning pipeline, selecting appropriate raw data is crucial for the performance of the model, and methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets can be used for data collection.
