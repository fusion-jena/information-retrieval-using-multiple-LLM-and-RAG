Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a specific deep learning pipeline or a code repository link (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) for such a pipeline. The context discusses various topics related to data collection, processing, and modeling for species distribution, but it does not include any information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository.

The context does mention an R package for retrieving occurrence records from the GBIF repository, but it does not provide a link to the code repository. Additionally, there are several papers cited in the context, but none of them appear to be related to a deep learning pipeline or its code repository.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as there is no relevant information available in the given context.
