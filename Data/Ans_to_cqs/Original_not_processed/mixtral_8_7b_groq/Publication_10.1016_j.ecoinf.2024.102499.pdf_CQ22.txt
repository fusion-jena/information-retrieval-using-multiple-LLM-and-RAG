Answer:::
The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the metrics of recall, precision, and F-measure. These metrics are commonly used in the field of machine learning to assess the performance of a model, especially in object detection tasks.

Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified by the model. In the context of shark detection, recall would indicate the percentage of sharks that were correctly detected by the model out of all the frames that actually contain a shark.

Precision, on the other hand, measures the proportion of predicted positives that were correctly identified. It indicates the percentage of frames where the model correctly detected a shark out of all the frames that the model predicted to contain a shark.

The F-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which provides a single metric that balances both precision and recall. It is a more robust metric than either precision or recall alone, as it takes into account both false positives and false negatives.

These metrics are computed for each of the five CNN models that were built through cross-validation. The results obtained on models trained with only the three common shark species of interest are shown in blue, while the results obtained with models trained on 27 species are shown in green.

The correlation coefficients R were 0.88 and 0.85 for the video clips and one-hour video datasets, respectively, indicating a strong positive correlation between the predicted and actual shark counts. The correlation was highest for C. amblyrhynchos (R = 0.90), followed by T. obesus (R = 0.72) and C. melanopterus (R = 0.40) using the video clips dataset.

Overall, the deep learning model performs well in estimating shark abundance on both video clips and complete one-hour videos, as evidenced by the high recall, precision, and F-measure values.
