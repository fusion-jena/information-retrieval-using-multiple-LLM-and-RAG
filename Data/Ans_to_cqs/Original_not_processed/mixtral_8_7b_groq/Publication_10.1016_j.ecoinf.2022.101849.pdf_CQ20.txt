The provided context does not include information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text focuses on discussing various weakly supervised learning tasks and their differences, as well as introducing a new computational setting for regression in the context of predictive modeling of global vegetation cover.

The mentioned deep learning model is a part of the study by Chung et al. (2022) on weakly supervised multi-output regression via correlated Gaussian processes. However, the context does not provide details about the hardware resources used for training this model.

To answer the query, we would need to refer to the original study by Chung et al. or consult with the authors or relevant documentation.

Answer:::
The provided context does not include information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.
