The provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of image classification using Random Forest (RF), a machine learning technique. In the context of deep learning, data annotation techniques are crucial for training models for tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Some common data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a box around an object of interest in an image. The box defines the object's location and size, and the annotated data can be used to train object detection models.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel of an object in an image. This allows for the precise segmentation of individual objects, even if they overlap or are occluded.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling pixels in an image according to the category they belong to, such as "car," "road," or "building." This is useful for tasks such as scene understanding and image analysis.

In the context of the provided text, the data annotation technique used is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the images used for classification were pre-processed and labeled in some way to enable the RF classifier to distinguish between different categories.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query, it is possible to infer that some form of data annotation was used in the image classification process. Common data annotation techniques for deep learning include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.
