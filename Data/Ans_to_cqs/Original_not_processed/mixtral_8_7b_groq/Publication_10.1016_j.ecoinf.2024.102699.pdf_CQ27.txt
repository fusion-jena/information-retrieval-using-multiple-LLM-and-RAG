Answer:::

The text provided gives some context about the training of the models but does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the models were likely serialized and then deployed on a platform for fine-tuning.

In deep learning, model serialization is the process of saving the trained model's architecture, weights, and biases to a file, allowing it to be easily loaded and used for making predictions on new data. The text mentions that the ViT models were fine-tuned, which implies that the models were previously trained and then fine-tuned for a specific task. Therefore, it is likely that the trained models were serialized before being deployed for fine-tuning.

The text also mentions that the ViT models were fine-tuned using ImageNet-based weights for pretraining. This suggests that the models were deployed on a platform that supports transfer learning, where a pre-trained model is used as a starting point for a new task. Transfer learning is a common technique used in deep learning to improve the performance of models on small datasets.

However, the specific platform used for deploying the models is not mentioned in the text. It could be a local machine, a cloud-based platform, or a specialized hardware for deep learning.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the models were likely serialized and then deployed on a platform that supports transfer learning for fine-tuning.
