Answer:::

The performance of the deep learning models in the given context is evaluated using the classification accuracy metric. This metric is used to measure the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of input samples. In the case of encrypted images, the training, validation, and prediction accuracies are reported for each of the five CNN models, including VGG16, Xception, ResNet50, DenseNet121, and the proposed model.

For instance, DenseNet121 achieved the best training accuracy of 93.36% among the four pre-trained models, while the proposed model showed the highest training accuracy of 94.04%. Similarly, the validation and prediction accuracies are presented in Table 9 for each model, offering a comprehensive comparison of their performance on encrypted images.

It is important to note that other performance metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC), are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, accuracy is a common and suitable metric for evaluating image classification tasks, especially when dealing with balanced datasets. Nonetheless, reporting additional metrics could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the models' performance, particularly for imbalanced datasets.
