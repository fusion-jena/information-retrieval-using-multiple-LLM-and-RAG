The provided context does not give specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for landslide susceptibility modeling (LSM). However, it does mention the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) in a broader investigation of ensemble techniques and deep learning models for LSM.

In general, data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines include Flipping, Rotating, and Scaling. These techniques are used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize.

Flipping involves creating new samples by horizontally or vertically flipping the existing images in the dataset. This helps the model to learn features that are invariant to the direction of the image.

Rotating involves creating new samples by rotating the existing images in the dataset by a certain angle. This helps the model to learn features that are invariant to the orientation of the image.

Scaling involves creating new samples by resizing the existing images in the dataset. This helps the model to learn features that are invariant to the scale of the image.

Other data augmentation techniques that can be used in deep learning pipelines for LSM include:

* Translation: creating new samples by shifting the existing images in the dataset horizontally or vertically.
* Brightness and Contrast Adjustment: creating new samples by adjusting the brightness and contrast of the existing images in the dataset.
* Adding Noise: creating new samples by adding Gaussian noise or salt and pepper noise to the existing images in the dataset.

It's important to note that the choice of data augmentation techniques will depend on the specific problem and dataset being used. It's also important to note that data augmentation should be used judiciously, as excessive data augmentation can lead to overfitting and poor generalization.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for LSM, it is common to use techniques such as Flipping, Rotating, and Scaling to artificially increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize.
