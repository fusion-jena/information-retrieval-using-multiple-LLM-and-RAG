Answer:::
The provided context does not specify the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the pipeline. The text describes a species distribution modeling process that involves feature classes 'L', 'Q', 'LQ', 'LQP' and regularization multipliers ranging from 0.5 to 5. The evaluation of the models is based on the Akaike minimum information criterion (delta.AICc), Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), and Continuous Boyce Index (CBI). The final optimal parameters were identified as the feature class 'LQP' and a regularization multiplier of 3.5. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in this pipeline based on the given context.
