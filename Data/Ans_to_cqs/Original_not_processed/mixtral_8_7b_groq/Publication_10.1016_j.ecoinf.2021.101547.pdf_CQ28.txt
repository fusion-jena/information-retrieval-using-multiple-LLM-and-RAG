Answer:::

The provided context does not specify which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that the deep learning-related operations were performed in MATLAB 2020b equipped with the Image Processing, Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Parallel Computing toolboxes. The CNN training and image classification operations were processed on a GeForce RTX 2070 Super graphics processing unit (GPU) with 8 GB of memory. However, it does not mention any cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
