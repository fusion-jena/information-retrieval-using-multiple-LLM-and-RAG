Answer:::

The two metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in the provided context are the coefficients of determination (R2) and the root mean squared error (RMSE). 

The R2 metric, calculated as the squared Pearson's correlation coefficient, measures the percentage of variation in the response variable explained by the model. It indicates how well the model fits the data, with values closer to 1 indicating a better fit.

The RMSE metric, on the other hand, measures the differences between the actual and predicted values. It is calculated as the square root of the mean of the squared differences between the actual and predicted values. A lower RMSE value indicates better model predictions, as it implies that the model's predictions are closer to the actual values.

These two metrics, R2 and RMSE, are commonly used in regression problems, such as the one described in the context. They provide a balanced evaluation of the model's performance, as R2 measures the proportion of variance explained by the model, while RMSE measures the absolute differences between the actual and predicted values.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention other metrics commonly used in evaluating machine learning models, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score. These metrics are typically used in classification problems, where the model's output is a categorical variable. However, in this case, the model's output is a continuous variable, making R2 and RMSE more appropriate metrics for evaluation.
