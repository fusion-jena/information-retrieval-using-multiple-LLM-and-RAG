Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline for water or waste disposal rate estimation, and no code repository link has been given in any of the papers or abstracts mentioned.

The papers and abstracts discuss various applications of machine learning and remote sensing techniques for water quality and waste disposal rate estimation. For instance, Vu et al., 2022, analyze input set characteristics and variances on k-fold cross-validation for a recurrent neural network model on waste disposal rate estimation. Wainer and Cawley, 2021, discuss nested cross-validation when selecting classifiers. Wang et al., 2022, apply VNIR and machine learning technologies to predict heavy metals in soil and pollution indices in mining areas. Sajib et al., 2024, assess water quality of an ecologically critical urban canal incorporating machine learning approaches. Sakaa et al., 2022, model water quality index using random forest and improved SMO algorithm for support vector machine.

However, none of the papers provide a code repository link for their deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline related to water or waste disposal rate estimation based on the given context.
