Answer:::

The hyperparameters of the model were optimized using two methods: random search and grid search. First, a random search was performed to identify an optimal parameter set, where 100 sets were sampled and compared using three-fold cross validation. The search parameters included the number of trees (ranging from 200 to 800, by 100), minimum samples split (2-4), minimum samples per leaf (2-4), maximum depth (set to 'full'), bootstrap (set to true), and maximum features for split (set to the square root of the number of features). These results were then refined using a grid-search with the parameter ranges set to ±50 for the number of estimators and ±1 for the other parameters.
