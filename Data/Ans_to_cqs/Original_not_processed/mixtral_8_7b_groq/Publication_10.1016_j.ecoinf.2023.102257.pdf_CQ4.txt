Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that object detection models are used to filter empty images by localizing target objects within an image. This implies that some data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling might have been applied to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's ability to detect objects in different orientations and scales.

For instance, flipping is a common data augmentation technique used to increase the size of the training dataset by creating horizontally or vertically flipped versions of the original images. This helps the model to learn symmetrical features of the objects and improve its performance.

Similarly, rotating is another data augmentation technique used to simulate different perspectives of the objects in the images. By rotating the images, the model can learn to detect objects at different angles, which can be useful in real-world scenarios where objects may not always be facing the camera directly.

Scaling is another data augmentation technique used to adjust the size of the objects within the images. This helps the model to learn to detect objects of different sizes and scales, which can be useful in wildlife monitoring scenarios where animals may appear at different distances from the camera.

Therefore, while the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned in the provided context, it is reasonable to assume that some or all of these techniques (flipping, rotating, and scaling) were applied to improve the model's ability to detect objects within the images and filter out empty images.
