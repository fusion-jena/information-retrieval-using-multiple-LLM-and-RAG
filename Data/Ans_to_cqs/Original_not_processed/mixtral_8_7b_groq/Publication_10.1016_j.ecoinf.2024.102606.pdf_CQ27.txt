Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, I can describe a typical process that would likely be used, based on common practices in the field.

Once the model has been trained and validated, the first step in deployment is often to serialize the model. Model serialization involves saving the model's architecture, learned parameters, and other relevant information to a file on disk. This file can then be used to recreate the model at a later time, without needing to retrain the model from scratch. There are many libraries and frameworks available for model serialization, with different formats and levels of compatibility.

After the model has been serialized, the next step is to choose a platform for deployment. The choice of platform will depend on a variety of factors, including the intended use case, the required level of performance, and the available resources. Some common platforms for deep learning model deployment include:

* Cloud services, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which offer scalable computing resources and easy integration with other tools and services.
* Edge devices, such as smartphones, embedded systems, or Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which require lightweight models that can run efficiently on limited hardware.
* Custom hardware, such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which offer high performance and low power consumption for specific tasks.

Once the platform has been chosen, the next step is to integrate the serialized model into the target environment. This may involve writing custom code to load the model, preprocess input data, run inference, and postprocess output data. It may also involve optimizing the model for the target platform, using techniques such as quantization, pruning, or distillation.

Finally, the deployed model should be monitored and maintained over time, to ensure that it continues to perform well and meet the desired requirements. This may involve tracking metrics such as accuracy, latency, and throughput, and periodically retraining the model with new data to adapt to changing conditions.
