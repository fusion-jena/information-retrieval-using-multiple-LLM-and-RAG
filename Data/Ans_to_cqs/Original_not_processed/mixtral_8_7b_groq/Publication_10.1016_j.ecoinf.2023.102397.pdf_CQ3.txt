Answer:::

The provided context does not include specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of manual validations for song recordings in a study by Bicudo et al. (2023).

In the study by Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020), they used a deep learning approach to species distribution modeling and analyzed the effect of sample size on the performance of the model. They increased the number of hidden layers in the neural network, which can be interpreted as adding more training recordings in their software. However, the specific method of data annotation is not mentioned.

In the study by Brown et al. (2019), they developed a software for automatic rain and cicada chorus filtering of bird acoustic data. The method of data annotation is not specified in the context.

In the study by Brumm (2006), the author analyzed the signalling behavior of nightingales and their short-term adjustment of song timing to avoid interspecific competition. However, the method of data annotation is not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not clear. Data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, and manual validations are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for image and audio data. However, the context does not specify which of these techniques were used in the studies mentioned.
