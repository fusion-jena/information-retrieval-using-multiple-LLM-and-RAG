Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context mainly focuses on the criterion for multi-scale feature map selection and hard negative mining during the training phase of a residual neural network.

However, it is important to note that postprocessing steps can vary depending on the specific task and the requirements of the project. In general, after training a model, some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Saliency maps: These are visualizations of the parts of the input image that the model finds most important for its prediction. Saliency maps can help in understanding the model's decision-making process and identifying any potential biases or weaknesses.

2. Metrics calculation: This involves computing various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess the performance of the model. These metrics can provide insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses and help in identifying areas for improvement.

3. Confusion matrix: This is a table that summarizes the predictions made by the model, showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. The confusion matrix can be used to calculate various evaluation metrics and gain insights into the model's performance.

4. Model interpretation techniques: These techniques can help in understanding the model's decision-making process and identifying any potential biases or weaknesses. Examples include SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations), and feature importance analysis.

5. Model deployment: This involves deploying the trained model in a production environment, where it can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data. Model deployment may require additional steps, such as model compression, to ensure that the model can run efficiently on the target hardware.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention any specific postprocessing steps after the model training, common postprocessing steps include saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix, model interpretation techniques, and model deployment. The specific postprocessing steps used may depend on the task and the requirements of the project.
