The provided context does not contain information about deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. The text focuses on a decision support tool for stormwater best management practices (BMPs) to mitigate nutrient pollution and promote environmental justice.

The tool integrates various factors, including nutrient removal and environmental justice metrics. It calculates environmental justice indices based on racial/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and social vulnerability. The tool aims to democratize access to critical information and empower diverse stakeholders in decision-making processes.

While the text does mention the use of a Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), these are not directly related to deep learning or handling randomness in deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
