Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the investigation of plant species cover. The text focuses on the methods and setup of the deep learning model, including the use of a ResNet50 and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) for semantic segmentation. It also mentions the use of specific loss functions, batch sizes, and data augmentation techniques during training. However, there is no information about where the code for this pipeline is hosted or made available for public access. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
