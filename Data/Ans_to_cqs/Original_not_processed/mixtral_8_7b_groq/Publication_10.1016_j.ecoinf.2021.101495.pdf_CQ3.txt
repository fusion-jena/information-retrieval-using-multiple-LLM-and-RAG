Answer:

The data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline involve manual annotation by experienced analysts. This process includes delineating and assigning each fish to a class. The annotation method used is instance segmentation, which involves separating each fish instance from the background and other fish instances. This is evident in Figure 3, which shows individual fishes once the segmentation is done. The fishes in the figure belong to a monospecific set of YFT.

For manual annotation, 100 images from four different fishing sets were annotated, obtaining a total of 975 individual fishes (segments). However, for the training of the neural networks, a larger dataset was required. Therefore, data augmentation was used to increase the dataset size by a factor of 12, resulting in a total of 14,896 images.

It is important to note that the annotations were used for two different models trained with these data: one for automatic fish segmentation and another for classification by species of these segments. The search space and best assignments of hyperparameters of these neural networks are provided in Table 2. The base models for both segmentation and classification were obtained from TensorFlow Object Detection API and the base implementation of TensorFlow, respectively. The hyperparameters used for the training of each neural network include epochs, batch size, learning rate, activation, and train/test split. The best assignment for segmentation includes 15,000 epochs, a batch size of 2, a learning rate of 0.008, Softmax activation, and a train/test split of 0.9/0.1. For classification, the best assignment includes 500 epochs, a batch size of 128, a learning rate of 0.0001, Softmax activation, and a train/test split of 0.8/0.2.
