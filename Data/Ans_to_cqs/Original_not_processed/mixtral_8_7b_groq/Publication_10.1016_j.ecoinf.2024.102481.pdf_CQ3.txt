The provided context does not contain information about deep learning or specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The text focuses on the application of machine learning, specifically Random Forests (RF), to predict the reproductive condition in fish. The RF model was trained and tested using gonad data from Chilean hake, classified as immature, mature-active, and mature-inactive. The study compares the performance of RF to traditional methods like macroscopy and histology, but it does not mention any deep learning techniques.
