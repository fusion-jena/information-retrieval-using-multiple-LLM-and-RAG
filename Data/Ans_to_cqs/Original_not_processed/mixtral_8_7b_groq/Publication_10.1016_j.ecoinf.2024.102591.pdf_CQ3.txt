The provided context does not directly discuss the data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention the use of a supervised machine learning (ML) classification in the context of fire scar delineation. This process typically involves labeling data, which can be considered a form of annotation.

In the case of fire scar delineation, the initial version of the BA algorithm implemented in FIREMAP involves a supervised ML classification to produce a burned area (BA) vector of the region of interest. A data-mining approach is adopted, using a large predefined training dataset. This dataset is likely to have been annotated with labels indicating whether each pixel belongs to a burned or unburned area.

While the context does not explicitly mention the specific annotation techniques used, it does highlight the importance of accurate annotation for successful ML classification. The authors mention the use of post-fire Level-2A scenes from the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite, which are atmospherically corrected and harmonized. This processing is likely to improve the quality of the annotated data, making it easier for the ML algorithm to distinguish between burned and unburned areas.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, it does mention the use of a supervised ML classification in the context of fire scar delineation. This process involves labeling data, which can be considered a form of annotation. The authors highlight the importance of accurate annotation for successful ML classification, using post-fire Level-2A scenes from the S2 satellite to improve the quality of the annotated data.
