Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various sources of data used in a study related to rabbit habitat suitability, but it does not mention where the data or code for the deep learning pipeline is stored or shared.

The context does mention that the data used in the study came from various sources, including WorldClim, the Copernicus program, the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources, OpenStreetMap, and ESA CCI land cover maps. However, it does not specify where the processed data or code for the deep learning pipeline can be found.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it stands based on the given context. It would be necessary to look for additional information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline in the study's publication or related sources.
