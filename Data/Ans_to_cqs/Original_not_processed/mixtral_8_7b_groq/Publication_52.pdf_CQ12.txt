Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Graph Regularized Extreme Learning Machine Autoencoder (GRELMA). The pipeline is based on the Deep ELM (Extreme Learning Machine) framework, which simulates the functioning of biological brain cells in a realistic mode. This creates the potential for a fully automated configuration of the model with high accuracy classification. The innovative aspect of this work is the development of this model using Online Sequential Multi-layer algorithm plus a GRELMA, aiming to optimize the choice of the input layer weights and bias. This method combines two highly effective machine learning algorithms, for solving a multidimensional and complex machine hearing problem. Additionally, Cellular Simultaneous Recurrent Networks (CSRNs) are applied to generate initial filters of CNNs for features extraction and Regularized Extreme Learning Machines (RELM) for classification. Experiments were conducted on three popular data sets for object recognition (such as face, pedestrian, and car) to evaluate the performance of the new deep neural network.
