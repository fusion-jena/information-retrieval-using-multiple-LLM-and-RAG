Answer:::
I am unable to provide the exact data repository link for the deep learning pipeline as it was not mentioned in the provided context. However, the context does mention the use of various plant species datasets for training deep learning models for plant identification. These datasets might have been obtained from public data repositories such as GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), Figshare, Zenodo, or Dryad. It's common for researchers to share their datasets in these repositories to promote transparency and reproducibility of their research. Therefore, I would recommend looking into these data repositories for the specific plant species datasets used in the research. Additionally, you may consider searching for the authors' names and the related research paper title in these data repositories to locate the relevant datasets.
