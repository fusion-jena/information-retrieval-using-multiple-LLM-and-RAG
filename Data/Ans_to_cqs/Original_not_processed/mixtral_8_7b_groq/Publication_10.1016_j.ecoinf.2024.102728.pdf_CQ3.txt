Answer:::

The provided context does not include specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of deep learning in object retrieval (Mohedano et al., 2017) and feature extraction in remote sensing (Petrovska et al., 2020), which typically involve some form of data annotation.

In object retrieval and computer vision tasks, common data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a rectangle around the object of interest in an image. The coordinates of the rectangle are then used as the label for that object.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image according to the object it belongs to. This provides a more precise label than bounding box annotation, as it can account for objects with irregular shapes or those that are touching.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique is similar to instance segmentation, but it does not differentiate between individual instances of the same object class. Instead, it assigns a label to each pixel based on the object class it belongs to.

In remote sensing and geographic information systems, data annotation techniques may include:

1. Land cover classification: This technique involves labeling areas in an image according to the type of land cover they represent (e.g., forest, grassland, urban). The labels can be based on spectral signatures, texture, or other features extracted from the image.
2. Object-based image analysis: This technique involves segmenting an image into homogeneous regions based on their spectral, textural, or contextual properties. The resulting regions can then be labeled according to the objects they represent.
3. Digital elevation model (DEM) generation: This technique involves creating a 3D representation of the surface elevation in an area. DEMs can be used for various applications, such as flood modeling, terrain analysis, and landscape visualization.

It is important to note that the choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the characteristics of the data. The quality of the annotations can significantly impact the performance of deep learning models, highlighting the importance of careful annotation and validation processes.
