Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various topics related to geospatial analysis, wildfire recovery, and vegetation cover, but it does not mention data augmentation techniques.

Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size of the training dataset and improve model performance by creating modified versions of the existing data. These techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, and other transformations that can help the model generalize better and reduce overfitting.

Therefore, while the provided context is informative and relevant to the topics of geospatial analysis and wildfire recovery, it does not contain the information requested in the query regarding data augmentation techniques in a deep learning pipeline.
