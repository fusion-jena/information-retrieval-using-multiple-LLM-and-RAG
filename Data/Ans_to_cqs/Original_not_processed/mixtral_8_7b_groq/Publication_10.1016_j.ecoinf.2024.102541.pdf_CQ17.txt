Answer:::

The provided context includes information about various deep learning models and techniques, but it does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide a general overview of some common regularization methods, such as dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization technique used during training to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out, or "turning off," a proportion of neurons in a layer (Srivastava et al., 2014). This helps to promote independence among the neurons, reducing the likelihood of co-adaptation and overfitting to the training data. During inference, all neurons are used, but their weights are scaled down by the dropout rate to maintain the expected output.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a method that adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the model's weights (Hoerl & Kennard, 1970). This encourages smaller weight values, reducing the complexity of the model and the likelihood of overfitting.

These regularization techniques can be applied to various deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to improve their generalization performance.
