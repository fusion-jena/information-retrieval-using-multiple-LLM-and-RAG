The provided context discusses machine learning techniques, specifically classification methods, but it does not directly mention regularization methods used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or L2 regularization. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.

However, I can provide some background information on data augmentation, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning, which are mentioned in the context and are related to preventing overfitting in machine learning models.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of the training dataset by generating new samples based on existing ones. This can help improve the generalization capabilities of the model and prevent overfitting. In the context, Staiano (2019) is cited as mentioning the benefits of training data augmentation.

Cross-validation is a resampling technique used to assess the performance of machine learning models. In k-fold cross-validation, the dataset is divided into k folds, and the model is trained on k-1 folds while the remaining fold is used for testing. This process is repeated k times, with a different fold used for testing each time. The average performance across the k runs is then used as an estimate of the model's performance. In the context, 10-fold cross-validation with three repetitions is used to assess the accuracy of the models during the model building phase.

Hyperparameter tuning is the process of selecting the optimal values for the hyperparameters of a machine learning model. Hyperparameters are parameters that are not learned from the data but are set prior to training. Examples of hyperparameters include the learning rate, the number of hidden layers in a neural network, and the regularization strength. Hyperparameter tuning can help improve the performance of the model and prevent overfitting. In the context, hyperparameter tuning is conducted using the caret package in R.

Regularization methods, such as L1 and L2 regularization, are techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Dropout is a regularization technique used in deep learning that randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent overfitting. While these techniques are not mentioned in the provided context, they are important methods for preventing overfitting in deep learning models.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query about regularization methods used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, it does discuss related techniques such as data augmentation, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning. Regularization methods, such as L1 and L2 regularization and dropout, are important techniques for preventing overfitting in deep learning models.
