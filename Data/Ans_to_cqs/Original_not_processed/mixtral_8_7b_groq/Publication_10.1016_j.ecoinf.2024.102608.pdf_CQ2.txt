Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study used satellite data from Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI for water quality parameters estimation. These are remote sensing image data sources, which indicate that image data format was used in this specific deep learning pipeline.

The context also mentions that machine learning approaches were employed, and the performance was assessed using a training and test set approach. This implies that the data was likely organized in a CSV or similar format, with separate columns for input features (x) and target variables (j), and further divided into training and test datasets.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly list the data formats, it can be inferred that image data (from Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI) and CSV-like format (for training and testing datasets) were used in this deep learning pipeline.
