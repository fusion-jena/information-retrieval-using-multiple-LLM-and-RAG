Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the deep learning techniques were applied to a seed image classification and retrieval task. Therefore, it can be inferred that the input data used in this study were image files. Other types of data formats such as audio, video, or CSV are not mentioned in the context.

To provide a more comprehensive answer, typically, deep learning models can handle various data formats depending on the task and application. For instance, image data can be in formats such as JPEG, PNG, or TIFF, while audio data can be in formats such as WAV or MP3. Video data can be in formats such as MP4 or AVI, and structured data can be in formats such as CSV or JSON.

In summary, while the provided context only mentions image data, deep learning models can handle various data formats, including image, audio, video, and structured data.
