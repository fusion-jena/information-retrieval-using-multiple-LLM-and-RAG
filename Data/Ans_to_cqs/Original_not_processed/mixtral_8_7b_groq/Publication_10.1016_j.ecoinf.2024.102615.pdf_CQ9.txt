Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context includes details about a deep learning model for predicting total phosphorus concentration in rivers, but it does not mention where the data used in the pipeline can be found. The reference papers and articles provided also do not contain any information about the data repository. It is possible that the data was collected and used solely for the purpose of this study and is not publicly available. If the data repository becomes available in the future, it would be helpful for reproducibility and further research in this area.
