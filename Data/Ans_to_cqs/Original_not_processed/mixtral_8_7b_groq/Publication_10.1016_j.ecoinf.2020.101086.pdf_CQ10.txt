Answer:::

I am unable to provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the provided context. The context discusses a study related to species distribution models (SDMs) and the effects of sample size on their performance. It mentions a figure (Fig. 4) that shows an example of presence sites (pres\_UNB and pres\_B) for a certain value of k, but it does not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. I recommend looking for additional information or contacting the authors of the study for more details.
