Answer: The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context is Adam. In the Wav2Vec model description section, it is mentioned that "for this technique, Adam is used as an optimizer with an initial learning rate of order 10e-5, which is appropriate for small weight updates throughout the network while fine-tuning."

Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is a popular optimization algorithm used in training deep learning models. It is an extension of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm, which updates the model weights in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. However, unlike SGD, Adam adaptively adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the estimated first and second moments of the gradient. This makes it more efficient and effective in optimizing the model parameters, especially in large and complex models.

Therefore, in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context, the Adam optimization algorithm is used to train the Wav2Vec model and optimize its performance in predicting bird categories based on the raw audio signals of various bird species.
