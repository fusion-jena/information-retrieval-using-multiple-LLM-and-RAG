Answer:::

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The AlexNet network, which is a type of CNN, is utilized as the backbone of the SIAlex model. The SIAlex model is designed to be lightweight and optimized for deep training and short-term testing. To achieve this, the two convolution layers in the model are merged, reducing the number of layers in the model and improving computational efficiency. This helps solve the problems of model training time and computing resources. The structural re-parameterization method is used to reduce the number of model layers, improve computational efficiency, and significantly reduce inference time. Therefore, the type of deep learning model used in this pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
