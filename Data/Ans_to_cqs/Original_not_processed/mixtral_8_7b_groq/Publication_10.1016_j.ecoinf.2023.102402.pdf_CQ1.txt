The provided pieces of context do not discuss deep learning pipelines directly. However, they do mention several methods for collecting raw data in the context of marine research and conservation.

1. Citizen Science Surveys and Questionnaires: Citizen science is the active involvement of the general public in scientific research, including data collection, analysis, and monitoring (Fraisl et al., 2022; Kelly et al., 2020). In marine research, scuba divers contribute significantly to citizen science initiatives by providing data on various marine species, such as seahorses (Kelly et al., 2019, 2020; Lucrezi et al., 2018; Martin et al., 2016). Questionnaires can also be used to gather information on sighting sites, habitat features, and the number of encountered specimens (Kelly et al., 2019, 2020).

2. Social Media and Diving Centers: Social media platforms and diving centers can serve as sources of raw data for marine research. These platforms can provide information on species occurrences, habitat features, and human activities that impact marine ecosystems (Kelly et al., 2019, 2020).

3. Fishing Events: Fishing events can provide valuable data on marine species, their distribution, and the impact of fishing activities on marine ecosystems (Kelly et al., 2019, 2020).

4. Joint Research Efforts and Improved Scientific Data Sharing: Collaborative research efforts and data sharing among scientists can help collect and analyze large amounts of solid information on species occurrences (Kelly et al., 2019, 2020).

5. Bio-ORACLE v2.0: This marine data layer tool provides a wide range of environmental data for bioclimatic modeling, which can be used in deep learning pipelines for marine research (Assis et al., 2018).

In summary, while the provided context does not specifically mention deep learning pipelines, it does discuss various methods for collecting raw data in marine research and conservation, including citizen science surveys, social media, diving centers, fishing events, joint research efforts, and improved scientific data sharing. These methods can potentially be adapted for use in deep learning pipelines for marine research and conservation.

Answer:::
Raw data for deep learning pipelines in marine research can be collected using various methods, including citizen science surveys, social media, diving centers, fishing events, joint research efforts, and improved scientific data sharing. These methods can provide valuable information on marine species, their distribution, habitat features, and human activities that impact marine ecosystems. Additionally, tools like Bio-ORACLE v2.0 can provide environmental data for bioclimatic modeling in deep learning pipelines.
