Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, we can infer that it is used for ecological informatics, specifically for analyzing species distribution data.

The context mentions the use of maximum entropy density estimation and minimum divergence methods in statistical machine learning, which are techniques used in deep learning. These methods are applied to detect outliers in species distribution data and to develop a species distribution model to explain and forecast wolf colonization in south-eastern France.

Additionally, the context mentions a novel method for multi-trajectory reconstruction based on LoMcT for avian migration in population level. Deep learning models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, are commonly used for trajectory reconstruction and prediction.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model in this context is used for either outlier detection, species distribution modeling, or trajectory reconstruction in the field of ecological informatics. However, the specific type of deep learning model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection) is not mentioned in the provided context.
