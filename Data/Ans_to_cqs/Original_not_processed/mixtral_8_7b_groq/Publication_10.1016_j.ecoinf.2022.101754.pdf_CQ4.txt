Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the use of LiDAR and Landsat 8 data for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) in hardwood forests. It describes the preprocessing of ALS data, which includes cylindrical plot design, lidar data thinning, and descriptive statistics calculation. However, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques.

The study utilizes a training-and-test approach with stratification splitting and hyperparameter tuning for four regression models: AdaBoost, random decision forest (RF), multilayer neural network (NET), and Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes). However, the details of the data preprocessing and model training do not indicate the use of data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to confirm the use of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the deep learning pipeline.
