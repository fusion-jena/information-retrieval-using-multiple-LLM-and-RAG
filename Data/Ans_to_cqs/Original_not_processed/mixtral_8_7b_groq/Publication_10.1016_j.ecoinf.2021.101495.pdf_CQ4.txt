Answer: The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline consist of image rotation, changing the contrast and brightness of the image. First, each individual fish is placed so that its longest axis is horizontal, allowing for the generation of new segments with the fish in different left-right hand views and head positions. Specifically, four images are created by generating the three missing rotations, covering all possible positions the model can find a fish. Then, a change in brightness and contrast is randomly applied to each of these four images. The brightness is altered by adding a value β, where β is a natural number between 4 and 4. The contrast is adjusted by multiplying each pixel x of the image by a value α, where α is a real number between 0.9 and 1.1. This can be represented as g(x) = αf(x) + β. These data augmentation techniques result in a total of 86,208 segments for the classification model. The use of data augmentation allows the model to learn more efficiently and with better accuracy.
