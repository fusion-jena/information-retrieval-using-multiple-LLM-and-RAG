Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of two specific datasets: "SSLs’ data set" and "the elephants’ data set."

The SSLs’ data set is likely a dataset of synthetic data generated using a method such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), as referenced in the context (Goodfellow et al., 2014). GANs can generate new data that is similar to a given dataset, which can be useful for training deep learning models when a large enough real-world dataset is not available.

The elephants’ data set, on the other hand, is a public benchmark for aerial object detection, as described in Naude and Joubert (2019). Public datasets like this one are often created through surveys, sensors, or a combination of both. Surveys can include manual counting of objects in images or videos, while sensors can include a variety of devices such as cameras, lidar, or radar.

Additionally, the context references the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in Kamilaris et al. (2019), which suggests that the data may have been collected using aerial sensors mounted on drones or other UAVs.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest the use of both synthetic data generation and public datasets, which may have been collected using surveys, sensors, or a combination of both. Additionally, the use of UAVs for data collection is also mentioned.
