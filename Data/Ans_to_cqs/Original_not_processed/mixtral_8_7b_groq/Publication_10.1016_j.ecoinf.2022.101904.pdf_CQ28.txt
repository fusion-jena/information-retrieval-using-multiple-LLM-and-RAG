The context provided does not give information about the specific platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model. It mainly focuses on the comparison of different deep learning models for wetland classification, such as Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer, CoAtNet, and the proposed 3D UNet Generative Adversarial Network Swin Transformer (3DUNetGSFormer).

The authors do mention that they used various techniques to improve the performance of their models, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Swin Transformer, which incorporates a hierarchical transformer with shifting windows for better global contextual knowledge. However, there is no mention of the cloud platform or infrastructure used to support the training and deployment of these models.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer to the query based on the given context.
