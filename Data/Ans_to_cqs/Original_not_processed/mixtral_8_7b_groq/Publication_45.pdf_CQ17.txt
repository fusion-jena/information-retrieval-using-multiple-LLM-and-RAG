Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning techniques, specifically deep neural networks (DNNs), and mentions the use of regularization methods to prevent overfitting.

Regularization techniques are used to reduce overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data that may not generalize well to new data.

Two regularization methods are explicitly mentioned in the context: dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization technique introduced by Srivastava et al. (2014) that randomly drops out a fraction of the neurons in a layer during training. This prevents the neurons from co-adapting too much to the training data, which can lead to overfitting. Dropout has been shown to be an effective regularization technique for DNNs.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which can reduce overfitting by preventing the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.

The context also mentions the use of hyper-parameter tuning to determine the network architecture and regularization techniques. Hyper-parameter tuning involves iteratively evaluating different hyper-parameter configurations, such as the number of layers and neurons, regularization techniques, and the loss function and optimizer, to determine the best performing model.

In summary, the provided context mentions the use of dropout and L2 regularization as regularization techniques to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Hyper-parameter tuning is also used to determine the best performing model.
