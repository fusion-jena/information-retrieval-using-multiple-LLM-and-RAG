Answer: The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned in the provided context. The text focuses on the training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification, but it does not specify the datasets used for training or testing the model. Commonly used datasets in deep learning image classification include MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 for object recognition, and ImageNet for large-scale image recognition. It is possible that the authors used one or more of these datasets, or a different dataset entirely, to train and test their model.
