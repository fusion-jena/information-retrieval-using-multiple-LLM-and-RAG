Answer:::

The deep learning model for land use and land cover (LULC) classification was trained on an ASUS laptop equipped with an Intel i7-11370H CPU, which has 4 cores and a base clock speed of 3.30 GHz. The system also had 16 GB of DDR4 RAM. For handling the computations and processing related to deep learning, a dedicated NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card with 4 GB of GPU memory was utilized. This GPU is capable of accelerating the training process of deep learning models through its parallel processing capabilities. Training a deep learning model involves numerous matrix and vector operations, which can be efficiently executed on GPUs, leading to reduced training times and better performance compared to using only a CPU. In this study, the specific GPU mentioned was employed to train the deep learning model for LULC classification.

It is important to note that the use of GPUs or other specialized hardware resources, such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), can significantly impact the training time and efficiency of deep learning models. In this case, the study utilized a GPU, but the specific type of hardware can vary depending on the resources available to the researchers or practitioners. The key takeaway is that having a dedicated GPU or other specialized hardware can help in handling the computational demands of training deep learning models for tasks like LULC classification.
