The specific type of deep learning model used in the bioacoustic classification pipelines mentioned in the provided texts is not explicitly stated. However, based on the context and the types of data being analyzed (time-series audio data), it can be inferred that Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or more specifically Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), are likely candidates.

In the Stowell (2022) review, the author discusses the use of deep learning for computational bioacoustics and mentions the success of RNNs and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for analyzing time-series data. CNNs are typically used for image and signal processing tasks, but RNNs are better suited for sequential data, like time-series audio.

In the Soldevilla et al. (2008) study, the authors classify Risso's and Pacific white-sided dolphins using spectral properties of echolocation clicks. This task involves analyzing time-series audio data, which would be more suitable for RNNs.

Furthermore, in the Frainer et al. (2023) and Rom√°n Ruiz et al. (2023) studies, the authors use deep learning for marine mammal classification, but the specific model type is not mentioned. However, given the nature of the data, RNNs would be a likely choice.

In summary, while the specific type of deep learning model used in the bioacoustic classification pipelines is not explicitly stated in the provided texts, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are the most likely candidates for time-series audio data analysis.
