Answer:::

The text provided does not give a specific criterion for determining when training is complete for the AlexNet (AN) algorithm. However, it does mention that the stochastic gradient descent with momentum optimizer was used for training AN, with the initial learning rate set to 0.001 and the maximum number of epochs set to 15. This suggests that the training of AN was stopped after a fixed number of epochs, rather than based on a validation loss plateau or other performance-based criterion.

For the "classical" machine-learning algorithms (AB, GB, HB, and LD), the text states that hyperparameters were left at scikit-learn default values, except for the learning rate of GB and HB and the tolerance threshold value for LD. However, it does not provide information on how training was determined to be complete for these algorithms.

It is worth noting that using a fixed number of epochs for training can be a simple and effective approach, but it may not always result in the best possible performance. Using a validation set and stopping training when performance on the validation set stops improving can often lead to better generalization performance. However, the choice of criterion for determining when training is complete depends on various factors, such as the complexity of the model, the size and quality of the training data, and the computational resources available.
