The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it mentions the use of machine learning algorithms, including artificial neural networks and deep learning, for creating fire risk maps. Typically, when training deep learning models, especially for image processing tasks like creating fire risk maps, GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are commonly used due to their ability to perform parallel processing which significantly speeds up the training process compared to CPUs. However, without specific information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
