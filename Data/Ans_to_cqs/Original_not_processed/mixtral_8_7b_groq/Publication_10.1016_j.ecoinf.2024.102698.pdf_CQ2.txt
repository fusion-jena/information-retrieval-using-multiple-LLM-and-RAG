Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of synthetic connectivity data generated using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. GAN models can be used to generate various data formats, including images, audio, video, and tabular data (such as CSV files).

In the context of this study, the GAN model was used to generate synthetic connectivity matrices, which are likely represented as tabular data in a CSV format or similar. The original connectivity matrices might have been in the same format before being used as input for the GAN model.

The context also mentions the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are primarily used for image and signal processing tasks. This suggests that image or signal data formats might be used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the provided context does not explicitly mention these data formats.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that the pipeline includes tabular data (CSV format) and possibly image or signal data formats based on the use of GAN and CNN models.
