Answer:::

The data formats used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context are spectrograms, which are input images for model training. The audio clips are converted into spectrograms using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a window size of 1600 samples, hop size of 400 samples, and 240 mel-scale frequency bins. Each spectrogram has a height of 438 pixels and a width of 436 pixels.

The recordings are first standardized as they come from community-contributed collections and may be recorded with various recording equipment, settings, and weather conditions. The standardization process involves using a sampling rate of 32 kHz with a 100 Hz high-pass filter as the parameters for audio standardization.

Therefore, the original data format is audio, but it is transformed into spectrograms, which are input images for the deep learning model. Other data formats such as CSV, video, or text are not mentioned in the context.
