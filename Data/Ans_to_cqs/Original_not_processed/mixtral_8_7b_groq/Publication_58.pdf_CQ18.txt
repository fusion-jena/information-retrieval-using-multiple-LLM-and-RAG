Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of a validation set, separate from the learning and test sets. The model's performance is evaluated on this validation set after each epoch of training. This allows for real-time assessment of how well the model is learning and whether it is at risk of overfitting to the training data.

In addition, the learning rate is dynamically adjusted every 20 epochs. It starts at a value of 10^-2 and is divided by 10 until it reaches 10^-6. This strategy, known as learning rate decay, helps to ensure that the model continues to learn effectively even as it becomes more confident in its predictions.

The authors also implemented a balancing method to address the issue of unbalanced data sets, which can negatively impact the performance of neural networks. They used the median frequency balancing method, which involves adjusting the number of samples from each class to be proportional to the median frequency of that class in the training data. This helps to ensure that the model is not biased towards any particular class.

Finally, the authors evaluated the model's performance on a test set that was completely isolated from the training and validation sets. This allowed for an unbiased assessment of the model's generalization ability.

Overall, the strategy implemented to monitor the model's performance during training involves the use of a validation set, learning rate decay, balancing methods, and a final evaluation on a test set. This comprehensive approach helps to ensure that the model is learning effectively and is not overfitting to the training data.
