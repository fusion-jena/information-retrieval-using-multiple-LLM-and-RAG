The provided context does not contain specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the study. However, it does give some insight into the types of data and neural network architectures used.

The study involves the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks related to natural history collections (NHCs). Two CNNs are mentioned: an unstained/stained CNN and a clubmoss/spikemoss CNN. The unstained/stained CNN is used to classify images as either stained or unstained, while the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN is used to classify images as either clubmoss or spikemoss.

The input data for both CNNs are 3-tensors, which are multi-dimensional arrays typically used to represent image data. The input layer for the unstained/stained CNN has a shape of 3x256x256, indicating a color image (3 channels) with a height and width of 256 pixels. The input layer for the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN has a shape of 3x256x256 as well, suggesting the same format.

The CNN architectures follow a common pattern, consisting of convolution layers, batch normalization layers, ReLU activation functions, and pooling layers. These layers are used to extract features from the input images and reduce the spatial dimensions. The architectures then include flatten layers, dropout layers, and linear layers before reaching the output layer, which is a softmax layer for classification.

In summary, the provided context does not contain specific details about data annotation techniques. However, it does reveal that the study uses deep convolutional neural networks for image classification tasks related to natural history collections, with the input data being 3-tensor images and the architectures following a standard pattern of convolution, batch normalization, ReLU, and pooling layers.
