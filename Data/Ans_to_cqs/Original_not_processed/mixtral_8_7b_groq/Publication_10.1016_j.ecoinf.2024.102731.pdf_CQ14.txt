Answer:::

The hyperparameters of the model, specifically the weights of the indicators, are optimized using the L-BFGS-B method (Byrd et al., 1995), a quasi-Newton approach that can handle functions with simple constraints. In this case, the constraints are that the weights must be positive and not greater than 1 (0 ≤ wj ≤ 1).

The L-BFGS-B method is used in conjunction with the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) (Hwang and Yoon, 1981), a distance-based method for evaluating alternatives based on several conflicting criteria. The TOPSIS method scores alternatives not only by their closeness to a positive ideal solution but also by their farness from a negative ideal solution.

To apply the TOPSIS method, the values of the indicators for each alternative (pixel of the study area) are first normalized using vector normalization. These normalized values are then multiplied by the weights of the indicators, representing their relative importance in determining habitat suitability for Oryctolagus cuniculus.

The specific details of how the hyperparameters are tuned, such as through grid search or random search, are not provided in the context. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this part of the query without additional information.

In summary, the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the L-BFGS-B method with constraints, in conjunction with the TOPSIS method for evaluating alternatives based on conflicting criteria. However, the specific method of hyperparameter tuning, such as through grid search or random search, is not provided in the context.
