Answer:::
While the provided context does not directly mention the regularization methods used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, it does discuss the use of XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm that has its own methods to prevent overfitting. However, since the query asks about deep learning, I will provide an answer based on general knowledge.

In deep learning, overfitting is a common issue where a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the loss function, which discourages the learning of overly complex models.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are L2 regularization and dropout.

1. L2 regularization: This method adds a penalty term to the loss function, proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. By doing so, it encourages smaller weights, reducing the complexity of the model and helping to prevent overfitting. L2 regularization is also known as weight decay or ridge regression.

2. Dropout: This is a regularization technique specifically designed for neural networks. During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction of the neurons in a layer to zero, effectively preventing those neurons from contributing to both the forward pass and the backward pass. This helps to break up co-adaptations between neurons, reducing overfitting and improving the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

These regularization techniques are widely used in deep learning to improve model performance and prevent overfitting.
