The text provided does not give specific information about the deep learning frameworks used to build the models. It mentions the use of pre-trained ImageNet weights, which suggests that the models could have been built using a framework compatible with ImageNet, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras. However, there is no explicit statement regarding the frameworks used. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question.
