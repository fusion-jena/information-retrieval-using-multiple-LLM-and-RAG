Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the study does not utilize a deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Instead, it employs an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as a machine learning method for modeling and estimating Above Ground Biomass (AGB). Although ANNs are a type of neural network, they are not considered deep learning models as they typically consist of a single hidden layer, unlike deep learning models that have multiple hidden layers. Therefore, the pipeline in this study incorporates a shallow Artificial Neural Network for processing and predicting AGB.
