Answer:::

The training process of a deep learning model, such as YOLOv5, involves iteratively improving the model's predictions for the training set samples, evaluating them by the loss function, and modifying the model's parameters based on the loss function's gradient. This process continues until the model's annotation accuracy is satisfactory.

In the context provided, the training process of the YOLOv5 model is determined by the loss function depicted in the left panel of Figure 2. This function penalizes incorrect predictions and missed ones of the three focal species. The learning process consists of reducing this penalty for the training set images (blue) using a stochastic gradient algorithm.

The validation set images (red) do not participate in the optimization, but their loss is monitored to check for overfitting. If the validation loss stabilizes, it suggests that further training might lead to overfitting. Therefore, the deep learning model generated by 30 training epochs was used for tests.

Additionally, the model's average precision (AP) improves with the number of training epochs, as shown in the right panel of Figure 2. The model's mean AP over the three insect classes is depicted in the plot.

Recall that precision is the fraction of correctly classified objects among all classified objects, and it is defined as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives. In this study, precision is used as a criterion to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the YOLOv5 model in this study are the validation loss plateau and the model's precision. Once the validation loss stabilizes and the model's precision is satisfactory, the training process is considered complete.
