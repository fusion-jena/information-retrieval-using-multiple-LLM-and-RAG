Based on the provided context, there are no specific details mentioned about the criteria used to split the data for training the deep learning models. However, it is a common practice in machine learning and deep learning to split the dataset into three subsets: training set, validation set, and test set.

The training set is used to train the model, i.e., to learn the relationship between the input features and the target labels. The validation set is used during the training process to evaluate the model's performance and adjust the model's parameters. This helps to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model learns the training data too well, to the point where it performs poorly on unseen data. The test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model on unseen data.

In the context of water quality level classification using a CNN model, the dataset could be split into training, validation, and test sets based on the following criteria:

1. **Random sampling**: The dataset can be randomly split into three subsets, ensuring that each subset has a representative sample of the different water quality levels.
2. **Temporal or spatial splitting**: If the dataset contains time-series or spatial data, it might be more appropriate to split the data based on time or space. For instance, if the dataset contains water quality measurements taken over several years, one could use the data from the first two years for training, the data from the third year for validation, and the data from the fourth year for testing. Similarly, if the dataset contains measurements taken at different locations, one could use measurements from some locations for training, measurements from other locations for validation, and measurements from the remaining locations for testing.
3. **Stratified sampling**: If the dataset is imbalanced, i.e., some water quality levels are overrepresented while others are underrepresented, it might be beneficial to use stratified sampling. This involves splitting the dataset in such a way that each subset has approximately the same percentage of samples from each water quality level.

In the paper "Prediction of water level and water quality using a CNN-LSTM combined deep learning approach" by Baek et al. (2020), there is no explicit mention of how the data was split for training the CNN-LSTM model. However, it can be inferred that they used a combination of temporal and random sampling, as they mentioned using "the first 80% of the data for training and the remaining 20% for testing."

In conclusion, while there is no specific information provided in the context about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it is common practice to use a combination of random, temporal, or spatial, and stratified sampling, depending on the dataset's characteristics and the problem at hand.
