Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the described deep learning pipeline. The focus of the text is on the exploration of different parameter values and regularization techniques during the training of an autoencoder and an MLP, as well as the use of focal loss with adjustable parameters.

The autoencoder's training involves adjusting learning rates, batch sizes, weight decay values, and dropout rates. Similarly, the MLP's training includes testing various learning rates, batch sizes, weight decay values, and dropout rates, along with the investigation of focal loss parameters α and γ. However, there is no information indicating the application of data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling.

It's important to note that data augmentation techniques can be beneficial in deep learning pipelines, especially when handling imbalanced datasets. These techniques can help increase the size and diversity of the training set, improving the model's ability to generalize. Nonetheless, the context provided does not contain information about the use of these particular data augmentation methods.
