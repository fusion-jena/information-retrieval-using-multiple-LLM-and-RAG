Answer:::

The deep learning models mentioned in the context are used for object detection in the field of agriculture, specifically for detecting weeds.

In the paper "DeepWeeds: a multiclass weed species image dataset for deep learning" by Olsen et al. (2019), the authors introduce a dataset for training deep learning models for the purpose of weed species identification. The models are trained to classify images of different weed species, which can assist in automated weed management.

In the paper "Unsupervised domain adaptation of object detectors: A survey" by Oza et al. (2023), the authors survey various techniques for adapting object detectors to new domains. These techniques can be applied to weed detection models to improve their performance when deployed in new environments.

The paper "Deep neural networks for weed detections towards precision weeding" by Rahman et al. (2022) discusses the use of deep neural networks for weed detection. The authors highlight the potential of these models for precision weeding, which involves applying herbicides only to the areas where weeds are detected.

The paper "TobSet: A new tobacco crop and weeds image dataset and its utilization for vision-based spraying by agricultural robots" by Alam et al. (2022) introduces a new dataset for training deep learning models for weed detection in tobacco crops. The models are used for object detection, specifically for detecting weeds in images of tobacco crops.

The paper "Precision chemical weed management strategies: A review and a design of a new CNN-based modular spot sprayer" by Allmendinger et al. (2022) discusses the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for weed detection in the context of precision chemical weed management. The authors propose a new CNN-based modular spot sprayer for precise herbicide application.

The paper "Presenting an extensive lab-and field-image dataset of crops and weeds for computer vision tasks in agriculture" by Beck et al. (2021) introduces a new dataset for training deep learning models for crop and weed detection. The models can be used for both image classification and object detection tasks.

In the context, the specific deep learning models used for weed detection are YOLOX and YOLOv8. These models are object detection models that can identify and locate objects within an image. The hyperparameters of these models are optimized for the task of weed detection, as shown in Table 2 of the context. The classification loss is calculated using binary cross-entropy (BCE), and the location loss is calculated using Intersection over Union (IoU). Data augmentation techniques such as color jitter, mosaic, VFL (Zhang et al., 2021), DFL (Li et al., 2020), and CIoU (Zheng et al., 2021) are used to improve the model's performance.

Therefore, the deep learning models mentioned in the context are used for object detection, specifically for detecting weeds in agricultural settings. The models can assist in automated weed management and precision weeding, which can reduce herbicide use and improve crop yield.
