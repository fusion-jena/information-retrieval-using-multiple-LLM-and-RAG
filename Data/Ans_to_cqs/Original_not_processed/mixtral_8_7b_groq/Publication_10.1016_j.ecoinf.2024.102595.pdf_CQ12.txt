Answer:::
The specific deep learning model used in the described pipeline is a Deep Neural Network (DNN). This information is provided in the article's context, where it mentions that "The deep learning model used was the deep neural network (Deep Neural Network)". Deep Neural Networks are a type of artificial neural network that are composed of multiple layers, including an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer. They are capable of learning complex patterns and representations from data, making them suitable for tasks such as yield prediction in agriculture. However, the context does not specify the exact architecture or configuration of the DNN used in this study.
