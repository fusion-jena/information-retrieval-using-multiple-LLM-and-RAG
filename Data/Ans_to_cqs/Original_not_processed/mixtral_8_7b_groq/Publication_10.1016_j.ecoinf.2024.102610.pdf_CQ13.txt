The provided context does not contain information about the specific deep learning model used or its hyperparameters. It mainly discusses the use of machine learning methodologies, specifically random forests, for predicting tsetse fly relative numbers.

Two common variable elimination techniques for random forests are mentioned: Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Variable Selection Using Random Forests (VSURF). However, these techniques are not directly related to deep learning model hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer.

In RFE, the user defines a termination condition for model performance, and the algorithm iteratively removes one variable at a time while evaluating its impact on the model's performance. VSURF follows a three-step process to select variables.

To answer the query, we would need more context about the deep learning model employed, including the type of model, architecture, and specific hyperparameters used.

Answer:::
The provided context does not contain information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
