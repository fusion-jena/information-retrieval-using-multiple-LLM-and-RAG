Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context focuses more on the application of UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for species distribution modeling and the selection of bioclimatic variables for the target species.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to use specialized hardware such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) or TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) to accelerate the training process due to their ability to perform parallel computations. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that some form of specialized hardware was used during the development of the model described in the context.

Another point to consider is the reference to a convolutional neural network (CNN) in the context. CNNs are a type of deep learning model commonly used for image analysis tasks, and they can be computationally intensive. Training a CNN on large datasets typically requires a significant amount of computational power, which is one of the reasons why GPUs or TPUs are often employed.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, it is likely that specialized hardware such as GPUs or TPUs were used due to the nature of deep learning models and the reference to a computationally intensive CNN.
