Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the comparison of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models for predicting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH) for the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency dataset.

However, the deep learning models mentioned in the context, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), typically do not require traditional data annotation techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. These models are primarily used for sequential data, time series forecasting, and natural language processing tasks, where annotation techniques are not applicable.

In the context, the deep learning model used is a GRU-DNN architecture, which combines GRU with a regular deep neural network (DNN). The GRU layer is used to capture the temporal dependencies in the marine dataset, followed by fully connected layers for producing the predicted values.

In summary, the provided context does not mention any data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The deep learning models mentioned are typically used for sequential data and do not require traditional data annotation techniques.
