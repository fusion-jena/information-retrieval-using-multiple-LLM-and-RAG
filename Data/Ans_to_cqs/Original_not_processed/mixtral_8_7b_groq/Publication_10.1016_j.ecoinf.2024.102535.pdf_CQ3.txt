Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning in the analysis of seabed images but does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of image annotation was used in the process of preparing the dataset for deep learning.

Common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

1. **Image labeling**: This is the process of assigning a class label to an entire image. For example, an image of a seabed might be labeled as "sand" or "rock."
2. **Bounding box annotation**: This involves drawing a bounding box around an object of interest in an image and assigning a class label to that object. For example, a fish in a marine image might be enclosed in a bounding box and labeled as "fish."
3. **Semantic segmentation**: This is the process of dividing an image into multiple regions, each of which is assigned a class label. Unlike bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation provides a pixel-level classification of the image.
4. **Instance segmentation**: This is an extension of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and assigned a unique identifier.

The context mentions the use of data augmentation techniques such as rotation and flipping, which are often applied to annotated images to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset.

In the context of marine image annotation, the paper "marine image annotation: lessons learned and future directions" (Schoening et al., 2017a) may provide more information on the data annotation techniques used in this field.

Additionally, the paper "Classification trees with unbiased multiway splits" (Kim and Loh, 2001) discusses methods for unbiased multiway splits in classification trees, which could be relevant for the annotation of marine images with multiple classes.

Overall, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that some form of image annotation was used, and the mentioned data augmentation techniques are commonly applied to annotated images.
