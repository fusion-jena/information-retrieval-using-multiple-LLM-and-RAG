The provided context does not contain specific information about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some preprocessing techniques used in the studies, such as unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning steps in the VAE (Variational Autoencoder) model.

In general, techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain characteristics (such as class labels) and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to ensure that each subset of the data is representative of the overall population.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class in the dataset to balance it with the majority class.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class in the dataset to balance it with the minority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population in terms of demographics, geographic location, and other relevant factors.

It's important to note that addressing data bias is an essential step in the machine learning pipeline, as biased data can lead to models that perform poorly or make inaccurate predictions. Therefore, it's recommended to use one or more of the above techniques to ensure that the data is balanced and representative of the population.
