Answer:::

The text provided describes the use of a deep learning model called MLPnn-MC, which integrates a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm and Markov chain for land use and land cover (LULC) simulation. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific deep learning framework or library used, which would typically provide information on hyperparameters such as learning rate and optimizer.

However, we can infer some of the hyperparameters used in this model from the values provided in Table 7. The 'Start learning rate' is given as 0.0008, which is the initial value of the learning rate. The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls how much the weights in the model are adjusted with respect to the loss gradient during training. A smaller learning rate means the model will learn more slowly, while a larger learning rate means the model will learn more quickly.

The 'End learning rate' is given as 0.0001, which is the final value of the learning rate. It is common to decrease the learning rate during training to help the model converge to a minimum of the loss function.

The 'Momentum factor' is given as 0.5. This is another hyperparameter used in optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The momentum factor helps the optimization process overcome local minima by accumulating the gradient history.

The 'Sigmoid constant' is given as 1.0. In neural networks, the sigmoid function is often used as an activation function. The sigmoid constant, also known as the temperature, controls the slope of the sigmoid function.

The 'Iterations' is given as 10,000. This is the number of times the training algorithm will iterate over the data to adjust the model's weights.

An optimizer is not explicitly mentioned, but a common optimizer used with MLPs is gradient descent with backpropagation, which is an optimization algorithm used to minimize some function by iteratively moving in the direction of steepest descent as defined by the negative of the gradient.
