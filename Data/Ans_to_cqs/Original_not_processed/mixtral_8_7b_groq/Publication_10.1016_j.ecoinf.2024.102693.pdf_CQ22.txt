Answer:::
The performance of deep learning models in the provided context is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Accuracy is the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions. It is a common metric used to evaluate the overall performance of a model. In the context, the accuracy of various methods, including those proposed by Wu et al. (2019), Yang et al. (2021), Liu et al. (2022), Peng and Wang (2022), An et al. (2023), Zheng et al. (2023), Wang et al. (2023), Lin et al. (2023), Ayan et al. (2020), Ung et al. (2021), Su et al. (2023), and the proposed "Ours" method, is reported in Table 3.

Precision, on the other hand, is the ratio of true positive predictions (correctly labeled positive samples) to the total number of positive predictions. It measures the model's ability to identify positive samples accurately. The precision of various methods is reported in Table 3.

Recall, also known as sensitivity, is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive samples. It measures the model's ability to identify all positive samples. The recall of various methods is reported in Table 3.

The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced evaluation of a model's performance. It is a more robust metric than accuracy, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets. The F1-score of various methods is reported in Table 3.

In addition to these metrics, the provided context also includes ablation experiments (Section 5.1) that evaluate the impact of specific models, such as Resnet-50, ViT-S/16, Volo-d1, ViP-Small/7, and ensemble methods (VecEnsemble and MatEnsemble) on the model's performance. These experiments help to understand the contribution of each model to the overall performance.

In summary, the performance of deep learning models in the provided context is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance in identifying positive and negative samples.
