Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. The context includes several research papers related to various topics such as moisture, freeze-thaw depths, tuberculosis epidemiology, and permafrost degradation. However, none of these papers describe the deployment of a deep learning model.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information. Deploying a deep learning model typically involves several steps, including model serialization, platform selection, and model integration with other systems or applications. However, the specific process can vary depending on the requirements of the project and the characteristics of the model.

In summary, while I can provide general information about deploying deep learning models, I cannot answer this query without more context.
