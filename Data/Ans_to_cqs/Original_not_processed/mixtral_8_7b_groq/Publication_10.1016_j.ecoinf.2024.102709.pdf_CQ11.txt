Answer:::

The data repository link for the deep learning pipeline is available on Zenodo under the DOI: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10663114>. This repository includes the dataset used in the study, which consists of single-tree point clouds, images of single-trees, and *.csv files containing the attributes used to produce the images, reference data, clusters of numbers in two different point-thickness settings, labeled numbers, preprocessed images of the numbers, numbers from the best split, and tables containing the results of the digit recognition. The dataset was used to train the YOLOv8n model, which performed the best in predicting and recognizing the clusters when trained solely on the provided data.
