The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is common practice to use data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset in deep learning. These techniques can help improve the model's ability to generalize and reduce overfitting.

Flipping refers to horizontally or vertically flipping the images in the dataset. This technique can help the model learn symmetrical features in the images.

Rotating involves rotating the images by a certain angle. This can help the model learn features that are invariant to rotation.

Scaling involves changing the size of the images. This technique can help the model learn features that are invariant to scaling.

Therefore, it is possible that these data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline described in the context, but it is not explicitly stated.
