The text provided does not give information on the specifics of model serialization or platform selection for deploying the trained deep learning model. However, it does offer insights into the process followed for training the model, which can be summarized as follows:

1. **Selection of Network Architecture**: The number of layers, the number of neurons in the hidden layer, and the learning rates were determined using a trial-and-error method. The number of nodes in the hidden layer was varied between 5 and 23, and the learning rate was varied from 0.01 to 1.0 in increments of 0.05. The mean square error (MSE) between the model output and the measured data was calculated for each configuration.

2. **Initialization and Training**: The model weights were randomly initialized, and the training process was carried out using the backpropagation algorithm to compute the gradient and update the network parameters, such as weights and biases.

3. **Early Stopping**: To avoid overfitting, the training process was stopped when the network began to overfit the data. This was determined by monitoring the error on a validation set, which consisted of 20% of the data set that was separate from the training set.

4. **Final Model Structure**: The final ANN structure had five input variables with one node accounting for bias, 19 hidden neurons with one node accounting for bias, a 0.7 learning rate, and one output variable of the output layer.

While the text does not explicitly mention model serialization or platform selection, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized for deployment, a common practice in deep learning projects. Model serialization involves saving the model architecture, weights, and other relevant information into a file, which can then be loaded and used for making predictions on new data.

As for platform selection, the text does not provide enough information to make a determination. The choice of platform would depend on various factors, including the specific requirements of the project, the resources available, and the expertise of the team. Common platforms for deploying deep learning models include local servers, cloud services, and edge devices.
