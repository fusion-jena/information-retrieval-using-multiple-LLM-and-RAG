Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the data formats used in a particular deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of footprint images in a study that involves deep learning models for classifying three sympatric otter species. The study suggests that a model trained on images of all qualities, including lower-quality ones, was only marginally outperformed by a model trained on high-quality prints. This implies the use of image data format in this specific deep learning pipeline.

In addition, the context also refers to a dataset of cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) footprints processed by an operator. Although the quality of these images is not as high as the standard protocol usually requires, their inclusion in the study allows exploration of the robustness of the methodology in handling data of varying quality. This further supports the assumption that image data format is used in this deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that image data format is used in the deep learning pipeline for classifying animal species based on their footprints.
