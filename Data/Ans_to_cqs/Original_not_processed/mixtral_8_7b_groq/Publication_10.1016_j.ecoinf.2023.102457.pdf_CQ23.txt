Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Generalizability, also known as model's ability to perform well on unseen data, can be assessed using techniques such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, and stratified splitting. However, the context does not mention the use of any of these techniques.

The context does mention that they used five different feature types, including embeddings from BirdNET, VGGish, Wav2Vec2, acoustic indices, and MFCCs, and evaluated their performance using classification accuracy and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) for affinity propagation clustering and HDBSCAN. They also tested the successful clustering using MFCCs as a feature extraction technique and HDBSCAN for unsupervised classification at distances less than or equal to 150 meters.

Additionally, the context states that they used pre-trained CNNs, which may have limited the potential performance of using embeddings from neural networks. This suggests that they may have faced challenges in obtaining a diverse dataset for training their deep learning model.

In conclusion, while the context provides information on the methods used for feature extraction, evaluation, and clustering, it does not explicitly state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
