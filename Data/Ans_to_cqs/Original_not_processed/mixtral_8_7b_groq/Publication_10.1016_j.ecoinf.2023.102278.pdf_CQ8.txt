Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of the Adam optimizer in a ResNet50 architecture for object detection, as well as the application of transfer learning and dropout regularization. However, it does not mention where the code for this project is hosted. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query. It is always a good practice to include information about the code repository in research papers or reports, as it allows others to reproduce and build upon the work. I would recommend checking the cited sources or contacting the authors for more information.
