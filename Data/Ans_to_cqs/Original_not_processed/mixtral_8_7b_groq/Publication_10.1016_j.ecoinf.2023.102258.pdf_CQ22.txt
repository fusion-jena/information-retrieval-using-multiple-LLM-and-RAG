Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, it does mention that an "event-based F-score" is used as the evaluation measure. The F-score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it is commonly used in information retrieval and natural language processing tasks. It is calculated as 2 \* (precision \* recall) / (precision + recall). Therefore, it can be inferred that precision and recall are used as metrics to calculate the F-score.

Additionally, the context also mentions that the model's performance is evaluated on different sets, including evaluation sets and a query set. The evaluation sets are used to calculate the aforementioned F-score, while the query set is used to calculate the Euclidean distance between each sample and the prototypes, and then use a softmax function to produce a distribution over the classes.

It is also worth noting that the model's performance is evaluated in the context of few-shot learning, which is a specific task in machine learning where the model is trained on a small number of examples and then tested on new, unseen examples. Therefore, the chosen evaluation measure should align well with the task's requirements and external validity, such as expert evaluations of automatic transcripts.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, it can be inferred that precision and recall are used to calculate the F-score, which is the chosen evaluation measure. Additionally, the model's performance is evaluated on different sets and in the context of few-shot learning.
