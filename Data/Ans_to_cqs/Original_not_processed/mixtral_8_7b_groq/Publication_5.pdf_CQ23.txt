Answer:::

The provided context discusses the development and evaluation of a deep learning model for species richness estimation, but it does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was trained and tested using data from Korea and that iterative grid search parameter tuning was performed using a small subset of the data.

Additionally, the authors mention that they used a statistical feature importance test (SFIT) to explain which feature had the greatest significance in the species richness retrievals and to determine the optimized features in an operational retrieval system. This suggests that they were aware of the importance of feature selection and optimization in developing a robust model.

It is also worth noting that the model was compared to a random forest model in terms of statistical accuracy metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Bias, and Correlation. The deep learning model outperformed the random forest model in all of these metrics, which suggests that the deep learning model may have better generalizability.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it does suggest that the authors were aware of the importance of feature selection and optimization, and the comparison with a random forest model suggests that the deep learning model may have good generalizability. However, without more information it is not possible to say for certain what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
