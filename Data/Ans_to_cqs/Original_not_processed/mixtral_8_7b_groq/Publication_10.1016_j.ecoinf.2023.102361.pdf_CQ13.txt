Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models. Hyperparameters are configurable parameters that govern the training process of machine learning models, such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizer, and more. While the context provides a detailed description of the datasets and the deep learning models used, it does not mention any specific values or choices of hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given information.
