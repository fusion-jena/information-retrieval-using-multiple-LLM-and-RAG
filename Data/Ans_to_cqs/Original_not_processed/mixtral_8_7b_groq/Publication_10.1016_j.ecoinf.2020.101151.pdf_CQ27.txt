Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, we can make some educated guesses based on common practices in the field of machine learning.

The process of deploying a deep learning model typically involves several steps, including model serialization, platform selection, and integration with existing systems.

Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model to disk so that it can be loaded and used later. This is typically done using a format such as HDF5 or Tensorflow's SavedModel format. Model serialization allows for easy versioning of the model and facilitates deployment to different platforms.

Platform selection involves choosing the hardware and software environment where the model will be deployed. This could range from a local machine to a cloud-based platform such as AWS or Google Cloud. The choice of platform depends on several factors, including the expected volume of requests, the required latency, and the available resources.

Integration with existing systems involves connecting the deployed model to the application or system that will use it. This could involve building a REST API around the model, or integrating it directly into an existing application.

In the context of the provided information, it is mentioned that there is an analysis tool (Fig. 3) that is used for analyzing forest fires. It is possible that the deep learning model is integrated into this tool, although the specifics of this integration are not provided.

Therefore, while we do not have explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it is likely that the common steps of model serialization, platform selection, and integration with existing systems were followed.
