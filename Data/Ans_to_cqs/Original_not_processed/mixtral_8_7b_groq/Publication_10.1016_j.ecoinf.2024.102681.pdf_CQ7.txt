Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validation of the deep learning models. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to split the dataset into these three subsets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to train the model, updating the model's parameters based on the gradient of the loss function. The validation set is employed to fine-tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting during the training process. Lastly, the testing set is utilized to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data, providing an unbiased estimation of the model's generalization capability.

In the context of drought assessment and prediction, Kaur et al. (2020) and Khorram & Jehbez (2023) developed deep learning models without explicitly mentioning the data splitting criteria. Nonetheless, it is plausible to assume that they followed standard practices in deep learning, using a portion of their dataset for training, another portion for validation, and the remaining data for testing.

In summary, although the provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it is common practice to use a training set, a validation set, and a testing set. These subsets are used for training the model, tuning hyperparameters, and evaluating the model's performance, respectively.
