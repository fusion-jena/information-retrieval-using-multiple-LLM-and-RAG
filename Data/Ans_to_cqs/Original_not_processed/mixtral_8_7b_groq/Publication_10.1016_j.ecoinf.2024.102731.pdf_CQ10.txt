Answer:::

I am unable to provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline because there is no information provided in the context that indicates the creation or use of a deep learning pipeline, nor any mention of a code repository link. The context consists of various documents and articles related to topics such as green infrastructure, land cover, digital elevation models, rabbit habitats, mountain ungulates, agricultural land abandonment, and habitat loss. However, there is no connection to a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. I can only provide information that is supported by the given context.
