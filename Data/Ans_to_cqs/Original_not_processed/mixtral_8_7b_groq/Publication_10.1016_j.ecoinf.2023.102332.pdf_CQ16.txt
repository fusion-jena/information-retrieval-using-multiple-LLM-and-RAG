Based on the provided context, there is no information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the data collection, processing, and analysis of hiking trail data from the Wikiloc platform. It includes details about the number of trails, users, and textual descriptions, as well as the pre-filtering measures applied to the data. However, it does not provide information on the training and validation of machine learning models or the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
