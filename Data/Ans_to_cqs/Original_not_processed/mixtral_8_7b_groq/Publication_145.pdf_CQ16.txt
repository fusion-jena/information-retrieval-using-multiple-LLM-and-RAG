Answer:::
The pieces of context do not explicitly state the specific criterion used to determine when training is complete. However, they do provide some information that suggests a possible criterion. The model was trained for 300 epochs with 24 images per batch, but it is not clear if this number was predetermined or if it was based on some evaluation of the training process. The context does mention that the network was trained on a training dataset containing 80% of the available images (819 images) and validated on an independent validation dataset containing the remaining 20% of the images (205 images). 

Therefore, one possible criterion for determining when training is complete could be based on the performance of the model on the validation dataset. Specifically, training could be considered complete when the validation loss plateaus or when there is no significant improvement in the validation loss over a certain number of epochs. This approach is a common way to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well to new data. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the model segmented 1195 objects on the validation dataset, but it does not provide any information about how this number was used to determine when training was complete. It is possible that this number was used to evaluate the performance of the model, but it is not clear if it was used as a criterion for determining when training was complete. 

In summary, while the pieces of context do not explicitly state the criterion used to determine when training is complete, they suggest that it may have been based on the validation loss or the number of objects segmented on the validation dataset. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
