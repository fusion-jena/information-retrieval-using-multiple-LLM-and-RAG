Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The sources cited in the context provide the theoretical and experimental aspects of the study but do not mention the code repository. Additionally, the R package "deepnet" mentioned in the context is a general-purpose deep learning toolkit and not specifically the pipeline used in the study. Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the code repository. It is recommended to contact the authors of the study for more information.
