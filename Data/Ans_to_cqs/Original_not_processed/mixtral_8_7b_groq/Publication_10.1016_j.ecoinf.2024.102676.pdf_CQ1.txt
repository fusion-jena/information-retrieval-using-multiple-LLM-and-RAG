Answer:

The methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline can include surveys, sensors, and public datasets. 

In the context of wildlife conservation, one approach for collecting raw data involves the use of professional tracking and community involvement through citizen science data collection of footprints. This method is discussed in a 2024 preprint by Schwerter et al., where the authors propose an integrated approach that combines professional tracking with community-generated data to monitor endangered and elusive species. This approach has the potential to widen the range of Footprint Identification Techniques (FIT) and encourages the development of new species algorithms for which the number of high-quality prints in a trail found in situ is usually lower. 

The authors strongly believe that the utilization of professional tracking combined with community involvement holds immense potential as a non-invasive method in the toolbox of every conservationist for monitoring endangered and elusive species. This integrated approach allows for the collection of valuable data from both experts and the general public, fostering a collaborative effort in wildlife conservation. 

In addition to surveys, sensors can also be used to collect raw data for deep learning pipelines. For example, in a 2014 study by Gu et al., the authors determined the sex of Amur tigers from footprints in snow using sensors. They developed a new method for sex determination of Amur tigers based on footprint measurements obtained from sensors in the snow. 

Public datasets are another source of raw data for deep learning pipelines. In the context of footprint recognition, the North-American Animal Tracks Database (<https://www.north-american-animal-tracks-database.org/>) can be used as a public dataset. This database provides a collection of animal tracks from North America, which can be used for footprint recognition and other related tasks. 

Moreover, in a 2004 technical report by Hasler et al., the authors discussed a footprint recognition system for rodents and insects. They used a technical report as a source of raw data, which included footprint images and measurements of rodents and insects. 

In summary, surveys, sensors, and public datasets are some of the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. In the context of wildlife conservation, professional tracking combined with community involvement and public datasets can be used to collect raw data for footprint recognition and other related tasks.
