The provided context discusses the use of the CART decision tree model and the Random Forest Regression (RFR) method for predicting wetland area and depth, but it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide information about data preprocessing and the 'sklearn' library, which can be used for addressing data bias.

In the context, the GF-6 remote sensing data undergo preprocessing, including radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, geometric correction, and image cropping. These steps help improve data quality and ensure accurate analysis.

In the implementation of the CART model, specific model parameters such as 'max_depth', 'min_samples_leaf', and 'max_leaf_nodes' are fine-tuned to prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation error. This process can be seen as a way to handle data bias by carefully adjusting the model's complexity to better suit the data.

The 'sklearn' library, which is used for implementing both the CART model and the RFR method, provides various techniques to handle data bias during preprocessing in a deep learning pipeline. These techniques include:

1. Stratified sampling: This method ensures that the train and test datasets have approximately the same percentage of samples of each target class as the complete dataset. Stratified sampling can be used during the splitting of data to maintain balance and avoid bias.

2. Resampling techniques: These methods include oversampling and undersampling. Oversampling replicates samples from the minority class to balance the dataset, while undersampling reduces the number of samples from the majority class. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is an advanced oversampling method that creates synthetic samples instead of replicating existing ones.

3. Diverse data collection: This technique focuses on collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the target population. This helps reduce bias and improves model performance.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it does discuss data preprocessing and the use of the 'sklearn' library, which provides several techniques to handle data bias. These techniques include stratified sampling, resampling methods (oversampling, undersampling, and SMOTE), and diverse data collection.
