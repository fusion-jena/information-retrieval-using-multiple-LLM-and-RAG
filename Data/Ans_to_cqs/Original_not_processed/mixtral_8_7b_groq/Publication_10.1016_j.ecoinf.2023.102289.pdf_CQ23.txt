Answer:::

The text provided does not give explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of a specific dataset, ADE20K, which has been developed by the MIT Torralba team and focuses on the recognition of 150 indoor and outdoor objects. The authors of the study used 55 outdoor visual landscape elements from this dataset. The use of a diverse and large-scale dataset like ADE20K can contribute to the generalizability of the model as it exposes the model to a variety of objects and scenarios.

Additionally, the authors mention using GluonCV, which offers a set of 25 segmentation models, ten of which have been trained on the ADE20K dataset. The use of pre-trained models can also help improve the generalizability of the model as these models have already been trained on a large dataset and have learned features that can be useful for the task at hand.

However, the text does not mention the use of techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are commonly used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets and training and evaluating the model on each subset. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset in a way that ensures each subset has a similar distribution of classes. These techniques can help ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and is able to generalize well to new, unseen data.

Therefore, while the text provides some information about the dataset and pre-trained models used, it does not explicitly mention the use of techniques to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
