Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that some form of image labeling was performed, since the CNN model was trained to classify Chironomidae head capsule images into specific taxonomic categories.

The context does mention the use of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to visualize the regions of the images most informative for the decision-making process in the deep learning model. This suggests that the model was trained using image-level annotations, where each input image is assigned a single label corresponding to its taxonomic class. Instance-level annotations, such as bounding box annotations or segmentation masks, would provide more detailed information about the location and extent of objects within images. However, the context does not mention the use of these more fine-grained annotation techniques.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state the data annotation techniques used, it can be inferred that image-level annotations were employed in the deep learning pipeline.
