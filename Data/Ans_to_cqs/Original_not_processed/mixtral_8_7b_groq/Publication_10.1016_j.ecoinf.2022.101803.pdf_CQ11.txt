Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link, such as a link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context focuses on a study that compares various methods for modeling sparrow population data, including the proposed RBF-GFR-RF model, regularization, and the original GFR model from Matthiopoulos et al. (2011). The study uses four real-life datasets, one of which is the sparrow population dataset, and several simulated datasets. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link.

The context does provide information about the datasets' sizes, such as 200,000 data points for the simulated dataset in Matthiopoulos et al. (2015) and 20 sparrows in the sparrow population dataset. It also mentions the variables used in the datasets, such as food, temperature, population size, and distance to high human use.

Therefore, I cannot provide the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline because it is not mentioned in the provided context.
