Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through grid search, random search, or any other optimization method.

However, the context does mention the use of the `ppmlasso` package, which implements the Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) method for regularization. The Lasso method involves penalizing the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients, which can improve predictive performance and perform variable selection, resulting in simpler and more interpretable models.

The `ppmlasso` package includes several hyperparameters that can be adjusted, such as the spatial resolution `sp.scale`, the column number of the observer bias proxy `cov.bias`, the value to factor out of the observer bias proxy `kVal`, and the number of models to fit through the regularization path `n.fits`. However, the context does not provide information on how these hyperparameters are optimized.

Furthermore, the context describes the use of the `ppmlassoLoopEngine` function, which applies the Loop methods with extensions. While the Loop methods involve iteratively fitting models and updating parameters, the context does not specify how the hyperparameters of the models are optimized within this iterative process.

Therefore, while the `ppmlasso` package and `ppmlassoLoopEngine` function provide several hyperparameters that can be adjusted, the context does not provide information on how these hyperparameters are optimized.
