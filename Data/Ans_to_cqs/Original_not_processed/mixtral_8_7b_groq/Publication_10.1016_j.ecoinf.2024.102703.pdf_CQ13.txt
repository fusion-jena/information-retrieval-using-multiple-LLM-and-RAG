Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does provide information about other hyperparameters. 

The deep learning model in question is a three-layer backpropagation artificial neural network (BP ANN) created using MATLAB R2014b. The maximum training times were set to 10,000, and the training error was set to 0.001. 

The input layer of the neural network corresponds to the aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) values, while the intermediate (hidden) layer and the output layer each consist of a single neuron that corresponds to the predictor TSI. 

The model was calibrated using 64 water samples, with the remaining samples used for validation. The validation accuracy was assessed by calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI values. 

The RMSE was determined using the formula: RMSE = sqrt(sum(n, (Mea.TSI - Pre.TSI)^2) / n), where Mea.TSI is the measured TSI and Pre.TSI is the TSI predicted using the neural network model.

Additionally, a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) model was used to investigate the multicollinearity between environmental factors and identify the most relevant variables for predicting Fn355. This model used pH, water temperature, nutrients (TP, TN, NH4-N, and NO3-N), and phytoplankton (Chl-a) as predictors, with Fn355 as the response variable.

Therefore, while the learning rate and optimizer are not specified, the context provides information about other hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
