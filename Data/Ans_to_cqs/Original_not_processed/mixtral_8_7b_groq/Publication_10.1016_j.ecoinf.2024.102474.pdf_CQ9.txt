Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the data used in the study was provided as part of the EarthNet2021 Challenge and consists of 23,904 training datacubes located across Europe. The datacubes are remote sensing data from the Sentinel 2 mission and weather data from E-OBS.

It is also mentioned that the models were implemented using the deep learning framework PyTorch Lightning, which is built on top of PyTorch, and the hyperparameters were tuned using an Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization procedure. However, there is no information given about where the code or data for this pipeline is stored or shared.

In general, researchers may use various data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF to share and preserve their data. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query.
