Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in the study uses various data formats including raster, vector, and spreadsheet. 

Raster data formats are commonly used in this study. For instance, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used as a raster format to represent vegetation health and cover. Specifically, the MODIS image MOD13Q1 provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is used as the NDVI raster data. Additionally, other raster data formats include the GlobeLand30, ALOS World 3D-30 m provided by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and the China soil map based on the harmonized world soil database (HWSD) version 1.1.

Vector data formats are also used in this study, particularly for the identification of railway and expressway networks. However, the specific vector data format used is not mentioned in the provided context.

Spreadsheet data formats are used to represent grain prices, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and population density. These data formats are essential in calculating the output value per unit area of grain crops in the study area.

It is worth noting that the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) algorithm used in this study requires raster data formats as input. Specifically, the SOFM algorithm is applied to the reconstructed Ecological Service Value (ESV) raster data to allocate research units into different ES bundles based on spatial similarities.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in this study primarily uses raster data formats, with some use of vector and spreadsheet data formats.
