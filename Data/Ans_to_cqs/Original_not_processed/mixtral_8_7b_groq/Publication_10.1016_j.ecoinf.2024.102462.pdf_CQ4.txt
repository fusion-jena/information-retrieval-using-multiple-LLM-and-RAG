Answer:::

The context provided does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques used, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does mention that new images are generated by applying transformations to the existing data, which suggests that these common techniques were used.

Data augmentation is a technique used to expand a dataset without acquiring additional data by applying transformations to the existing data. This generates new images that are slightly different while maintaining the same class. The main purpose of data augmentation is to allow for the training of larger networks and to balance the data. When the training set is unbalanced, the trained models become biased towards larger classes. Augmentation can be used to increase the data for classes with less representation, allowing all classes to be learned in a uniform manner.

In the context provided, data augmentation was used to modify the class balance by increasing the number of examples for underrepresented classes. This resulted in an overall accuracy increase for all networks, with ConvNeXt obtaining the highest accuracy of 79.58%. Although TPR values for larger classes were reduced, the metrics for smaller classes significantly improved, leading to a better overall accuracy.

Table 4 in the context shows the number of patches and true positive/false positive rate values for each deep learning network and species. The upper half of the table shows the results without data augmentation, while the lower half shows the results with data augmentation. The results show that data augmentation had a positive impact on the performance of the deep learning networks.

In summary, while the specific data augmentation techniques used are not mentioned in the provided context, it is likely that common techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling were used. Data augmentation was used to modify the class balance and increase the overall accuracy of the deep learning networks.
