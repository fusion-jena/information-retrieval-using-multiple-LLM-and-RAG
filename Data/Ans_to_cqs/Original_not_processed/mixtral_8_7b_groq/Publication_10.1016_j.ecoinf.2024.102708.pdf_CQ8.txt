Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. The text mentions that the study used a YOLOv5s model for Pacific oyster detection, but it does not specify where the code for this implementation can be found. It is possible that the code repository is not publicly available, or that it was not included in the given text. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
