Answer: The deep learning model was built using the Keras library, which is a high-level neural networks API written in Python. As the back-end engine for Keras, TensorFlow with GPU execution was used. TensorFlow is an open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence projects, and it allows for the use of GPUs to speed up computations. Therefore, both Keras and TensorFlow were used in the development of this deep learning model.
