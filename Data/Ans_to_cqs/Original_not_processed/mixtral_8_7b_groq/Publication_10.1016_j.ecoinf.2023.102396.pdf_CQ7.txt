Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context focuses on the methodology used for feature-based and shape-match classifications of animal population time series, specifically for rabbit populations.

However, in general, when developing a deep learning model, it is common practice to split the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

The criteria for splitting the data can vary depending on the specific problem, dataset size, and domain knowledge. Some common approaches include:

1. Random sampling: This method involves randomly splitting the dataset into the three subsets. It is simple and unbiased but may not be suitable for time series data or when there are underlying patterns or trends in the data.
2. Time-based splitting: For time series data, it is common to use a time-based split, where a certain time period is used for training, another for validation, and another for testing. This ensures that the model is tested on unseen data and helps evaluate its ability to generalize to new time points.
3. Stratified sampling: When the dataset has imbalanced classes, stratified sampling can be used to ensure that each subset has a representative distribution of classes. This helps prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used for splitting the data in their deep learning model, common approaches for splitting datasets include random sampling, time-based splitting, and stratified sampling. The choice of splitting method depends on the specific problem, dataset size, and domain knowledge.
