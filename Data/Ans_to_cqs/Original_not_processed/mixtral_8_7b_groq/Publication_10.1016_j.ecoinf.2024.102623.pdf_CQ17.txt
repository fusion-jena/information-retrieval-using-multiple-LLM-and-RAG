Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of dropout as a regularization method in the deep learning pipeline. Dropout is a technique that prevents overfitting by randomly dropping out, or deactivating, a proportion of neurons during training. This helps to ensure that the model does not rely too heavily on any single neuron or group of neurons, thereby promoting generalization and reducing overfitting.

Dropout is specifically mentioned in the context as being employed in the deep learning architecture used for species distribution modeling. The authors state that they introduce dropout in their model, but they do not provide details about the dropout rate or how it is implemented. However, the reference to dropout in the context indicates that it is being used as a regularization method to prevent overfitting.

The context does not explicitly mention other regularization methods, such as L2 regularization, which adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights and promote generalization. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to confirm whether L2 regularization or any other regularization methods are being used in addition to dropout.
