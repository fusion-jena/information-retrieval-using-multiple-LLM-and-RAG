Answer:::

 Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context mainly focuses on the description of the proposed deep learning-based method called YWnet for underwater small target detection. It explains the use of the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), the Shuffle Residual Channel Attention and Concatenation Module (SRC3), and the Cross-Resolution Feature Pyramid Network (CRFPN) for feature extraction, enhancement, and fusion. The study also compares YWnet with other advanced algorithms using the URPC dataset. However, there is no mention of the code repository link for the implementation of the proposed method.
