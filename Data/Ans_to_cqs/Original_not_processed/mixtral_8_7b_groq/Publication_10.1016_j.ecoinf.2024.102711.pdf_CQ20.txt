The provided context does not include information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The focus of the text is on data-driven models, specifically Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, and their hyperparameter tuning process.

However, it is mentioned that k-fold cross-validation is used for hyperparameter tuning, and this process involves training and evaluating the model's performance multiple times. Therefore, it can be inferred that access to sufficient computational resources is necessary to carry out this process efficiently.

In general, when training deep learning models, hardware resources such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) are often used to accelerate the training process due to their ability to perform parallel computations. These hardware resources can significantly reduce the training time compared to using only a Central Processing Unit (CPU).

Therefore, while the provided context does not specify the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, it is reasonable to assume that access to sufficient computational resources, such as GPUs or TPUs, would be necessary for efficient training and hyperparameter tuning of deep learning models.
