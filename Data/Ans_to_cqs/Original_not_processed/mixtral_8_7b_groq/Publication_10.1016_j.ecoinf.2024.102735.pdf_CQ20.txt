The provided context does not give information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text mentions the use of machine learning models such as random forest (RF), multilayer perceptron (MLP), long-short term memory (LSTM), and support vector regression (SVR) for predicting algal-related parameters. However, it does not specify whether these models were trained using GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query based on the given context.
