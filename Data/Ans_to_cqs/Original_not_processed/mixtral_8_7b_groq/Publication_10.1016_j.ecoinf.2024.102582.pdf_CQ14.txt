Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization methods.

The context mainly discusses the study of mangrove forest landscape evolution using the Optimal Parcel Grid Decomposition (OPGD) method. It explains the concept of the q value, which is a spatial variance of a factor indicator, and how it is calculated. The study identified the optimal spatial scale threshold for the detection of factors driving mangrove forest landscape evolution as 270 m Ã— 270 m.

However, the optimization of hyperparameters, which is crucial for any machine learning model, is not discussed. Hyperparameter optimization is the process of choosing the best hyperparameters for a model to minimize the validation error. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
