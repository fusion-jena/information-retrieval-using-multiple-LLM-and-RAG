Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include the learning rate, batch size, and the number of times the model was trained. The learning rate, which is the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function, was set to 1e-3 for all networks except ResNet_v2, where it was set to 1e-5. Batch size, which is the number of training examples used in one iteration, was set to 128. The model was trained for 50-60 times using a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU, Nvidia 1080ti, US) for two hours and 10 min.

Additionally, the study used a network called BatNet, which has 22 convolutional layers for extracting useful acoustic features and eight shortcut connections between layers to avoid the problem of information loss as layer number increases. The key parameter settings of BatNet include batch size equal to 64.

It is important to note that the study also used other networks for comparison, but the specific hyperparameters for those networks are not provided in the context.
