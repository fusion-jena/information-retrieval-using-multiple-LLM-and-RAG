Answer:

In the deep learning pipeline for goat vocalization detection, the raw data is collected using dedicated devices such as cameras and microphones in the partner farms. This is stated in the project description where it is mentioned that the project is divided into four phases, and phase 1 involves the collection of basic data through a one-year-long data harvesting campaign using dedicated devices in the partner farms. However, the context does not provide information on whether surveys or public datasets are used in the data collection process. Therefore, it is not possible to confirm if these methods are utilized in the deep learning pipeline.
