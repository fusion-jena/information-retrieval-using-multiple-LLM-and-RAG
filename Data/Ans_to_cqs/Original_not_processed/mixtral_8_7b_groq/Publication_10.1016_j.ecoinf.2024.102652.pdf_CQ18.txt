Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of an early stopping function and the tracking of accuracy over epochs. Specifically, the training process is halted if there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs, which helps to prevent overfitting and reduce training time. Additionally, the accuracy is tracked throughout the 100 epochs, allowing for the monitoring of model performance and the identification of any trends or issues that may arise during training. This approach ensures that the model is not only trained effectively, but also that its performance is carefully monitored and evaluated throughout the training process.
