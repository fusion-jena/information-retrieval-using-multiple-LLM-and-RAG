Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context focuses on the use of multiple-instance learning algorithms for detecting invasive plant species using multispectral airborne and satellite imagery. It mentions the use of MATLAB for classification and specific data sets, but it does not provide a link to the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
