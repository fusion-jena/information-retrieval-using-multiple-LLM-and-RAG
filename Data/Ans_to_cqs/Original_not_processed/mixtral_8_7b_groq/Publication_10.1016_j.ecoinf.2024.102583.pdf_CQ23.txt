The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does discuss the use of heterogeneous ensemble techniques to optimize the performance of five base learners and mitigate potential overfitting in the context of landslide susceptibility modeling (LSM).

Ensemble techniques, which combine the predictions of multiple models, can help improve the generalizability of a model by reducing the risk of overfitting and increasing the robustness of the predictions. In the study, the authors used a weighted average (WA) ensemble technique to combine the predictions of five base learners: Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

The WA ensemble technique calculates the weighted sum of the predictions of the base learners, where the weights are determined based on the performance of each model. This approach allows the ensemble to leverage the strengths of each individual model and produce more accurate predictions.

Additionally, the study used a diverse dataset and cross-validation to further improve the generalizability of the models. The dataset included various factors that could influence landslide susceptibility, such as soil type, slope, aspect, curvature, distance to roads, and land use. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into training and testing sets and evaluating the performance of the model on the testing set. This process is repeated multiple times with different subsets of the data, which helps ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data.

While the context does not specifically mention stratified splitting, it is a common technique used in machine learning to ensure that the training and testing sets are representative of the overall population. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on a specific variable (such as landslide occurrence) and then randomly selecting samples from each subgroup to create the training and testing sets. This approach helps ensure that the training and testing sets have similar proportions of the variable of interest, which can improve the generalizability of the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, it does discuss the use of ensemble techniques, cross-validation, and a diverse dataset, which can all contribute to improving the generalizability of a model. However, it does not mention the use of stratified splitting.
