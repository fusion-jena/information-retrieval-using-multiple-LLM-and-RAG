The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context of the models used for SPAD value modeling. However, it does mention that the dataset was divided into a training dataset and a testing dataset, and that the models were fitted using the training dataset and further validated using the testing dataset. This suggests that one possible criterion for determining when training is complete could be when the model's performance on the training dataset is satisfactory and its performance on the testing dataset is similar, indicating that the model is not overfitting to the training data.

In addition, the context also mentions that a simple linear model (LM), a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution (GLM), and an artificial neural network (ANN) were used for SPAD value modeling. Different criteria may be used to determine when training is complete for different types of models. For example, for a linear model, training may be considered complete when the model's coefficients have converged to stable values. For a neural network, training may be considered complete when the model's performance on the training dataset stops improving or when the model begins to overfit, as indicated by a divergence between the model's performance on the training dataset and the testing dataset.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the models used for SPAD value modeling, it suggests that one possible criterion is when the model's performance on the training dataset is satisfactory and its performance on the testing dataset is similar. Additionally, different criteria may be used for different types of models.
