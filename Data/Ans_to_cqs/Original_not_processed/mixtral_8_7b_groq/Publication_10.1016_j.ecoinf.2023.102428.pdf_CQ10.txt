Answer:::
I regret to inform you that there is no direct link to a code repository provided in the context. The text focuses on describing the use of a deep learning pipeline that integrates the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm and Markov chain for future land use land cover (LULC) simulation. However, it does not share any specific code repository details such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

The text does mention various sources and studies that have been used in the research, but these do not include a code repository link either. These sources include the InVEST user guide, a meta-analysis of published documents, and several research papers.

Therefore, I am unable to provide you with the requested link to the code repository. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
