Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the use of deep learning models for estimating forest aboveground biomass (AGB) in the mentioned studies. However, the context does provide information about the use of nonparametric machine learning models such as AdaBoost, random decision forest (RF), multilayer neural network (NET), and Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes) for this purpose.

In the study by Xue (2015), the author used a multilayer neural network (NET) model to estimate hardwood forest biomass in mountainous and bottomland environments using LiDAR and machine learning. However, the context does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used in the neural network model.

In the study by Zhang et al. (2019), the authors used a deep learning-based retrieval method for forest biomass estimation. However, the context does not provide specific details about the deep learning model used, including the hyperparameters.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for forest AGB estimation. I recommend referring to the original research articles for more detailed information on the deep learning models and their hyperparameters.

Answer:::
 The provided context does not contain specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for forest aboveground biomass estimation. The context mentions the use of deep learning-based retrieval for forest biomass estimation (Zhang et al., 2019) but does not provide details about the deep learning model or its hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
