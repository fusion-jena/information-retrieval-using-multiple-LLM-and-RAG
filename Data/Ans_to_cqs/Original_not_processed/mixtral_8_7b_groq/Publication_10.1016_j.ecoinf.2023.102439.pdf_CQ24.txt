Answer:::

The provided pieces of context do not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, they do mention the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs), including the NARX model, in modeling studies.

ANNs, including deep learning models, often involve randomness during the training process, such as the random initialization of weights and biases. This randomness can lead to different results in each training run, even with the same data and model architecture. To address this, researchers often employ various strategies to manage randomness and ensure the reproducibility of their results.

One common strategy is setting a fixed random seed value. By explicitly specifying a seed value, researchers can ensure that the random number generator used in the model produces the same sequence of random numbers in each run. This helps maintain consistency in the training process, allowing researchers to compare results across different training runs.

While the context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, it is reasonable to assume that researchers employ such strategies when working with ANNs, given the inherent randomness in these models. Additionally, the context highlights the use of wavelet analysis in conjunction with the NARX ANN model to enhance performance. Wavelet analysis, a signal processing technique, can help reduce the impact of randomness by providing a more robust representation of the input data.

In summary, although the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is common practice for researchers to use a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility in ANN training. Furthermore, the application of wavelet analysis can help mitigate the effects of randomness by providing a more robust data representation.
