Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the scarcity of labeled clean bioacoustic recordings poses a challenge for training deep learning-based models for bioacoustic noise reduction. To address this issue, the authors propose using a bird sound noise reduction network based on deep feature loss.

While the context does not discuss data bias specifically, it does mention the importance of diverse data collection. In the context of bioacoustic noise reduction, collecting data from various types of noises and different frequency bands of bird species is essential for thoroughly investigating the application of deep learning bioacoustic noise reduction methods.

Therefore, while not explicitly stated, the context suggests that diverse data collection is one technique that can be used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does not mention any other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling.
