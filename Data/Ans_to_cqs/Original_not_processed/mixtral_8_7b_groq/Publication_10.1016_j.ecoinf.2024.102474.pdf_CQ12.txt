Answer:::

The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Transformer-based architecture. This information can be inferred from the context that states, "In our efforts to use a Transformer version for video prediction...", and the fact that the authors mention multiple advantages of Transformers over recurrent architectures. The authors had attempted to implement a Transformer model for their specific task but encountered memory limitations. Other types of models mentioned in the context include Convolutional LSTM networks and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), but they are not indicated to be part of the pipeline in question.
