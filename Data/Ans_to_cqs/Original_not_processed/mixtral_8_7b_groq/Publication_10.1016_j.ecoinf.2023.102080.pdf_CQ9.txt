Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository where the pipeline's data is available. The context refers to the "covsel" R package, which is used for embedded covariate selection in species distribution modeling. The package has three functions: "covsel.filteralgo()" for collinearity filtering, "covsel.embed()" for model-specific embedding, and "covsel.filter()" as a wrapper function for the collinearity filtering algorithm.

The context includes details about the input data and arguments for each function, such as species presence/absence data, continuous covariate data, weights (optional), and correlation coefficient threshold for identifying collinearity. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository.

Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the given context.
