Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.

However, I can provide some general context about the topic discussed in the text, which is the development of a grassland fire index for mountain regions like the Alps. This work involves using data layers with a spatial resolution of 1 Ã— 1 km, such as FWI (Fire Weather Index) and FFMC (Fine Fuel Moisture Code), and applying a nine-cell approach to smooth existing data inaccuracies within single grid cells. Additionally, researchers are exploring the use of a high-resolution data layer of actual snow cover to improve the prediction accuracy of winter and spring fires.

While these techniques are not directly related to optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines, they do involve data processing and analysis techniques that could be used as part of a larger data-driven approach to predicting grassland fires. For example, data preprocessing techniques such as normalization, feature scaling, and data augmentation could be used to prepare the FWI, FFMC, and snow cover data for use in a deep learning model. Similarly, various optimization algorithms could be used to train the model, such as SGD, Adam, or other gradient-based optimization techniques.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly answer the query about optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest that data processing and analysis techniques are being used to develop a grassland fire index. These techniques could be combined with optimization algorithms as part of a larger deep learning pipeline to improve the accuracy of grassland fire predictions.
