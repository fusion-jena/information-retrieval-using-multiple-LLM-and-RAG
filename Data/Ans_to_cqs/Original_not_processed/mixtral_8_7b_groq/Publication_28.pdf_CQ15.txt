Answer:::

The optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants such as Adam.

In the context of Variational Autoencoder (VAE) structure, SGD on Backpropagation (BP) is used to manage stochastic input. However, there are no stochastic units within the networks. The solution to this is called the "reparameterization trick," which transfers the sampling to the input layer. This is done by sampling ∈ ~ N(0, I) and then calculating pmodel(z|x) = μ(x) + θ1/2(x) × e, where μ(x) and θ(x) are the mean and covariance of (z| x). The loss function L(q) is then calculated as L(q) = Ee∼N(0,I)pmodel(x|z).

In the deep learning pipeline for satellite image classification, various optimization techniques can be employed. For instance, in the study by Li et al. (2014), a free search krill herd algorithm for function optimization is used. In the work by Li et al. (2020), a multi-label remote sensing image scene classification using a convolutional neural network and a graph neural network is presented, but the specific optimization technique is not mentioned.

In the study by Liu et al. (2020), feature augmented convolutional neural nets for satellite image classification are developed. Here, the EfficientNetB0 model, which outperformed other techniques, is utilized. EfficientNetB0 utilizes the inverted bottleneck convolutional layer, which is established in the MobileNetV2 method. This framework decreased calculation by the factor of 2 as related to normal convolutional, in which f implies the filter size. However, the optimization technique used in training EfficientNetB0 is not specified.

In the study by Hassan et al. (2021), a detailed comparative outcomes analysis of the PTDLEN-VAE method takes place with other techniques on the AIM dataset. However, the optimization technique used in PTDLEN-VAE is not mentioned in the provided context.

Therefore, while SGD and its variants are commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning, the specific optimization techniques used in the studies mentioned above are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
