Answer:::

The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context is not explicitly named as one of the standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the dataset is specifically created for the purpose of training a deep learning model to identify pollen species using multispectral imaging flow cytometry.

The dataset consists of 35,573 images for each of the 12 channels, covering 35 species, resulting in a total of 426,876 images. This dataset was split into three sets for training, validation, and testing in the proportions 80 : 10 : 10. All images were center cropped to an equally sized rectangle. In order to gain a more robust and better generalizing classifier, the images in the training set were additionally augmented in various ways, including flipping horizontally and vertically, adjusting brightness, saturation, contrast, and hue.

Therefore, while the dataset is not one of the standard benchmark datasets, it is a rich and diverse dataset specifically tailored to the problem of pollen species identification using deep learning.
