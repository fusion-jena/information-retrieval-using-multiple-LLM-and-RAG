The provided context discusses the use of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, specifically a NARX feedback ANN model, to define vegetation biomass density for a certain period. However, it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training the model. 

However, based on common practices in deep learning and the information provided, it can be inferred that some preprocessing steps were likely involved. 

Firstly, the input data includes LST, temperature, and precipitation parameters. These parameters might have been cleaned to remove any inconsistencies or errors. Data cleaning is a crucial step in any data analysis to ensure the quality of the input data.

Secondly, the output layer of the ANN model uses EVI data. EVI, or Enhanced Vegetation Index, is a numerical indicator of vegetation growth. This index is often normalized to a range between -1 and 1, or 0 and 1, to make it easier to interpret and compare. Therefore, it can be assumed that the EVI data was normalized before being used in the model.

Thirdly, the number of neurons in the hidden layer of the ANN model was incrementally adjusted to determine the optimal configuration. This process might involve some form of scaling or standardization to ensure that the number of neurons is appropriately adjusted.

Lastly, the model's performance was evaluated using several statistical metrics, including Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). These metrics require the data to be in a consistent format, which might involve some preprocessing steps such as scaling or normalization.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model, it can be inferred that data cleaning, normalization, and possibly scaling were involved based on common practices in deep learning.
