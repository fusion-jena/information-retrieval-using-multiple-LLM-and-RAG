Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline described in the given context uses audio files as the input data format. The pipeline involves pre-processing these audio files using four steps, namely, applying a low pass filter, down-sampling, extracting audio segments, and converting the segments into spectrograms. The low pass filter is applied to reduce aliasing artifacts, and the cut-off rate is selected based on the maximum frequency of the respective species' call. Down-sampling is done to reduce computational requirements, and the nyquist rate is set to the maximum frequency for each species' call. Audio segments are extracted based on the annotations for both classes, and the length of the segments is not specified in the context. Spectrograms are generated using the Librosa library, which represents the time-varying spectrum of the audio signal. Therefore, the input data format used in this deep learning pipeline is audio files, and the pre-processing steps involve converting the audio files into spectrograms. The output of the pipeline is a softmax output that predicts the presence or absence of a particular species' call in the input audio file.
