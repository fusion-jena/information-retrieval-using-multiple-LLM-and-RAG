Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model in the given context is bird sound noise reduction. This model is designed to denoise noisy bird sound signals and improve the quality of the recordings. The authors construct a deep learning environment based on Python, Tensorflow, GPU, and CUDA under the Windows operating system for training the model. They use the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10 and compare the denoising results of the deep feature loss-based bird sound noise reduction network with several other bioacoustics noise reduction algorithms, such as SEGAN, WebRTC, wavelet transform, Wiener filter, and MMSE STSA algorithms. The model is trained for 50 epochs, and the entire training set is presented in a random order during each epoch, with one noisy bird sound signal per iteration. The framework of the bird sound noise reduction network based on deep feature loss is presented in Figure 4.

The training of the bird sound noise reduction network based on deep feature loss involves the audio classification loss network's first M-th shallowest network layers' feature activation. The feature activation of the m-th feature layer is represented by Φm, the clean bird sound signal is represented by β, and the processed bird sound signal generated by the noise reduction network during training is represented by g(x; θ). The initial value of the weight λm is set to 1, and after 10 training iterations, the relative value of ‖Φm(β) - Φm(g(x; θ))‖ is set to 1.

Therefore, the deep learning model's purpose is to reduce noise in bird sound signals, and it is trained using the audio classification loss network's feature activation and the clean bird sound signal. The processed bird sound signal is generated by the noise reduction network during training, and the relative value of the feature activation difference is set to 1 after 10 training iterations. The denoising results of this model are compared with several other bioacoustics noise reduction algorithms to evaluate its performance.
