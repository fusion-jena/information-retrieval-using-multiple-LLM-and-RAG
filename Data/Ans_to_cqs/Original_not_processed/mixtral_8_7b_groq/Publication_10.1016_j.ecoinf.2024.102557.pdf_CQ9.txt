After reviewing the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that a fungal database was used, which resulted from the sampling of more than 100 permanent sampling plots over 20 years in Mediterranean forest ecosystems. This database was used in conjunction with predictive models based on machine learning algorithms to estimate current and future productivity patterns of fungal species under different climate change scenarios and bioclimatic regions.

It is possible that the fungal database used in this study is not publicly available due to restrictions on sharing data related to specific study sites or species. In some cases, data may be made available upon request to the authors or through a data sharing agreement.

Additionally, the context mentions several studies that used machine learning or deep learning techniques in ecology and conservation, but none of them provide information about the data repository of their deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query, and I recommend contacting the authors of the study for more information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.

Answer::: 
No specific information is provided in the given context regarding the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. It is recommended to contact the authors for more information.
