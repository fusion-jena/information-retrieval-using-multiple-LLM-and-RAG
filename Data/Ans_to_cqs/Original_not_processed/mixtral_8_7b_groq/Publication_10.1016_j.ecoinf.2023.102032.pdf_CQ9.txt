Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context includes a Medium article and a piece of an abstract from a publication in Ecological Informatics, both of which discuss the use of machine learning and Sentinel-2 data for cloud detection and wetland health assessment in East Africa. However, neither source provides information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
