Answer:

The text provided gives information about the data labeling process for a deep learning pipeline designed for detecting pollen-bearing bees. However, it does not explicitly mention specific techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. But based on the context, we can infer that bounding box annotation was used.

In the data labeling process, images were manually annotated to create a dataset. This involved labeling each image with relevant information and marking the location of objects within the image using bounding boxes. This is evident in Figure 3, which shows an example of the data labeling process with bounding boxes around bees.

Furthermore, the text mentions that an object detection network (YOLOv5) was trained on this manually annotated subset. YOLOv5 is a well-known object detection model that uses bounding box predictions to identify objects within an image. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that bounding box annotation was the primary data annotation technique used in this deep learning pipeline.

As for instance segmentation, there is no explicit mention or evidence suggesting its use in this particular pipeline.
