Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, the paper does mention the use of batch normalization as a preprocessing step for the input data.

Batch normalization is a technique used to normalize the input features in a neural network by re-centering and re-scaling them to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. This technique can help improve the training of deep neural networks by reducing internal covariate shift, which is the change in the distribution of the network's inputs during training.

The paper also mentions the use of a constraint factor for water and settlements, which are determined by manual interpretation and do not require simulation. However, this is not a data augmentation technique, but rather a way to incorporate external knowledge into the model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the data augmentation techniques of flipping, rotating, and scaling do not appear to have been applied in the deep learning pipeline.
