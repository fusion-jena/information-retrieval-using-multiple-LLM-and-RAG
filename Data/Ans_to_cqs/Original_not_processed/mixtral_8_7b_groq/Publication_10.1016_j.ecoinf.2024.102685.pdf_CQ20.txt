Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context focuses on the use of statistical analysis, specifically the random forest classification method, for ecological studies.

However, it is generally common practice to use specialized hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which significantly speeds up the training process compared to using a Central Processing Unit (CPU) alone.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific information on the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model, it can be inferred that GPUs or TPUs were likely used due to their suitability for deep learning tasks.
