Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a particular deep learning model. However, there are some general techniques mentioned in the literature that are commonly used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models.

One such technique is using a diverse dataset for training the model. A diverse dataset can help the model to learn a wider range of patterns and relationships in the data, which can improve its ability to generalize to new, unseen data. For example, in the context of machine learning for automated annotation and analysis in biology, high-quality data is essential (Egnor and Branson, 2
