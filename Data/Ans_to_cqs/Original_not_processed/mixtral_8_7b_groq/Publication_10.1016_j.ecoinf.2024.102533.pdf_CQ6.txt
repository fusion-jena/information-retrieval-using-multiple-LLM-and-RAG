Based on the provided context, it appears that there are several preprocessing steps taken before implementing a deep learning model for automated fish grading. However, data normalization, which is often an important step in preprocessing, is mentioned as unnecessary.

The first step mentioned is clustering the freshness data using six body parts parameters. This step involves determining the most suitable number of clusters from a previous stage and using it as the standard for the proposed number of freshness classes. Each species then attains several freshness classes based on its freshness stronghold. The data is grouped using a clustering method to automatically determine the freshness class based on the dataset. This method partitions data where similar data are grouped in one cluster, while dissimilar data are separated into other clusters.

The next step is evaluating the clustering results. However, the context does not provide details on how this evaluation is carried out.

The papers referenced in the context also provide insights into the preprocessing steps taken. For instance, Jayasundara et al. (2023) developed a deep learning model for automated fish grading and mentioned that they used a dataset containing 12 features, including color, texture, and geometric features. However, they did not provide details on any preprocessing steps taken.

Kunjulakshmi et al. (2020) developed a portable, non-destructive freshness indicative sensor for Indian Mackerel stored under ice. They mentioned that they used a dataset containing 13 features, including pH, temperature, and conductivity. They normalized the data using z-score normalization before implementing their machine learning model.

Lalabadi et al. (2020) categorized fish freshness from eyes and gills color features using multi-class artificial neural networks and support vector machines. They normalized the data using min-max scaling before implementing their machine learning model.

Mokrani et al. (2018) studied the effect of fish farming conditions on European sea bass quality and shelf life during storage in ice. They mentioned that they used a dataset containing 11 features, including pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. However, they did not provide details on any preprocessing steps taken.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention any preprocessing steps other than clustering, the referenced papers suggest that normalization or scaling may be necessary preprocessing steps before implementing a deep learning model for automated fish grading. However, the necessity of these steps may depend on the features present in the dataset.
