Answer:::

The provided context does not directly answer the query regarding the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of various types of data in studies related to groundwater resources and land subsidence.

From the context, it can be inferred that the following methods might be used for collecting raw data:

1. Surveys: In the study by Rahmati et al. (2019), tree-based machine learning algorithms were used for land subsidence modeling. While the context does not explicitly mention the use of surveys, they could be one of the methods used to collect data for this study.
2. Sensors: Depth of groundwater (DTGW), slope, profile curvature, plain curvature, aspect, topographic wetness index (TWI), distance from dam (DFD), land cover (LC), flow direction, and flow accumulation are some of the parameters mentioned in the context. These parameters could be measured using various sensors, such as groundwater level sensors, slope sensors, curvature sensors, and TWI sensors.
3. Public datasets: The context mentions the use of data from Int. Arch. Health Sci. 5 (3), 68–71 and Sci. Total Environ. 672, 239–252. These could be public datasets related to groundwater resources and land subsidence.
4. Remote sensing: Normalized difference salinity index (NDSI) is mentioned in the context, which could be derived from remote sensing data.

Therefore, it can be concluded that surveys, sensors, public datasets, and remote sensing are some of the methods that might be used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline related to groundwater resources and land subsidence. However, the specific methods used would depend on the research question and the availability of data.
