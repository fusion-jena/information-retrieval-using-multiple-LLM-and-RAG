Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in the described study does not involve any of the commonly used datasets in deep learning such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, this study uses two specific datasets identified as CS and NW.

The CS and NW datasets were used in a machine learning pipeline that involved the use of Random Forest models (RI and RY). For both the CS and NW datasets, the same initial parameters were set for the analysis, followed by a grid search to obtain hyperparameters with the highest accuracy. The hyperparameters for both CS and NW models were a learning rate of 0.05 and a maximum tree depth of 4.

In addition to the RI models, RY models were also used, but with different hyperparameters. The RY models had a slower learning rate of 0.005, and the NW model had a very shallow tree with a tree depth of 2.

The study further explains that the datasets were split into train, test, and validation sets. The model was built, tested, and optimized using the train and validation sets, and the model's performance was confirmed using the test set.

The data splitting approach for the RY models differed from the RI models. For the RY models, individual observations were grouped according to the year of capture, and years were randomly selected for inclusion in the train and test datasets. This approach was taken to ensure that the model was tested using previously unseen combinations of explanatory variables, providing a more robust test of model performance.

Therefore, the datasets used in this study are not the standard deep learning datasets, but rather two specific datasets identified as CS and NW.
