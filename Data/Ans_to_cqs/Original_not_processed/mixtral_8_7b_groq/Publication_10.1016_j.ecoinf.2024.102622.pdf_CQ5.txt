Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, the context does provide information about various studies that have used remote sensing data for different agricultural and ecological applications.

For instance, the study by Yang et al. (2023) used Sentinel-2 data for rice disease identification. Similarly, the study by Yin, C.Y.C. et al. (2016) used Landsat-8 OLI data for estimating chlorophyll content in arid grasslands. The study by Yue et al. (2019) used UAV ultrahigh-ground-resolution image textures and vegetation indices for estimating winter-wheat above-ground biomass. The study by You et al. (2021) created 10-m crop type maps in northeast China during 2017-2019 using unspecified data. The study by Fang et al. (2024) developed a total phosphorus concentration retrieval method based on two-line classification in lakes and reservoirs across China using unspecified data.

Furthermore, the context also mentions studies that have used hyperspectral imaging technology with machine and deep learning methodology for agricultural applications (Khan et al., 2022), and a study that used a single-board computer as a low-cost instrument for SPAD value estimation through color images and chlorophyll-related spectral indices (Kˇríˇzov´a et al., 2022). However, these studies do not specify the exact datasets used.

Therefore, while the context does not provide information on the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it does provide evidence of the use of remote sensing data and hyperspectral imaging technology for various agricultural and ecological applications using machine and deep learning methodologies.
