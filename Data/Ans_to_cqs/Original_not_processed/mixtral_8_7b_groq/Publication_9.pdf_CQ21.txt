Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training for the Sashimi toolkit. However, it is mentioned that the trained models will be used for fish segmentation and their efficacy will be evaluated.

In the context of image segmentation, some common postprocessing steps include:

1. Saliency maps: A saliency map is a visualization technique that highlights the important regions in the image based on the model's predictions. It can help in understanding the model's focus and identifying potential issues.

2. Metrics calculation: Various evaluation metrics like Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, Precision, Recall, and F1 score can be calculated to assess the performance of the segmentation model. These metrics provide a quantitative measure of the overlap between the predicted segmentation mask and the ground truth annotation.

3. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model. In the context of segmentation, it can be used to compare the predicted classes (foreground and background) with the ground truth annotations. The confusion matrix can provide insights into false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives, which can be further used to calculate evaluation metrics.

4. Ensembling: Multiple models can be trained and their predictions can be combined to create an ensemble. Ensembling can help in improving the robustness and accuracy of the model.

5. Model pruning and optimization: Postprocessing steps might also include techniques to optimize and prune the model, such as reducing the number of parameters or layers, to make it more efficient for deployment.

Although the provided context does not explicitly mention these postprocessing steps, it is essential to perform such evaluations to ensure the model's performance and applicability for fish segmentation tasks.
