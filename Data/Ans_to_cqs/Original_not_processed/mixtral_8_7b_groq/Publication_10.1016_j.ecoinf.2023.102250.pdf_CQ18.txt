Answer:

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using several metrics, including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Top-1 accuracy, Top-5 accuracy, Top-1 error, and Top-5 error. These metrics are used to evaluate the classification model's accuracy and effectiveness. The formulas for these metrics are presented in the context.

Moreover, the Inception Score (IS) and Frechet Inception Distance (FID) are used to compare the sampled generated spectrogram of different ACGAN models. The IS measures the quality of the generated images, while the FID evaluates the distance between the generated images and the real images. Higher IS and lower FID values indicate better model performance.

In addition, the use of Figures 10 and 11 from the context provides a visual representation of the classification accuracy of different models in Experimental Groups I and II. The bar in these figures represents the Top-1 accuracy for each network group, while the line represents the Top-5 accuracy. These visualizations can be used to monitor the model's performance and compare it with other models during training.

It is also worth noting that the strategy includes the implementation of spectral normalization, LeakyReLU activation function, and dynamic convolutional kernel decomposition proposed by Li et al. in 2021. These techniques aim to reduce the number of parameters in dynamic convolution, improve the classification performance of neural networks, and enhance the quality of the generated images.

Overall, the strategy to monitor the model performance during training involves using various evaluation metrics, visualizations, and techniques to ensure the model's accuracy and effectiveness.
