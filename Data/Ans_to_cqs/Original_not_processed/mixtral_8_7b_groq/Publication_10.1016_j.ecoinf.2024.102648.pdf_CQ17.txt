Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of a penalty method within the framework of artificial neural network (ANN) models to prevent overfitting. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of specific regularization techniques such as dropout or L2 regularization.

In general, overfitting is a common issue in machine learning and deep learning models, where the model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.

Dropout is a regularization technique that is commonly used in deep learning models. It involves randomly dropping out, or setting to zero, a fraction of the neurons in each layer during training. This helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons and promoting the learning of more robust features.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is another regularization technique that adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the model's weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization, it is likely that one or both of these techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting. However, without further information, this is only a hypothesis.
