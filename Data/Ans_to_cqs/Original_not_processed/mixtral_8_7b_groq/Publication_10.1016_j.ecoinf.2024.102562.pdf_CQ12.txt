Answer:::

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline mentioned in the provided context is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the use of the Mask R-CNN model, which is a type of CNN specifically designed for object detection and segmentation tasks. The authors also trained a ResNet-101 network, which is another type of CNN commonly used for image recognition tasks. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning models used in this pipeline are CNNs.
