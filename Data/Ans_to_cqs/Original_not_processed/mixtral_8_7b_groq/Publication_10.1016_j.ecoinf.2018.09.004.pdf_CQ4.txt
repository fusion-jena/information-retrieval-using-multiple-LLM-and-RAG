The provided context does not include information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. It mainly discusses the use of stratiÔ¨Åed cross-validation in experimentation for predicting seagrass existence and family, as well as determining important variables using tree-based methods.

To answer the query, I can provide some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning:

1. Flipping: This technique involves horizontally or vertically flipping images in the dataset. Horizontal flipping is more common and helps the model generalize better, as it can create variations in the input data without changing the original context.

2. Rotating: Rotating images at random angles can help the model learn to recognize features regardless of their orientation. This technique can be useful for images with features that can appear at different angles.

3. Scaling: Scaling or zooming images can help the model learn to recognize features at different scales. This can be useful for images where features can appear at different sizes.

4. Translation: Translating or shifting images by a few pixels in the x and y directions can help the model learn to recognize features even if they are slightly shifted.

5. Color jittering: Changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue of images can help the model learn to recognize features under different lighting conditions or color variations.

6. MixUp: MixUp is a data augmentation technique that combines two images and their corresponding labels, creating a new image with a weighted average of the two original images and a weighted average of the two original labels. This technique can help the model learn to interpolate between different classes and can improve generalization.

These techniques can be applied to the input data during training to increase the diversity of the dataset and help the model learn to recognize features more robustly.
