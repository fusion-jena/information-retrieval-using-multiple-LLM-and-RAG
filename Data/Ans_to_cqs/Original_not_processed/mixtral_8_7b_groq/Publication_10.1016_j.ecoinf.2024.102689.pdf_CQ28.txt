The context does not provide information about the specific platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model. It mentions various tools and technologies used in the development of the model, such as Python, PyTorch, CUDA, and the Anaconda3 virtual environment. However, it does not specify the cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform) that was utilized for deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
