Based on the provided context, the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation) are not mentioned. The text focuses on the evaluation of the effects of machine learning (ML) model performance on tagging efficiency, specifically using a bounding box model for accelerating the data labeling process.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model during the training process, and the testing set is used to assess the model's performance once the training is completed.

Typically, the data is split in an 80-10-10 or 70-15-15 ratio for training, validation, and testing, respectively. The exact split ratio can vary depending on the size and complexity of the dataset. It's also important to ensure that the data is split randomly to avoid any biases in the training, validation, and testing sets.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it is common practice to split the data into training, validation, and testing sets. The split ratio can vary, and it's important to ensure that the data is split randomly to avoid any biases.
