Based on the provided context, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline for constructing soil salinity maps is semantic segmentation. Specifically, the process involves assigning a category label to each pixel of an image using the MU-NET deep learning method. However, the context does not mention any specific techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the provided context does not include information on the use of these specific data annotation techniques.
