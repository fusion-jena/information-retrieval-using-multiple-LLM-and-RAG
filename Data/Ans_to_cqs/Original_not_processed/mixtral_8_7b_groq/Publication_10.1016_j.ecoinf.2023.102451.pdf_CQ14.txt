The context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the EMViT-Net model are optimized. However, it does mention that the model is trained for 100 epochs with the AdamW optimizer and a learning rate of 0.002, and uses the cross-entropy loss function. The specific method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search, is not mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
