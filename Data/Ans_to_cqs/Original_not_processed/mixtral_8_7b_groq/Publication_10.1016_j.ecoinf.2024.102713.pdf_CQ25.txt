Based on the provided context, there is no information given about a deep learning model being used in the CASE system. The text mainly discusses the relational schema of CASE's database, the creation of a multidimensional spatial cube called Captures, and the validation and loading of enriched H. halys captures associated with geo-objects.

Therefore, it is not possible to determine the purpose of a deep learning model in this system, as there is no mention of such a model in the given context.
