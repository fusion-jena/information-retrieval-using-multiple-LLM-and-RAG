Answer:::

The text does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide some details about the learning rate and the number of epochs used during training, which can give us a clue about the optimization method that might have been employed.

The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls how much the weights in the model are adjusted with respect to the estimated error during training. A one-cycle learning rate policy was used in this study, which suggests that the learning rate was not kept constant throughout the training process. Instead, it was varied between a minimum value of 0.000001 and a maximum value of 0.001 over the course of training. This type of learning rate schedule can help the model converge faster and achieve better performance.

The number of epochs is another important hyperparameter that determines how many times the training algorithm will go through the entire training dataset. In this study, the models were trained for 55 epochs. This is a relatively high number of epochs, which suggests that the optimization algorithm used might be one that is able to handle a large number of iterations without getting stuck in local minima or oscillating around the solution.

Based on these details, it is possible that the optimization algorithm used in this study is a variant of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with learning rate scheduling, such as the Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks method proposed by Smith (2018). However, it is also possible that a more advanced optimization algorithm, such as Adam or RMSprop, was used. These algorithms are designed to handle adaptive learning rates and can be more efficient than SGD in some cases.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline, it provides some clues that suggest it might be a variant of SGD with learning rate scheduling or a more advanced optimization algorithm such as Adam or RMSprop.
