Answer:::

The deep learning models in the given context are built using TensorFlow and Keras. TensorFlow is an open-source software library developed by Google for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.

Keras, on the other hand, is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.

In the specific implementation described, Keras is used as a high-level API for building, training, and deploying deep learning models, while TensorFlow serves as the underlying engine for machine learning tasks. The Neural Networks were built from scratch and implemented using TensorFlow (tf) and Keras.

The MCD layers in the model are a modification of the Keras Dropout class, while the layers based on the VBI method derive from the TensorFlow Probability (tfp) module. This demonstrates the use of both Keras and TensorFlow in the construction of different parts of the model.
