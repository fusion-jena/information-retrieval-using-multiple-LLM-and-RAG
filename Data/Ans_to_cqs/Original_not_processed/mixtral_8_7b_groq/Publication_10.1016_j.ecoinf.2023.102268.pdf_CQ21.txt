Answer:::

After the model training, several postprocessing steps can be involved, such as generating saliency maps, calculating various metrics, and creating a confusion matrix. However, based on the provided context, the specific postprocessing steps are a confusion matrix and possibly the calculation of some metrics.

In the context, a confusion matrix is generated for the test data not seen during training (see Figure 9). This matrix is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm in terms of its ability to correctly classify different classes. The confusion matrix shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, from which other metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score can be calculated.

However, there is no explicit mention of generating saliency maps or calculating other metrics in the provided context. Saliency maps are visualizations used to highlight the important features that a model has learned for making its predictions. These maps can be useful for interpreting and understanding the model's decision-making process. Nonetheless, the context does not mention saliency maps or similar interpretation techniques.

In summary, the postprocessing steps mentioned in the provided context are the generation of a confusion matrix for the test data and potentially the calculation of other performance metrics. There is no explicit mention of saliency maps or other interpretation techniques.
