Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model for Procapra przewalskii monitoring using UAV MOT and GMC involves several steps. However, the context does not explicitly mention the steps of model serialization and platform selection. Therefore, the answer will be based on the available information.

Firstly, the YOLOv7 model was chosen as the baseline model to balance the limited computational power and speed of the airborne computer. YOLOv7 is a member of the YOLO family, characterized by faster target detection and a three-module structure. The input module fits the image-related data to the backbone network size, while the backbone module extracts deep features of various sizes. However, the backbone module may lead to potential matching errors when the scale of the target changes. To address this issue, a multiscale feature-extraction network (MSNet) was introduced.

Furthermore, the SORT model was used for tracking and identifying the target objects in a scene with high dynamic density and low training data. However, the MOTA of the SORT model was much lower than that of the Deep SORT model using FENs. Additionally, the number of IDs allocated by the SORT model exceeded the number of IDs allocated by the Deep SORT model, indicating that the FEN network extracts more and richer target information features.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the Deep SORT model using FENs was deployed for tracking and identifying Procapra przewalskii using UAV MOT and GMC. However, the context does not provide information on how the trained deep learning model was serialized or which platform was selected for deployment.

Answer:::

In conclusion, while the context provides information on the selection of the deep learning model, the input module, the backbone module, the header network, and the multiscale feature-extraction network, it does not explicitly mention the steps of model serialization and platform selection. Therefore, the answer is based on the available information, and it can be inferred that the Deep SORT model using FENs was deployed for tracking and identifying Procapra przewalskii using UAV MOT and GMC.
