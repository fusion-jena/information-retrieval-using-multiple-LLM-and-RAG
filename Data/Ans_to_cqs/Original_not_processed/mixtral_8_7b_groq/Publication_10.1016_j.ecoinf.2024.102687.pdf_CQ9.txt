Answer:::

The data repository for the Darksound dataset used in the deep learning pipeline is available on Zenodo. This dataset was built as an open-source and code-based dataset for the evaluation of UML algorithms in the context of ecoacoustics. The dataset was named Darksound and can be downloaded from the general-purpose repository on Zenodo (<https://zenodo.org/records/10512103>). The data acquisition for building the dataset was made using recordings freely available from the Xeno-Canto database, which were in the mp3 format with varying sampling rates. These recordings were resampled to a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz, with the aliasing problem of the recordings handled using a high-quality Fast Fourier Transform-based bandlimited interpolation.
