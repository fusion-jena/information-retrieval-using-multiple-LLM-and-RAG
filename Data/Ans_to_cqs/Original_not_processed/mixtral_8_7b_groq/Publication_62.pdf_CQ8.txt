Answer:::

The provided context does not specify where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is available, such as on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. However, it mentions that the code used to define and train the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be found in the authors' Mathematica notebooks. There are four Mathematica notebooks provided as supplementary materials, two of which are used to define and train the unstained/stained CNN, and the other two are used for the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN. These notebooks are available for download in the supplementary materials section.

Annotated versions of the notebooks are also provided in PDF format. The article provides a link to the supplementary materials section, where the notebooks can be downloaded. However, there is no mention of a version control system or code repository where the development of the pipeline can be tracked over time.

Therefore, while the notebooks used to define and train the CNNs are available for download, the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
