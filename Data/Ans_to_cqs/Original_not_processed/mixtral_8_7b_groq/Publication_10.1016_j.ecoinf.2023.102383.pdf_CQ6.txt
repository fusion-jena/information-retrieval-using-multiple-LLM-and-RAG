The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models for object detection in UAV thermal images, specifically focusing on the use of Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and Residual Neural Networks (ResNet). While the text does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, it does imply certain preprocessing techniques.

In the context, UAV thermal images are used as input for the deep learning models. These images likely undergo preprocessing steps before being fed into the model. For instance, thermal images might need to be normalized to a certain temperature range to ensure consistent input. Additionally, the images may need to be resized or scaled to fit the input dimensions of the deep learning model.

The text also discusses the use of ResNet models with varying numbers of layers, including ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, ResNet101, and ResNet152. These models are built using "stages," which are sets of convolution layers that output feature maps with different resolutions. The resolution of each feature map is progressively reduced, while the number of bands is increased. This process implies a form of preprocessing within the model itself, as the input data is transformed into feature maps through convolution operations.

Furthermore, the text describes how the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) complements feature maps from different layers to enhance object detection. This process involves upsampling and downsampling feature maps, as well as element-wise addition and 3 Ã— 3 convolutional operations. These steps can be considered preprocessing techniques as they transform the feature maps to better suit the object detection task.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention common preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning, it does imply certain preprocessing techniques. These include normalizing thermal images to a specific temperature range, resizing or scaling images to fit the input dimensions of the deep learning model, and transforming input data into feature maps through convolution operations within the ResNet model. Additionally, the FPN component involves preprocessing techniques such as upsampling, downsampling, and element-wise addition to enhance object detection.
