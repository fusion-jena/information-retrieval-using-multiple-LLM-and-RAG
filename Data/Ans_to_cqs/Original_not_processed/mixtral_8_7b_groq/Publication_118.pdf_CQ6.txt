Answer:::

The provided context discusses the training of a deep learning model for ecoacoustic analysis, but it does not explicitly mention the data pre-processing steps applied before training. However, it can be inferred that some data pre-processing steps were taken based on the information given.

Firstly, the dataset used is described as "highly annotated" and has been used in previous studies. This suggests that the data was cleaned and labeled before being used in this study.

Secondly, the audio spectrograms were constrained to 128 Ã— 128 pixel RGB images with values repeated in each color channel to produce a greyscale image. This implies that some form of normalization or scaling was applied to the audio data to convert it into a suitable format for the deep learning model.

Thirdly, the auto-encoder architecture used was chosen to minimize complications, suggesting that the data was pre-processed to be compatible with this specific architecture.

Therefore, while the specific pre-processing steps are not mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that data cleaning, normalization, and scaling were likely involved before training the deep learning model.
