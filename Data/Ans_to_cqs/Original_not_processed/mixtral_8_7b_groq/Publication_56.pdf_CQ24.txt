Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning techniques for image classification in agricultural applications, specifically using remote sensing data and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM) units. However, the context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value.

In general, deep learning models can contain sources of randomness such as the initialization of weights and biases, the order of training examples, and the use of dropout regularization. To address these sources of randomness, several strategies can be employed:

1. Fixed random seed value: By setting a fixed random seed value, the random number generator used in the deep learning pipeline will produce the same sequence of random numbers, ensuring reproducibility of results. This can be useful for debugging, comparing different models, and reporting results.

2. Multiple runs with different random seeds: To assess the variability of results due to randomness, multiple runs of the deep learning pipeline with different random seed values can be performed. This can help to estimate the variability of model performance and ensure that the results are not overly dependent on a particular random seed value.

3. Data shuffling: When training a deep learning model, the order of training examples can be randomized to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model sees the data in a different order during each epoch. This can help to reduce the impact of the order of training examples on model performance.

4. Dropout regularization: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the outputs of a layer to zero during training, preventing overfitting and promoting the learning of robust features. The dropout rate can be set as a hyperparameter of the model.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these strategies, they are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to handle randomness and ensure reproducibility and robustness of results.
