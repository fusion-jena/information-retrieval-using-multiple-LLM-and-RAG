Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context mainly discusses the limitations and improvements of a classification model based on the Monte Carlo method, and its application to a real wildfire case.

However, the context does mention some strategies that could be used to optimize the performance of the model. These include:

1. Modifying the update criterion to make it differentiable, which would allow the application of machine-learning tools.
2. Optimizing the scope by making changes in the partitions to increase the number of cells exposed in each iteration, introducing an adjustable parameter to improve accuracy and efficiency.
3. Investigating and developing new estimators using variance reduction strategies such as importance sampling, stratified sampling, or Quasi-Monte Carlo methods.

These strategies could potentially be applied during the data splitting process to improve the model's performance. For instance, when splitting the data, one could use stratified sampling to ensure that each subset (train, test, validation) contains a representative balance of the different classes or categories present in the data. This could help improve the model's ability to generalize and make more accurate predictions.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used for splitting data in deep learning model training, it does discuss several strategies that could be applied during the data splitting process to optimize the model's performance. These include using stratified sampling to ensure a representative balance of classes in each subset and applying machine learning tools and variance reduction strategies to improve the model's accuracy and efficiency.
