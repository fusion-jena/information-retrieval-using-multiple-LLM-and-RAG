Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the word embedding models are optimized. However, it is mentioned that the word2vec model used in the study was pre-trained by Baroni et al. (2014), which implies that the optimization of hyperparameters was done by the authors of the pre-trained model.

In general, there are various methods to optimize the hyperparameters of machine learning models, including grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves defining a range of possible values for each hyperparameter and training the model with all possible combinations of these values. Random search, on the other hand, involves randomly selecting values for each hyperparameter within a defined range. Bayesian optimization is a more sophisticated method that uses probabilistic modeling to select the most promising values for each hyperparameter.

In the case of word embedding models, some of the hyperparameters that may be optimized include the dimensionality of the vector space, the learning rate, the context window size, and the number of negative samples. The optimization of these hyperparameters can have a significant impact on the quality of the word embeddings and the performance of downstream natural language processing tasks.

The CBOW algorithm used to generate the word embeddings in the provided context may have its own set of hyperparameters that were optimized during training. However, the specific details of this optimization process are not provided in the context.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the word embedding models were optimized, there are various methods available for hyperparameter optimization, including grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. The optimization of hyperparameters can have a significant impact on the quality of the word embeddings and the performance of downstream natural language processing tasks.
