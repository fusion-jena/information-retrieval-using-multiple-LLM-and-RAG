Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of the LifeCLEF14 and LifeCLEF15 fish datasets, as well as the Brackish Dataset.

The LifeCLEF14 and LifeCLEF15 fish datasets were used by Salman et al., (2016) to compare the performance of a fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with traditional classification methods such as SVM, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Sparse Representation Classifier. The CNN outperformed the traditional methods with an average classification rate of more than 90%.

The Brackish Dataset was presented by Pedersen et al., (2019) as a publicly available underwater dataset containing bounding box annotated sequences of images captured in a brackish strait with varying visibility. The dataset contains big fish, small fish, starfish, shrimps, jellyfish, and crabs. Pedersen et al., (2019) fine-tuned and tested the YOLOv2 and YOLOv3 CNNs on the Brackish Dataset, but these systems support a detection process rather than a recognition or identification process required in their problem setting.

Therefore, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline in the provided context are the LifeCLEF14 and LifeCLEF15 fish datasets and the Brackish Dataset.
