Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, we can infer some steps from the context.

The text discusses the identification of ecological disturbance points, pinch points, and barriers in different scenarios (A, B, and C) using a resistance model. This model calculates the resistance value for each grid, which indicates the difficulty of moving through that grid. The resistance model has two threshold values: 62,000 and 93,000.

After calculating the resistance values, the model identifies the ecological disturbance points, pinch points, and barriers based on the resistance values and the search radius. The search radius is set differently for each scenario: 320 m for Scenario A, 200 m for Scenario B, and 500 m for Scenario C.

Therefore, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include:

1. Calculating the resistance values for each grid in the study area.
2. Identifying the ecological disturbance points, pinch points, and barriers based on the resistance values and the search radius.
3. Analyzing the distribution and characteristics of the identified ecological disturbance points, pinch points, and barriers in each scenario.

However, the context does not provide information about other postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix.
