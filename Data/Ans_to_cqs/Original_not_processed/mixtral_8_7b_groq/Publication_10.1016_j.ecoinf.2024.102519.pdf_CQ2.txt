Based on the information provided, the deep learning pipeline in the context of the study by Wu et al. uses primarily raster and vector data formats. 

Raster data is used for the majority of the data sources. This includes the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Land use, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil data, Population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and Meteorological data. Raster data is a grid of cells, where each cell contains a value representing information such as elevation, land use, or vegetation health. This format is particularly suitable for continuous variables and image-based data.

Vector data is used for the statistical data, which is likely to represent discrete features such as points, lines, or polygons. These could represent specific locations, roads, or administrative boundaries, among others.

The statistical yearbook is the only data source not explicitly associated with a data format. However, given that it is a statistical data source, it is likely to be in a format such as CSV, which is a common format for tabular data.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats in the provided context.
