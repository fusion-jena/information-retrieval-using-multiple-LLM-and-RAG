The provided context does not directly discuss data bias or data preprocessing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. However, it does mention the use of pretrained models and fine-tuning as a way to improve classification performance on specific datasets.

In the context of addressing data bias, pretrained models can be helpful because they have already been trained on large and diverse datasets, such as ImageNet. This can help ensure that the models have been exposed to a wide variety of data and are less likely to be biased towards certain characteristics of the training data.

Fine-tuning the pretrained models on the specific dataset of interest can further help to reduce data bias by allowing the models to adapt to the unique characteristics of the dataset. This can be especially important when the dataset is small or imbalanced, as fine-tuning can help the model to better learn from the available data.

The context also mentions the use of different CNN backbones, such as ResNet18, VGG16, DenseNet121, and AlexNet, to compare their performance on a specific task. This is a common approach in deep learning to identify the best model architecture for a given problem. However, it does not directly relate to addressing data bias.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss data bias or preprocessing techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling, it does mention the use of pretrained models and fine-tuning as a way to improve classification performance on specific datasets. These techniques can help to reduce data bias by exposing the models to a diverse range of data and allowing them to adapt to the unique characteristics of the dataset.
