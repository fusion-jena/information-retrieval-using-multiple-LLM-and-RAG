Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. The context focuses on machine learning techniques, specifically maximum likelihood parameter estimation, regularization, and ensemble methods like bagging and boosting. It also mentions the XGBoost algorithm, which is a gradient boosting implementation, but it does not discuss deep learning models or their hyperparameters.

Deep learning models have various hyperparameters that need to be tuned for optimal performance, such as learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, activation functions, and regularization techniques like L1 and L2 regularization. However, the provided context does not mention any of these hyperparameters.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query without additional information.
