Answer:::
The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a transformer-based model, specifically the BEiT (Bidirectional Encoder representations from Image Transformers) model. This model is a state-of-the-art image classification model that has shown significant performance improvements compared to conventional deep learning models. The BEiT model leverages the capabilities of transformer architecture in vision tasks, making it an effective choice for image classification. Furthermore, the model is combined with Xception, which enhances performance and efficiency through depthwise separable convolutions. This combination ensures that the model has complementary strengths for the purpose of leaf disease classification. Additionally, the LIME explainable technique is added to the model to enhance the interpretability of its decision-making process, promoting broader transparency and understanding.
