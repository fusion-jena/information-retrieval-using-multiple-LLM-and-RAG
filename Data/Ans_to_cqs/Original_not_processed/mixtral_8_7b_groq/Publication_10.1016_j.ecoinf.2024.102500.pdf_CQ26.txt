The provided context discusses various techniques used to address issues in machine learning and deep learning pipelines, such as overfitting and data bias. However, it does not explicitly mention the data bias mitigation techniques during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I will provide a general answer based on common practices in the field.

Answer:::

When dealing with data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed:

1. **Stratified splitting**: Stratified sampling ensures that the train and test datasets maintain the same proportion of classes as the original dataset. This method is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced classes.

2. **Oversampling**: Oversampling is a technique that increases the frequency of the minority class in the dataset, either by replicating instances or using synthetic data generation methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

3. **Undersampling**: Undersampling is a technique that reduces the frequency of the majority class in the dataset, either by randomly removing instances or using more sophisticated methods like NearMiss.

4. **Diverse data collection**: Collecting diverse data from various sources can help reduce data bias. This method ensures that the dataset represents the entire population better, reducing the risk of bias.

5. **Reweighing**: Reweighing techniques assign different weights to classes or samples to account for the bias during the training process.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, it does discuss other methods to improve model performance and address issues like overfitting. For instance, combining weak learners, such as ensemble RF-XGB and ANN models, can help reduce overfitting and improve prediction accuracy. Additionally, preprocessing techniques like ensemble bagging can enhance the performance of models like SVM in predicting water quality and stream flow.
