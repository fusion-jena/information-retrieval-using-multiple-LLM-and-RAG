The provided context does not give specific information about the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that machine learning techniques were used to classify fire-damaged monuments and identify minor fires, demonstrating notable success.

Typically, when evaluating the performance of a deep learning model, several metrics are used, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. It is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of a model, but it may not always be the best metric, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions. It measures the proportion of correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.

Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive samples. It measures the proportion of correctly identified positive samples out of all actual positive samples.

The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a balanced assessment of both metrics. It is a more reliable metric than accuracy, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

Therefore, based on common practices in evaluating deep learning models, it is likely that the model used in the study was evaluated using one or more of these metrics. However, without specific information from the context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
