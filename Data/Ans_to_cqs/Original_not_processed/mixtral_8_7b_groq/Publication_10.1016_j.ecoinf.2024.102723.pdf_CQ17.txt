Answer:::

The provided context discusses two regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models: Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) and L2 regularization.

Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) is a Bayesian deep learning technique that uses dropout regularization not only during training but also during prediction. By randomly dropping out neurons in the hidden layers, MCD introduces uncertainty in the model's predictions, leading to better generalization and preventing overfitting. MCD is implemented using the Bernoulli distribution, which corresponds to an approximate variational distribution, resulting in uncertainty estimates.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is another commonly used technique to prevent overfitting. It adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the model's weights. By penalizing large weights, L2 regularization encourages the model to distribute the importance of features more evenly, reducing the risk of overfitting.

The context also mentions the use of TensorFlow and Keras for building and training deep learning models. These frameworks provide built-in support for implementing regularization techniques, such as dropout and L2 regularization, making it easier for developers to incorporate them into their models.

In summary, Monte Carlo Dropout and L2 regularization are two regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Monte Carlo Dropout introduces uncertainty in the model's predictions by randomly dropping out neurons during training and prediction, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that encourages the model to distribute the importance of features more evenly. Both techniques are supported by popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras.
