Answer:::
The provided context does not contain information about the use of specific hardware resources for training a deep learning model. The text focuses on the application of machine learning algorithms, particularly random forest (RF) and maximum entropy (Maxent) models, to predict the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease (PWD) in South Korea based on environmental factors. It mentions the use of an R package for modeling but does not specify the hardware resources used for training.

The mentioned studies and articles focus on the development and comparison of machine learning algorithms for predicting PWD occurrence, evaluating the importance of different environmental factors, and analyzing the impact of climate change on PWD. There is no discussion of the hardware resources used for training the models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.
