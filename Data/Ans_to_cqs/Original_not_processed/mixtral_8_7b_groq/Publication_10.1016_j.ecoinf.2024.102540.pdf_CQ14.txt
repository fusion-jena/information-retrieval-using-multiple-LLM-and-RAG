Answer:::

The hyperparameters of the model were optimized by conducting initial computational experiments with different combinations of epochs and batch sizes. Specifically, the combinations of 300, 400, and 500 epochs with batch sizes of 8, 16, and 32 were tested. However, the context does not provide information on the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search. It is possible that a manual search or a simple trial-and-error approach was used to determine the optimal hyperparameters. Nonetheless, it was determined that the optimal hyperparameters for the training of the five detection models were 400 epochs with a batch size of 8, and these hyperparameters were constant when comparing the models using 640 × 640, and 1280 × 1280 pixels input resolutions.
