Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.

The first source, "Spatiotemporal variation in vegetation coverage and its driving factors in the Guanzhong Basin, NW China" by Zhao et al., 2021, focuses on the analysis of vegetation coverage and its driving factors in the Guanzhong Basin, China. It does not provide any details about model training or performance monitoring strategies.

The second source, "Performance evaluation of GIMMS NDVI based on MODIS NDVI and SPOT NDVI data" by Zhu et al., 2019, evaluates the performance of the GIMMS NDVI using MODIS NDVI and SPOT NDVI data. The study compares the NDVI data from different sources to assess the performance of GIMMS NDVI. However, it does not discuss the monitoring of model performance during training.

The third source consists of tables showing changes in forest area, grassland area, cropland area, and orchard area over different periods. There is no information about model training or performance monitoring strategies in these tables.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
