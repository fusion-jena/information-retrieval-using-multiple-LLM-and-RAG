Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information on the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for mangrove forest individual tree crown delineation. The study by Lassalle et al., 2022, focuses on the application and results of the deep learning model, but it does not mention the specific hyperparameters used.

The context includes information on various studies related to mangrove forests, such as their distribution, changes, and influencing factors. However, these studies do not involve the use of deep learning models or the specification of hyperparameters.

In summary, while the provided context contains valuable information about mangrove forests and related studies, it does not include the details of the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for mangrove forest individual tree crown delineation.
