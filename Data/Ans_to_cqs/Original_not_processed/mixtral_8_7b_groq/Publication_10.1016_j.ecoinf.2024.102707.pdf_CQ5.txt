The provided context does not give information about using widely known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, it describes the use of specific datasets related to ecological informatics and remote sensing.

In the study by Cusick et al. (Ecological Informatics 82(2024)1027073), the authors used their own training data for training YOLOv6, a convolutional neural network for object detection. However, the context does not provide details about the dataset, such as its name or the type of images it contains.

Additionally, the study by Stammerjohn and Barrington (Remote Sens. Ecology Conserv. 6 (1), 70–78) used data collected by citizen scientists to learn about the habitat affinity of the Weddell seal in Antarctica. Le et al. (Remote Sens. Ecology Conserv. 8 (2), 251–262) developed a convolutional neural network architecture for the automated survey of seabird colonies, but the context does not specify the dataset used for training.

Liu et al. (Towards efficient machine learning methods for penguin counting) used a dataset of penguin images for counting penguins using machine learning methods. However, the context does not provide information on the name or source of the dataset.

Finally, Shuford and Spear (Surveys of Breeding Penguins and Other Seabirds in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica, January–February 1987) conducted surveys of breeding penguins and other seabirds in Antarctica, but it is unclear whether this data was used in a deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the provided context does not mention any of the commonly used datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it refers to specific datasets used in ecological informatics and remote sensing studies, but the context does not provide sufficient details about these datasets.
