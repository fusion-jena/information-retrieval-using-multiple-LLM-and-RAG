The provided text discusses the use of deep learning models for species classification, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and their performance in terms of F1-scores. However, it does not directly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

That being said, some of the mentioned techniques such as oversampling and diverse data collection can be used to address data bias.

Oversampling is a technique where the minority class in the dataset is increased by replicating samples from that class. This can help to ensure that the model is trained on a more balanced dataset, reducing the risk of bias towards the majority class.

Diverse data collection refers to the process of gathering data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help to reduce bias by ensuring that the model is exposed to a wide range of variations in the data.

Stratified splitting and undersampling are other techniques that can be used to address data bias. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets while preserving the percentage of samples for each class, ensuring that each subset is representative of the population. Undersampling, on the other hand, involves reducing the number of samples in the majority class to balance the dataset.

In summary, while the provided text does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, techniques such as oversampling, diverse data collection, stratified splitting, and undersampling can be used to address data bias.
