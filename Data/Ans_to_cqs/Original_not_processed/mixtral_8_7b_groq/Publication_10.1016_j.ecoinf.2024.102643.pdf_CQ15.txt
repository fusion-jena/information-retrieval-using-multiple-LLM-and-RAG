The provided context does not include information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on predicting range shifts of African apes under global change scenarios and the frequency of conflict types in different regions. It mentions various statistical models and methods such as Maximum Entropy, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline, Generalized Boosted Model, Classification Tree Analyses, Flexible Discriminant Analysis, Surface Response Envelope, Chi-square tests, and frequency of occurrence. However, it does not mention any optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or others.

Answer:::
