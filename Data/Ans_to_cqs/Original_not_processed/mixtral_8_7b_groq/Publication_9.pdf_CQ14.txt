Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text describes the process of creating a fish segmentation model using manual annotation, transfer learning, and a ResNet-101 convolutional neural network (CNN) with COCO pre-trained weights. However, it does not mention any specific techniques for hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization.

Hyperparameter tuning is an essential step in training machine learning models to ensure good performance and prevent overfitting. Grid search and random search are two common methods for hyperparameter optimization. Grid search involves systematically trying all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a specified range, while random search selects hyperparameters at random from specified distributions.

Therefore, it is possible that the authors used one of these methods or another technique for hyperparameter tuning, but it is not specified in the provided context. It is also possible that they used default hyperparameters for the ResNet-101 model and COCO pre-trained weights.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information on how the hyperparameters of the fish segmentation model are optimized. Hyperparameter tuning is an important step in training machine learning models, and it is possible that the authors used grid search, random search, or another technique for this purpose. However, this information is not provided in the given text.
