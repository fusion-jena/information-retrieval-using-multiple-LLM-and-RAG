Based on the information provided, the deep learning pipeline in this particular study utilizes remote sensing data, which primarily consists of image data. Here are the specific data formats used:

1. GF-1 optical imagery: These are multispectral images captured with a wide-format WFV camera. The GF-1 multispectral images have four bands of blue, green, red, and near-infrared with a spatial resolution of 16 m.

2. GF-3 SAR imagery: Although not explicitly mentioned in the context, GF-3 SAR imagery is another type of remote sensing data used in the study. SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) imagery uses radar to image the Earth's surface and can provide images regardless of cloud cover or time of day.

3. MODIS NDVI imagery: The MODIS NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) images are derived from the MOD09Q1 dataset with a resolution of 250 m and an interval of 8 days. NDVI is a common vegetation index used in remote sensing to monitor vegetation health.

It's important to note that while the study primarily uses image data, the specific formats (GF-1, GF-3, and MODIS NDVI) are not typical formats used in general deep learning pipelines. However, these formats can be converted into more common formats (such as TIFF or JPEG for images) for use in deep learning frameworks.

Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline in this study uses remote sensing data in the form of GF-1 optical imagery, GF-3 SAR imagery, and MODIS NDVI imagery. These can be considered as image data formats, although they are not commonly used formats in general deep learning pipelines.
