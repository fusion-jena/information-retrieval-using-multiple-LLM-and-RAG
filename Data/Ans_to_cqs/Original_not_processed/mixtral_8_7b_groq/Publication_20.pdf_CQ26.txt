The provided context does not give specific details about the data preprocessing steps taken to address data bias in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the training dataset T4 was created by splitting thumbnails from each species into 20 classes of "part of species," resulting in a more diverse dataset. This could potentially help reduce bias by ensuring that the model is trained on a variety of different parts of each fish species, rather than just a single "part of fish" class.

In addition, the context states that at least 2200 thumbnails were used per fish species class during training. This suggests that oversampling may have been used to increase the number of examples for species with fewer initial thumbnails, which could also help reduce bias.

Furthermore, the use of baited video stations for data collection, as mentioned in Langlois et al. (2010), could potentially contribute to a more diverse dataset by capturing a wider range of fish behaviors and interactions with their environment.

Overall, while the context does not provide explicit details about bias-addressing techniques used during preprocessing, it suggests that some efforts were made to increase diversity and potentially oversample certain classes in the training dataset.
