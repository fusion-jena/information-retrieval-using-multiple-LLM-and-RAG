Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text describes a study that proposes a deep learning-based pipeline for whitefly pest abundance estimation on chromotropic sticky traps, but it does not mention where the code for this pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
