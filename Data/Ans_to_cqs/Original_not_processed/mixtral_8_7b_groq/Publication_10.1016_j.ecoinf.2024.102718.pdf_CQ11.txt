Answer:::

I am unable to provide a direct link to the data repository used in the deep learning pipeline as it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, the text mentions the use of two public datasets: the PlantVillage dataset and the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset.

The PlantVillage dataset is used to pre-train the network's weights. It is a popular dataset for plant disease recognition tasks and can be accessed at the following link: <https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tywbtsjrjv/1>.

The Dhan-Shomadhan dataset is used to train the final model for diagnosing rice leaf diseases in the field. The context does not provide enough information to directly access this dataset. However, since it is a public dataset, it might be available in repositories like Figshare, Zenodo, or DataDryad. You can search for it using the name "Dhan-Shomadhan dataset" or "Hossain, 2023" in these repositories.

In summary, while I cannot provide a direct link to the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset, you can find the PlantVillage dataset at <https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tywbtsjrjv/1>. You can search for the Dhan-Shomadhan dataset in data repositories using the name or the reference provided.
