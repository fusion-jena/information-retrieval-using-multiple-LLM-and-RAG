The provided context does not contain information about the preprocessing techniques used in the deep learning pipeline to address data bias. The text mainly focuses on the evaluation of the performance of individual methods and the comparison of lasso and no bias correction techniques in the context of ecological informatics.

However, based on general knowledge of data preprocessing techniques for addressing data bias, some commonly used methods include:

1. Stratified sampling: This technique involves dividing the data into strata based on certain characteristics, such as class labels, and then randomly sampling from each stratum to ensure that the training and testing sets have a similar distribution of these characteristics.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class in the training set to balance the class distribution.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class in the training set to balance the class distribution.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population of interest.

These techniques can help to address data bias and improve the performance of machine learning models. However, the specific technique(s) used will depend on the characteristics of the data and the problem at hand. It is important to carefully consider the preprocessing techniques used and evaluate their impact on model performance.

Therefore, based on the provided context and general knowledge, the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
