Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. None of the sources mention where the data used in the studies is stored or shared, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The sources mainly focus on describing the methods and models used in the studies, as well as discussing the results and implications of those studies. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
