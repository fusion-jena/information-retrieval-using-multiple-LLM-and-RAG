Answer:::
In the context provided, there is a specific example of a process for training a deep learning model, namely YWnet for underwater target detection. However, it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. 

However, in the context of deep learning, normalization is a common preprocessing step to ensure that the data is on a similar scale, which can help the model converge during training. This can be done in various ways, such as min-max scaling, z-score normalization, or batch normalization. 

Cleaning typically refers to handling missing or corrupted data points. In the context of image data, this could involve removing or interpolating damaged parts of the image. 

In the provided context, the preprocessing steps for the underwater target detection task include selecting appropriate water downloading gear and sensors for data collection, pre-processing of the acquired data (such as denoising, image enhancement, and correction), and labeling the dataset for training and evaluation. 

So, while the specific preprocessing steps of normalization, scaling, and cleaning are not mentioned in the provided context, they are common practices in deep learning and were likely performed in the unspecified "pre-processing of the acquired data" step.
