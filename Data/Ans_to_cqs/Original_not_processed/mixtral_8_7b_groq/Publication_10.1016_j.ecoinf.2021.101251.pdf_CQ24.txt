The provided context does not contain information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of random seed values. The context focuses on data citations, specifically dynamic data citations, and their use in data repositories and aggregators.

Dynamic data citations are useful for query-based data downloads within a single repository or data aggregator, allowing the user to specify subsets of data and reference a single citation for the custom query and download. This approach is particularly useful when data is standardized and can be readily integrated across datasets from a search query.

The RDA Dynamic Data Citation Working Group recommends using a 'Dynamic Data Citation' for repositories that enable a search and custom download of data, assigning a unique identifier and a landing page with the query and timestamp that resolves to a list of the data packages.

Currently, dynamic data citations are generally constrained to repository query capabilities and assume that the data can be resolved through a single or small number of queries. An alternate approach would be to have a tool that allows the data consumer to specify the dynamic data citations used in their paper and create a custom, synthesized data citation, which would be of high value to the data consumer.

In summary, while the context provides valuable information about data citations, it does not contain information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
