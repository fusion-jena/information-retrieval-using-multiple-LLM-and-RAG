Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This information can be inferred from the context provided in section III, which mentions that CNN approaches are used for the study. However, the specific architecture or details of the CNN model are not provided in the context.

The study emphasizes the challenges faced in obtaining a large corpus of high-quality annotated data for training CNN models to classify within-species animal types. This indicates that the focus is on using CNNs for fine-grained classification tasks in the field of animal conservation.

Additionally, the context explains the data pre-processing stages, which include segmenting audio files into 15-second windows and extracting features using Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). These pre-processing techniques are commonly used in conjunction with CNN models for audio classification tasks.

In summary, based on the provided context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is used for fine-grained classification of animal species in the field of conservation.
