Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically a GoogLeNet architecture. This information is derived from the context provided, which states that the model is composed of 22 layers and uses inception modules to perform convolutions of different sizes on pixels. CNNs are commonly used for image classification tasks due to their ability to effectively analyze spatial data, which aligns with the goal of classifying whole fish, parts of fish species, and environmental images.
