The provided context discusses various models used in the field of deep learning, such as CNN, Transformer, and MLP models, but it does not explicitly mention the methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of pre-trained models and public datasets.

Answer:::
While the text does not directly answer the query, it is possible to infer that deep learning pipelines may utilize methods such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets to collect raw data. The use of pre-trained models and public datasets, such as the IP102 dataset mentioned in the context, suggests that these datasets are publicly available and likely collected through various means, such as sensors or surveys.

Answer:::
Moreover, the context also mentions the use of data augmentation techniques, which involve creating new data based on modifications to existing data. This further supports the idea that deep learning pipelines may utilize a variety of methods to collect and generate raw data.

Answer:::
In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly answer the query, it suggests that deep learning pipelines may utilize methods such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets to collect raw data. Additionally, the use of pre-trained models, public datasets, and data augmentation techniques provides further evidence of the various ways that raw data may be collected and generated in deep learning pipelines.
