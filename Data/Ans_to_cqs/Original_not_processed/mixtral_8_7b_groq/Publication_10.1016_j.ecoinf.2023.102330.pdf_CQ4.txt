Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the data augmentation technique used in the deep learning pipeline involves adding a number of known 'non-detections' with a distance of NA to the dataset of detected or simulated calls. This increases the total number of observations M to 300 per ARU. However, the context does not specify any particular techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling that are commonly used in image data augmentation.

Instead, the data augmentation technique used here involves the creation of a data augmentation variable zi,j for each observation to indicate whether it was a true call or not. The total realized number of calls including false positive CNN detections (NFPi = j=1zi,j) can be modeled in relation to the data augmentation parameter Ïˆ, pi,j and the binary detection outcomes of each call using equations 10-12.

Therefore, the data augmentation technique used here is not a traditional image data augmentation technique, but rather a method for incorporating known non-detections and false positives into the model.
