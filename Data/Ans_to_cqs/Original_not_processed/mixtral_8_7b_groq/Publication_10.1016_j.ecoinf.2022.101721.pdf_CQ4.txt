I don't have access to the specific deep learning pipeline you're referring to, so I can't say for certain which data augmentation techniques were applied. However, I can provide some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning.

Data augmentation is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the diversity of data available for training models, without actually collecting new data. This is particularly useful in the field of computer vision, where images can be transformed in various ways to create new training examples.

Common data augmentation techniques for images include:

1. Flipping: This involves creating a mirrored image by flipping the original image either horizontally or vertically. This can help the model generalize better to new images that might be rotated or oriented differently.

2. Rotation: This involves rotating the original image by a certain angle. This can help the model learn to recognize objects regardless of their orientation.

3. Scaling: This involves changing the size of the original image, either by zooming in (cropping) or zooming out (padding). This can help the model learn to recognize objects at different scales.

4. Translation: This involves shifting the original image either horizontally or vertically. This can help the model learn to recognize objects that might be located in different positions within an image.

5. Color jittering: This involves randomly changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue of the original image. This can help the model learn to recognize objects under different lighting conditions.

6. Elastic deformation: This involves applying a random warping to the original image, which can help the model learn to recognize objects that might be deformed in real-world scenarios.

Without more information about the specific deep learning pipeline you're referring to, I can't say for sure which of these techniques were used. However, these are some common data augmentation techniques that are often applied in deep learning pipelines for computer vision tasks.
