Answer: The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and the F1 score. Accuracy is the ratio of the correctly predicted observations to the total observations. Precision, also known as positive predictive value, is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives. It measures the correctness of the model when it predicts the positive class. Recall, also known as sensitivity, is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives. It measures the completeness of the model when it predicts the positive class. Specificity is the ratio of true negatives to the sum of true negatives and false positives. It measures the correctness of the model when it predicts the negative class. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a measure of the balance between the two metrics. These metrics are essential for evaluating the performance of the model, especially for large-scale deployments, where cost and energy consumption are critical factors.
