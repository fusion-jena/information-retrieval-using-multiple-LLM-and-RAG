Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning model in the given context is image classification. The deep learning models, namely AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50, are used to classify individual tree patches into 18 different tree species. This is a supervised image classification problem where the models are trained on a dataset of tree patches, each belonging to one of the 18 tree species. The classification accuracies of these models are reported in Table 2, which includes Unweighted Average Accuracy (UA), Precision (PA), and F1-Score for each class and overall. The flowchart of the tree species classification approach is presented in Figure 2, which consists of three main steps: image preprocessing, feature extraction using deep learning models, and post-processing for final classification. Therefore, the deep learning models are used for the specific purpose of image classification in this tree species identification task.
