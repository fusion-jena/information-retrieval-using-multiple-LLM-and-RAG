Answer:::

The data splitting criteria used for the deep learning model training involve splitting the complete sample set into 70% and 30% for training and validation, respectively. This splitting approach is consistently applied throughout the hierarchical process. Additionally, a sliding window approach is employed to generate results.

Before applying data augmentation techniques, any samples containing no-data values are excluded. Six data augmentation techniques are then applied to the remaining training and validation samples. The dataset is randomly split, with 70% assigned for training and 30% for validation.

This specific data splitting method is described in the context related to the hierarchical mapping of Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado) physiognomies based on deep learning. However, the context does not provide information on whether this data splitting approach is universally applied or if it is specific to this study.

In summary, the data is split into training and validation sets, comprising 70% and 30% of the complete sample set, respectively. Data augmentation techniques are applied to the remaining samples after excluding those with no-data values. The sliding window approach is used to generate results. This data splitting method is consistent throughout the hierarchical process in the context provided.
