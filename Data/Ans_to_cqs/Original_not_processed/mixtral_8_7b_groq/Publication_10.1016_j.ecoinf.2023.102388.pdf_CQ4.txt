Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the described deep learning pipelines. However, the context does discuss measures taken to prevent overfitting, like using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.0001 and a weight decay of 0.5, as well as applying batch-norm, dropout (0.5), and adjusting the batch size and number of training epochs.

In the 'no-overfitting' setting, the use of weight decay and dropout can be seen as a form of regularization, helping to reduce overfitting by preventing the model's weights from becoming too large or adapted to specific training examples. Batch normalization, on the other hand, helps to stabilize and speed up training by normalizing the inputs to each layer, reducing internal covariate shift.

In the 'overfitting' setting, the removal of batch-norm, weight decay, and dropout techniques ensures that the model overfits. This allows for the exploration of the model's capacity to memorize training data without the constraints imposed by regularization techniques.

The Label-only attack method focuses on using only the predicted labels from the target model to determine membership status. This method does not involve data augmentation but instead relies on adversarial perturbations to modify input samples until a change in the predicted label occurs.

The VGG16 architecture description does not mention data augmentation techniques either. However, it does discuss fine-tuning the VGG16 model during the SNN training process by unfreezing the last two blocks and adjusting the final dense layer for each dataset.

In conclusion, while data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Instead, the context focuses on other methods to prevent overfitting and ensure model generalization.
