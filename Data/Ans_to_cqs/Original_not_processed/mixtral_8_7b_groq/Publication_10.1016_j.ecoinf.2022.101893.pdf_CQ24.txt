Answer:::

While the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of a dropout layer in a deep learning model for bird recognition. A dropout layer is a regularization technique used in deep learning to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of the input units to zero during training, which helps to introduce randomness and improve the generalization ability of the model.

In addition, the concept of feature selection using the mRMR (minimum redundancy maximum relevance) method is also discussed in the context. This method calculates the relevance between the feature and the category based on mutual information, which involves the use of probability distributions and can be affected by randomness in the data.

Furthermore, the use of data enhancement technology in bird recognition can also be seen as a way to handle randomness. By augmenting the data with various transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping, the model is exposed to a more diverse set of inputs, which can help to improve its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of techniques such as dropout layers, feature selection based on mutual information, and data enhancement that can help to introduce randomness and improve the generalization ability of deep learning models.
