Answer: The data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context is images. More specifically, the input data consists of images of chironomid head capsules, which are used for taxonomic classification. These images have a size of 512x512 pixels with 3 color channels. The images are processed by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in Python using the Keras library and TensorFlow as the back-end engine. The CNN model transforms the input images into a 2048-dimensional feature vector, which is then subjected to classification using a fully connected layer. The network's output is a probability distribution over the different taxonomic classes, obtained using a normalized exponential function (softmax). Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in this case works exclusively with image data.
