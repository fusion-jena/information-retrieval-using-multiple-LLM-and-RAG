The provided texts do not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, they do mention the use of specific operations and modules in the context of deep learning model training.

In the first text, the authors describe a module that involves the use of an attention mechanism during the concatenation operation. Network training yields three weight values, each corresponding to one of the feature maps. These weights are subsequently applied to the respective feature maps, with a greater influence on the model associated with a higher weight and a lesser influence receiving a lower weight. This suggests that the training process includes some form of randomness, as the weights are determined through a learning algorithm. However, the text does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value to control this randomness.

The second text describes the use of a module called SPPF, which involves a standard Conv operation followed by Max pooling with kernel sizes of 5, 9, and 13. The results are concatenated with the Conv module for extracting shallow semantic features, which are subsequently passed through a final Conv module. This process also likely involves some form of randomness, as the Conv and Max pooling operations include parameters that are learned during training. Again, however, the text does not mention the use of a random seed value to control this randomness.

In summary, while the provided texts mention the use of operations and modules that likely involve some form of randomness during training, they do not explicitly discuss strategies for handling this randomness, such as the use of a random seed value. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based on the provided context.
