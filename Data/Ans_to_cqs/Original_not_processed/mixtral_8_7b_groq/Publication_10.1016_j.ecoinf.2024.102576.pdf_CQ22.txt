Answer: The provided context discusses the use of a deep learning model for land monitoring and ecological information extraction, but it does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the model. However, it does imply that the model's performance is assessed in terms of its classification accuracy.

In the context, it is mentioned that the research conducted by Kim et al. (2021a) improved classification accuracy as data increased during the training of a deep learning model using satellite imageries over multiple periods (Kim et al., 2021b). This suggests that accuracy is one of the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.

Additionally, in the context, it is mentioned that the U-Net model, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN), is a deep learning algorithm that performs classification through supervised learning (Ulmas and Liiv, 2020; Kattenborn et al., 2021). In supervised learning, models are typically evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, among others.

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. Precision is the ratio of true positives (correctly predicted positive instances) to the sum of true positives and false positives (incorrectly predicted positive instances). Recall is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives (missed positive instances). The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model's performance, it can be inferred that accuracy is one of the metrics used, and other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score are likely used as well.
