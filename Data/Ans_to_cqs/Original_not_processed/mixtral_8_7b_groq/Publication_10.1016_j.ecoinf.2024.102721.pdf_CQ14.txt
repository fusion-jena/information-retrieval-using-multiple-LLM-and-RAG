The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using Bayesian optimization (BO) in the given context. BO is a global optimization algorithm that is used to optimize the hyperparameters in machine learning models to achieve high simulation accuracy. Unlike grid search and random search, which are traditional methods for hyperparameter tuning, BO is based on the Bayesian theorem to estimate the posterior distribution of target functions.

BO establishes a provisional surrogate function based on past evaluations of unknown target functions and continues to search for the next set of hyperparameters that minimize the surrogate function. Through iterative computation of BO and a constant correction of the prior probabilities, the agent model will closely approximate location objective functions.

In this study, Gaussian processes are selected as the probabilistic agent model, which is widely employed in non-linear regression, classification, and other fields. The Gaussian distribution is expressed as f(x) ∼ GP(μ(x), k(x, x)), where μ(x) is the mathematical expectation of f(x), usually the mean function is set to 0, f(x) is the mean absolute error, and k(x, x) is the covariance function of x.

The use of BO for hyperparameter tuning is particularly useful in the context of eco-hydrological studies, where building effective models is a complex and time-consuming process that involves tuning a large number of hyperparameters to obtain an optimal model architecture. The non-linear interaction between hyperparameters makes manual tuning ineffective for most issues. By using BO, the hyperparameters of the model can be optimized to improve the performance of the model on unseen data, thereby increasing the generalization ability and robustness of the model.
