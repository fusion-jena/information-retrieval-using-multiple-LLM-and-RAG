Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of pre-trained models for extracting embeddings in the field of bioacoustics, specifically for gibbon vocalization analysis. However, it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. 

Generally, before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are involved, including but not limited to:

1. Normalization: This process involves scaling the data to a range that is suitable for the model. Common normalization techniques include min-max scaling, where data is scaled between 0 and 1, or z-score normalization, where data is scaled to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling involves adjusting the range of the data. However, scaling does not necessarily require the data to be centered around a mean of 0.

3. Cleaning: This step involves removing any noise or outliers from the data that may interfere with the model's learning. This may include removing silent sections from audio data or removing outlier data points from a dataset.

4. Feature extraction: In the context of audio data, this step involves converting the raw audio data into a format that can be used by a deep learning model. This may include extracting features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), chroma features, or spectral contrast.

5. Data augmentation: This step involves artificially increasing the size of the dataset by applying transformations to the existing data. This may include adding noise to audio data or applying time stretching or pitch shifting to create new data points.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these preprocessing steps, it does imply that data cleaning and feature extraction were performed as part of the process of extracting embeddings from the BirdNET model. However, the specific details of these steps are not provided.
