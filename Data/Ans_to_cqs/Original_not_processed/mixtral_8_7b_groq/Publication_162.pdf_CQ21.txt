Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention that the system uses active learning, where images are forwarded to humans for annotation and then used to train a classifier iteratively. It can be inferred that metrics calculation is involved in the evaluation of the model's performance, as there is a mention of a retained test set of images annotated manually.

In addition, the system breaks down the image into dark areas that are approximately the area of the moths to be classified, and records are sorted out that do not contain animal images due to false alarms from the motion detector. This suggests that some form of image processing or feature extraction is performed on the images before they are used for training or evaluation.

However, there is no mention of more specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a comprehensive answer to the query based on the provided context.
