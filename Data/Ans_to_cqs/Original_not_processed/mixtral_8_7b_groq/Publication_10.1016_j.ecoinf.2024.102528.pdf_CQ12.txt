Answer:::

The specific type of deep learning model used in the mentioned studies is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the affiliations of the authors and the topics of the papers, it can be inferred that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are likely used.

In the paper "Deep residual learning for image recognition" by He et al., 2016, the authors introduce a residual learning framework for image recognition, which is based on CNNs. This framework has been widely used in computer vision tasks and could potentially be used in the studies related to avian diversity monitoring and bird migration.

In the paper "BirdNET: a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring" by Kahl et al., 2021, the authors developed BirdNET, a deep learning model for bird species identification. Although the specific architecture of the model is not provided, it is mentioned that the model is based on a deep neural network, which typically refers to a CNN.

In the paper "Parsing birdsong with deep audio embeddings" by Tolkova et al., 2021, the authors use a deep learning model to parse birdsong. While the specific architecture of the model is not provided, it is mentioned that the model is based on a deep neural network, which again typically refers to a CNN.

Therefore, while the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly stated, it is likely that CNNs are used in the studies related to avian diversity monitoring and bird migration.
