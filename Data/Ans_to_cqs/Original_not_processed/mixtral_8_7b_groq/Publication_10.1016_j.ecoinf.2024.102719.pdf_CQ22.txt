The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models for river quality assessment, but it does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the importance of evaluating the generalizability of machine learning (ML) models, including deep learning models, to unseen datasets.

In the context, it is mentioned that bias-variance decomposition is widely adopted for generalizability evaluations of ML models. Bias-variance decomposition is a technique used to analyze the performance of a predictive model by decomposing the error into bias, variance, and irreducible error. Bias refers to the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem, which may be extremely complicated, with a simplified model. Variance refers to the error introduced by the model's sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set. Irreducible error is the error that cannot be eliminated by improving the model or increasing the amount of data.

In addition, the context mentions the use of heterogeneous ensemble methods for predicting student academic performance. Heterogeneous ensemble methods combine the predictions of multiple base models, which can be different types of models, to improve the performance and generalizability of the final model. In the context of river quality assessment, a heterogeneous ensemble of deep learning models and other ML models could be used to improve the generalizability of the predictions.

The context also provides several references to papers that discuss uncertainty quantification, model evaluation, and ensemble methods in the context of ML and deep learning. These papers may provide more information on the metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models for river quality assessment, it does emphasize the importance of evaluating the generalizability of ML models, including deep learning models, and provides references to papers that may provide more information on model evaluation.
