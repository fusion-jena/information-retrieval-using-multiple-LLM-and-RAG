Answer:::

 Based on the provided context, there is no direct information given about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context mainly discusses the research paper "Background sampling for multi-scale ensemble habitat selection modeling: Does the number of points matter?" published in the Ecological Informatics journal. It talks about the importance of carefully considering the data used to train component models in habitat selection modeling. However, it does not mention or provide a link to any data repository related to a deep learning pipeline.

 The keywords in the abstract suggest that the study might involve species distribution models, presence-absence and presence-only data, and the Biomod modeling framework. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to accurately determine the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in this study.

 If you are interested in the data used in this study, you may consider contacting the authors through the corresponding author's email provided in the paper. They might be able to provide more information about the data and the deep learning pipeline used in their research.
