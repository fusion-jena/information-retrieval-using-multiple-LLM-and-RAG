Answer:::

The text provided does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models for evaluation. However, it does discuss the evaluation of artificial neural network (ANN) models, which are a type of deep learning model.

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the ANN models in the text include Adjusted R2 (Adjusted coefficient of determination), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).

Adjusted R2 is a measure of the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. It is a modified version of the R-squared statistic that has been adjusted for the number of predictor variables in the model. A higher Adjusted R2 value indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

Mean Squared Error (MSE) is a measure of the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable. A lower MSE value indicates a better fit of the model to the data.

Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) are both measures of the relative quality of a statistical model, for a given set of data. They both take into account the complexity of the model and the goodness of fit of the model to the data. Lower AIC and BIC values indicate a better-fitting model.

It is worth noting that the text does not mention the use of accuracy, precision, or recall as metrics for evaluating the performance of the ANN models. These metrics are commonly used in the evaluation of classification models, but they may not be as relevant for regression models such as the ANN models discussed in the text.
