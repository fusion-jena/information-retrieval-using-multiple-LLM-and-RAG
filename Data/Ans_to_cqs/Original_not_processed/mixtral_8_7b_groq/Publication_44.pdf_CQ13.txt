Answer:::
The provided context discusses some details about the training process and the architecture of the deep learning model, but it does not give specific information about the learning rate or the optimizer used.

The context mentions that during training, the model went through 3000 iterations, and the best performing model based on the validation loss was saved. It also mentions that a Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) threshold of 0.7 was used during testing.

The model's architecture includes a Faster R-CNN model, which is a region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) for object detection. The model also includes a feature extractor based on ResNet-101 or Xception, and a module called Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) for multi-scale processing. Additionally, DeepLabv3+ includes an effective decoder module for improving the boundaries of the segmentation results.

However, the context does not provide enough information to determine the learning rate or the optimizer used during training. The learning rate is a hyperparameter that determines the size of the steps that the model takes during training, while the optimizer is an algorithm that updates the model's weights based on the gradient of the loss function.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
