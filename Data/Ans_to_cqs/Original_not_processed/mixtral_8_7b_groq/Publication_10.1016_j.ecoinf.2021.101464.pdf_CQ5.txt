Based on the provided context, a deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned as being used in this research. The research primarily focuses on using a random forest model for analyzing the influence of forest microclimate on NAI (Net Assimilation Index) using various sensor data.

The datasets used in this research include measurements from temperature and humidity sensors (HMP155, Vaisala. Inc., Finland), wind speed sensors (WindSonic anemometer, Gill. Inc., UK), atmospheric pressure sensors (AV-410BP, Avalon Inc., USA), photosynthetically active radiation sensors (LI-190SB, Licor Inc., USA), direct radiation sensors (LI-200Ã—, Licor Inc., USA), ultraviolet radiation sensors (CUV5, Kipp zonen Inc., Netherlands), net radiation sensors (CNR4, Kipp zonen Inc., Netherlands), and particulate matter 2.5 sensors (RR-9421, Rainroot Inc., China).

However, the context does mention the use of big data theory and technology, neural networks, and structural equations, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. But, the specific datasets used for these techniques are not provided in the context.

Therefore, we cannot determine the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for this research.
