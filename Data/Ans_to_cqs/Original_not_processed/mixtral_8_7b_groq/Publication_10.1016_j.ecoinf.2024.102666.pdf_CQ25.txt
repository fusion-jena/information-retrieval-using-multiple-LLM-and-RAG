Answer:::

The provided context does not contain specific information about the purpose of a deep learning model in the context of remote sensing or artificial neural networks (ANN). However, it does mention the use of artificial neural networks for atmospheric correction (AC) in aquatic environments. The purpose of AC is to minimize the effects of the atmosphere on the radiance measurements made by satellite sensors, allowing for more accurate analysis of the underlying surface.

In addition, the context also mentions a comparative evaluation of deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) and deep neural network (DNN) for land use/land cover classifications of mining regions using fused multi-sensor satellite data. In this case, the purpose of the deep learning models is likely to be classification, as they are being used to categorize different land use/land cover types in mining regions.

It's worth noting that deep learning models have a wide range of applications in remote sensing, including but not limited to image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and image generation. The specific purpose of a deep learning model would depend on the task and data at hand.
