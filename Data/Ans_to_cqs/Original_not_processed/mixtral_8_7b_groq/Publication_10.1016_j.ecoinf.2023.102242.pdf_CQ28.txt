The text provided does not give information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the processing of remote sensing data, including radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, orthophoto correction, image registration, image fusion, and mosaic cropping. It also mentions the use of feature optimization tools and multi-scale segmentation before classification. However, it does not specify the platform used for deploying the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
