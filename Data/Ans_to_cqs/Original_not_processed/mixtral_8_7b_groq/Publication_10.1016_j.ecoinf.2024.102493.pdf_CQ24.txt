Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about strategies employed to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general strategies that are commonly used to manage randomness in machine learning and data analysis.

Answer:::
In machine learning and data analysis, randomness can be introduced through various processes, such as data sampling, feature selection, and weight initialization in deep learning models. To handle randomness, several strategies can be employed:

1. **Fixed Seeds**: To ensure reproducibility, a fixed seed value can be set for random number generators. This ensures that the same sequence of random numbers is generated each time the code is run, making the results consistent and reproducible.

2. **Cross-Validation**: Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance and generalizability of machine learning models. By dividing the data into multiple folds and training and testing the model on different subsets, cross-validation helps reduce the impact of randomness and provides a more robust estimate of model performance.

3. **Ensemble Methods**: Ensemble methods, such as bagging and boosting, can help reduce the impact of randomness by combining the predictions of multiple models trained on different subsets of the data. This can lead to more stable and accurate predictions.

4. **Regularization**: Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, can help reduce overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. This can help ensure that the model does not rely too heavily on specific features or random fluctuations in the data.

5. **Stratified Sampling**: When sampling data, stratified sampling can be used to ensure that each subset of the data contains a representative sample of the overall population. This can help reduce the impact of randomness and ensure that the model is trained on a diverse and representative sample of the data.

While these strategies are not specific to the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context, they are commonly used to handle randomness in machine learning and data analysis.
