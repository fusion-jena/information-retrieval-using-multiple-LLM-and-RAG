Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix. However, the context does provide information about data collection and survey methods that could be part of the model training process.

The document describes a field study consisting of four sessions over a 12-month period, covering four seasonal types. The researchers used line-transect surveys with both observer and drone methods. Surveys were conducted either in the morning (6 am to 9 am) or afternoon (4 pm to 7 pm) to reduce the risk of disturbance and minimize the impact of human activity.

Additionally, the study used point-count and survey type methods in different habitats: native vegetation, new streetscape, and parkland. Observers were involved in the survey method for these habitats.

The data collected could be used for model training, and postprocessing steps might include:

1. Saliency maps: These visualizations help to understand which features in the input data the model focuses on to make predictions. In the context of this study, saliency maps could highlight the importance of specific habitat types, seasonal factors, or survey methods in predicting the presence of certain species.
2. Metrics calculation: After training a model, it is essential to evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics. These metrics could include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. In the case of a classification problem, a confusion matrix could be created to visualize the performance of the model.

Without more specific information from the provided context, it is impossible to determine if these exact postprocessing steps were carried out. However, these are common steps taken after model training, and the data collection methods described in the context suggest they could be applicable in this study.
