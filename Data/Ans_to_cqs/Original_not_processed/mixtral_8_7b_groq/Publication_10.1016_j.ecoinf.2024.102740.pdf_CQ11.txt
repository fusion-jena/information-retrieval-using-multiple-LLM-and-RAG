Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link for it. The methods described in the text involve using Random Forest (RF) for machine learning classification, not deep learning. The RF model was trained using 34 ground data points and validated with 8 samples. The system for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) software was employed for classification, based on Red Green Blue (RGB) images acquired in March, April, and May. The classification aimed to estimate grassland attributes like aboveground biomass, nutritive characteristics, and floristic composition. Therefore, I cannot provide a data repository link for a deep learning pipeline because it was not mentioned or discussed in the given context.
