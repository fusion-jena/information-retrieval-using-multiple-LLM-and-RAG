The text provided does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model after selecting the most effective one. However, it does mention that the model's performance was evaluated using a testing set, which suggests that the model was trained and validated before deployment.

Based on common practices in deep learning model deployment, we can infer that the following steps were likely taken:

1. Model serialization: Once the deep learning model was trained and validated, it was saved in a serialized format. Model serialization involves saving the model architecture, weights, and other relevant information in a file, which can be used for later deployment. This allows the model to be loaded and used without having to retrain it.
2. Platform selection: The serialized model was then deployed on a suitable platform for making predictions. This could be a local machine, a server, or a cloud-based platform. The choice of platform would depend on factors such as the expected volume of predictions, the required response time, and the available resources.
3. Integration with applications: The deployed model was then integrated with applications that required landscape type classification. This could involve creating APIs, libraries, or standalone executables that can be used to make predictions using the model.

It is important to note that the provided context does not explicitly confirm these steps. Therefore, while it is likely that these steps were followed, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer based on the information given.
