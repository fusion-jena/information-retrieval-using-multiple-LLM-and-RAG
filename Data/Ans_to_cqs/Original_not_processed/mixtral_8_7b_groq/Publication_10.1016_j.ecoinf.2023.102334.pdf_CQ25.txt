Answer:::
The deep learning model in question is a Vision Transformer (ViT) designed for image recognition tasks. According to the provided context, the primary purpose of this model is image classification.

ViT is a significant effort to employ a pure Transformer directly on images, showing that it can replace conventional convolution processes with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in image classification tasks. The model's Self Attention mechanism allows it to combine data from the entire image and accurately model long sequence information, which is crucial for image classification.

However, the training of the vanilla ViT model requires high computing costs, as mentioned in the context. To address this issue, a hybrid design that couples the Transformer with a CNN backbone, such as ResNet, is recommended. In this approach, the Transformer models global attention using the feature extracted by ResNet, delivering better performance with less computing work.

Although the context does not explicitly mention other tasks such as segmentation or object detection, it is worth noting that Transformers have been successfully applied to these tasks in the field of computer vision. For instance, Transformers have been used in conjunction with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for object detection in images, where the Transformer models long-range dependencies between objects.

In summary, based on the provided context, the primary purpose of the Vision Transformer (ViT) deep learning model is image classification. However, Transformers have also been successfully applied to other tasks such as segmentation and object detection in the field of computer vision.
