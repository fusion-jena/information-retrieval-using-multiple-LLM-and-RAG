Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the models is evaluated by comparing their predictions with the actual values of the target variable.

In the first piece of context, the performance of the Intuitionistic Fuzzy Transfer Learning (IFTL) model is compared with that of the Fuzzy Transfer Learning (FTL) model. This comparison is done to validate the effectiveness of hesitancy in restricting overconfidence during transfer learning (TL). The IFTL model outperformed the FTL model, indicating that it is better at capturing the uncertainty produced by extreme variations in data distribution or predictive tasks across the source and target data.

In the second piece of context, the IFTL model is implemented over the predictions of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models. The improvement of IFTL over these models is evaluated by comparing their errors. The errors of the IFTL model when implemented over the ELM, GRNN, and SVR models are denoted as 'ELM\_IF', 'GRNN\_IF', and 'SVR\_IF' respectively. This comparison allows us to infer that the IFTL model improves the knowledge transfer of the ELM, GRNN, and SVR models.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the performance of the models is evaluated by comparing their predictions with the actual values of the target variable. However, the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not mentioned in the provided context.
