Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana, as described in the paper by Gallwey et al., 2020.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to use regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. Some of the regularization methods include dropout, L2 regularization, data augmentation, and early stopping. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and less prone to overfitting. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights and helps to prevent overfitting. Data augmentation involves creating new training examples by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to the existing data. Early stopping is a technique where training is stopped as soon as the performance on a validation set starts to degrade.

While the paper by Gallwey et al., 2020 does not provide information on the specific regularization methods used, it does mention that they used a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for their deep learning model. CNNs are a type of neural network that are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks, and they have been shown to be effective in remote sensing applications. The authors also mention that they used a validation set to evaluate the performance of their model, which suggests that they may have used early stopping as a regularization technique.

In summary, while there is no specific information in the provided context about the regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana, it is common practice to use regularization techniques such as dropout, L2 regularization, data augmentation, and early stopping to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. The use of a validation set to evaluate the performance of the model suggests that early stopping may have been used as a regularization technique in this study.
