The provided context does not give information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Hyperparameter optimization is an important step in machine learning model training, where different values for parameters such as learning rate, batch size, or number of layers in a model are tested to find the best combination that results in the highest model performance. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. However, the context does not mention any of these methods or any other approach used for hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
