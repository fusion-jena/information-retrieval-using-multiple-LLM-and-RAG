Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text focuses on the comparison of different deep learning models for algal bloom forecasts in the Zhoushan fishery, but it does not mention any data augmentation methods. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
