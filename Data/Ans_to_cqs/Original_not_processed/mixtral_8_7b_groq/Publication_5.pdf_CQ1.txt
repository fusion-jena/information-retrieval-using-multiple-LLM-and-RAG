Answer:

The provided pieces of context do not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention various types of data that are used as inputs for training deep learning models in different applications.

For instance, in remote sensing, LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data, drone images, and satellite data are used as inputs for training deep learning models to estimate vascular plant richness, map raised bog vegetation communities, and predict monthly Arctic sea ice concentrations (29, 67, 68). In addition, public datasets such as ImageNet and MNIST are commonly used for training deep learning models in computer vision applications (65).

In the context of species richness estimation, the authors used LiDAR data collected using a "full-waveform airborne laser scanner" (29). LiDAR is a remote sensing technology that uses laser light to measure distances to objects on the ground, producing a 3D point cloud of the surveyed area.

In the context of drone image segmentation, the authors used drone images collected using a "multispectral camera" (67). Multispectral cameras capture images in multiple wavelength bands, allowing for the identification and segmentation of different types of vegetation.

In the context of Arctic sea ice concentration prediction, the authors used satellite data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) (68).

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly answer the query, it suggests that various remote sensing technologies, surveys, and public datasets are used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
