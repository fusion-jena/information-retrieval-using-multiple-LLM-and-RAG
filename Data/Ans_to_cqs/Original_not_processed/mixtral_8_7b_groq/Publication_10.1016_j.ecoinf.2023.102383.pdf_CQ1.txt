Answer:::

The provided context discusses a study that uses drone thermal imagery for deer survey, but it does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in general deep learning pipelines. However, it can be inferred from other sources that there are various methods for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines, including surveys, sensors, and public datasets.

Surveys can be a source of raw data for deep learning pipelines. For instance, in the study mentioned earlier, the authors used drone thermal imagery surveys to collect data for deer survey. Surveys can be conducted through various means, such as questionnaires, interviews, or observations.

Sensors are another source of raw data for deep learning pipelines. Sensors can be used to collect data in various fields, such as healthcare, transportation, or environmental monitoring. For example, sensors can be used to collect data on patients' vital signs, traffic flow, or air quality.

Public datasets are also a common source of raw data for deep learning pipelines. Public datasets are often available for various tasks, such as image classification, natural language processing, or speech recognition. These datasets can be used to train deep learning models and evaluate their performance.

In summary, surveys, sensors, and public datasets are common sources of raw data for deep learning pipelines. These methods allow for the collection of large amounts of data, which can be used to train deep learning models and develop intelligent systems.
