Answer:::
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the methods and techniques used in the development of a deep learning classifier, including the use of an ensemble of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures with varying input image sizes and a simple ResNet configuration. However, it does not mention where the data or code for this pipeline can be found. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to the repository.
