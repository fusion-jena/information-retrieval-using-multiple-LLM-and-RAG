Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention some metrics that were calculated during the evaluation of the models.

In section 3.3, it is mentioned that the plaice test set accuracy was calculated for the CLIP models and the fine-tuned models. The CLIP regression model performed the best, achieving 55.9% accuracy with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.70 years, and 97.05% accuracy when allowing a Â±1 year margin of error. 

Additionally, in the initial context, it is mentioned that the classification accuracy of the CLIP regression model rapidly increased during training until the training dataset size reached 200 images. When the training dataset size increased further, the accuracy slowly increased. This suggests that the classification accuracy was being monitored as a metric during the training process.

However, there is no information about other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices. Saliency maps are often used to visualize the parts of the input that the model is paying attention to, and confusion matrices are used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. But, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide information on these or any other specific postprocessing steps that were carried out.
