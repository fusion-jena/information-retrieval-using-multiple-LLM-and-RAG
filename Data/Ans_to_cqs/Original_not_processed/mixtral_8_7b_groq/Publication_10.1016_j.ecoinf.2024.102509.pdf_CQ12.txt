Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly stated. However, it is mentioned that an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model, which is a type of machine learning model, is used. ANN models can be considered a simple type of deep learning model, as they consist of interconnected layers of nodes or "neurons" that process information. However, ANN models are not as complex as other deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers, which have more specialized architectures designed for specific tasks.

The ANN model used in the study is a Backpropagation Neural Network (BP-ANN), which is a type of feedforward ANN. The BP-ANN used in the study consists of an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer has "n" covariates, the hidden layers have "p" hidden neurons, and the output layer has one output neuron. The selection of the number of hidden layers and neurons was determined through a process of trial and error.

The 'neuralnet' package of R 4.1.2 software was used to develop the BP-ANN model. The BP-ANN is trained using a supervised learning approach, where the model modifies the weights and biases of the network's neurons to minimize the gap between the anticipated output and the actual target values.

Therefore, while the specific type of deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the context, it can be inferred that a Backpropagation Neural Network (BP-ANN), which is a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and a simple type of deep learning model, is used in the study.
