Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the described pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically a variant of it called U-Net (M. El-Rawy et al., Ecological Informatics 81 (2024) 102652). This is evident from the given figure 6, which illustrates the structure of the proposed MU-Net model. CNNs are particularly suitable for image analysis tasks due to their ability to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from images, and U-Net is a CNN architecture that was developed for biomedical image segmentation (Ronneberger et al., 2015). U-Net consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path for precise localization, and it uses skip connections between the contracting and expanding paths to preserve high-resolution information. In this pipeline, the U-Net model is adapted for soil salinity segmentation using satellite images, with the addition of salinity indices such as NDSI and NDVI.
