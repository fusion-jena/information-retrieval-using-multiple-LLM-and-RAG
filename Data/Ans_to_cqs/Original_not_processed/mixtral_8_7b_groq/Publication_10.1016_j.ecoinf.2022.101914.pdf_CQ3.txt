Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline for this particular study does not seem to involve data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. This study focuses on ensemble models for species distribution modeling, using both regression-based and machine learning approaches. The data is divided into training and testing datasets using a spatial blocking technique, and background points for training the models are selected in multiples of the number of presences. However, there is no mention of data annotation techniques commonly used in computer vision tasks.

Answer:::
In summary, the study uses spatial blocking for dividing data into training and testing datasets and selects background points in multiples of the number of presences for training individual models. The deep learning pipeline does not involve data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
