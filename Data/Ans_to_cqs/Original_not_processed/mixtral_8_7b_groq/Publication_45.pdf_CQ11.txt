Answer:::

The specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Rammer and Seidl is not directly provided in the given context. However, it is mentioned that the data set used in the study is available online and was previously published by Seidl et al. (2015). The study by Seidl et al. (2016) provides more information on the dataset and statistical analyses of the data.

Based on this information, it can be inferred that the data repository link may be found in the study by Seidl et al. (2015) or related publications by the same authors. A search for the paper "Spatial risk analysis for European spruce bark beetle outbreaks: Operationalizing ecological models for management" by Seidl et al. (2015) may lead to the data repository link.

Additionally, the authors have stated that they will make their code and data publicly available on GitHub upon publication of their paper. Therefore, another possible way to access the data and code used in the study is to check the corresponding author's GitHub repository.

In summary, while the specific data repository link is not directly provided in the given context, it can be inferred that the data set used in the study is available online and can be accessed through a search for the paper by Seidl et al. (2015) or by checking the corresponding author's GitHub repository.
