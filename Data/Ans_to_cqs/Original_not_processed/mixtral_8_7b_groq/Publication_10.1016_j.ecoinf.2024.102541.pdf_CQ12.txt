Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the deep learning models used are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. 

In the handbook and several research papers, there are mentions of various types of CNNs such as Inception-v4, Inception-ResNet, and Dense convolutional neural networks. These CNNs are used for tasks like plant disease classification, wild animal detection, and multiclass plant disease detection.

Additionally, the context includes a paper titled "transformer meets convolutional neural network for plant disease classification" which indicates the use of a Transformer model in conjunction with a CNN for plant disease classification.

In summary, both CNNs and Transformers are used in the described pipelines, with CNNs being more prevalent and Transformers being used in combination with CNNs for specific tasks.
