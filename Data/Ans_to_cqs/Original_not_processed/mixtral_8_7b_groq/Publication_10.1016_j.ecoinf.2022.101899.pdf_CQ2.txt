Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning in estimating the best optimizer selection methods for wildfire event predictions in Australia, specifically focusing on the analysis of environmental conditions before and after wildfires occurred. However, the context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.

However, we can infer that the data format used in this study is likely to be image format, as the study extracted data from satellite images using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The images were analyzed to extract Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, which was then used to calculate mean NDVI scores and record the percentage of vegetation with low NDVI scores. This information was used to create a final dataset that included the mean NDVI score, month date stamp, and forest vulnerability as the percentage of vegetation with low NDVI scores.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is image format, specifically satellite images.
