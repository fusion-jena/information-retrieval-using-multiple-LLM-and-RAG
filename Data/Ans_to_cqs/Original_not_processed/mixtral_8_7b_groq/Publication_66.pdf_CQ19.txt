The text provided does not explicitly mention which framework was used to build the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the deep learning models were constructed in R using H2O. H2O is an open-source AI platform that offers a wide range of machine learning algorithms, including deep learning, and can be used with R, Python, and other programming languages. Therefore, it can be inferred that the H2O framework was used to build the deep learning model.
