Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet that are commonly used in deep learning. However, the text does refer to the use of climate data in the context of downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography using deep learning.

The study by Dujardin and Lehning (2022) used monthly average temperature datasets to train their deep learning models. These datasets were obtained by averaging a subset of monthly average temperatures from 1970-2000, resulting in 12 datasets, one for each month. The temperature data was likely obtained from a reliable meteorological source, although the specific source is not mentioned in the text.

Additionally, the study used various physiographic descriptors, such as elevation, slope, and aspect, to train their machine learning models. These descriptors were likely obtained from digital elevation models (DEMs) or other topographic data sources.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention any standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it does refer to the use of monthly average temperature datasets and various physiographic descriptors for training deep learning models.
