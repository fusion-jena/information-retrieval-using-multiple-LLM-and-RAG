The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mainly focuses on the use of a semi-supervised learning approach for tree detection in remote sensing, combining unsupervised and supervised methods to address the issue of limited training data. The unsupervised method is used to generate initial training data from Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data, and then a deep learning model is trained on this data. After that, the model is retrained based on a small number of hand-annotated trees to create the full model. However, it does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.
