Answer:

The text provided does not directly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, it does discuss the methods used to ensure the generalizability of a random forest (RF) model, which can provide some insight.

To ensure the generalizability of the RF model, the training samples were randomly divided into two sets, one for training and one for testing, in proportions of 80% and 20%, respectively. This is a common approach to ensure that the model can generalize well to new, unseen data.

Additionally, a grid search method based on out-of-bag (OOB) error and five-fold cross-validation was used to search for the optimal parameters of the model. Grid search is a hyperparameter tuning technique that involves systematically searching through a grid of possible hyperparameter values to find the combination that results in the best model performance. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a model will generalize to an independent data set. It involves dividing the data into k folds and training and evaluating the model k times, each time using a different fold as the test set. The average performance across the k runs is then used as the overall measure of model performance.

It is also mentioned that the training samples lacked low-value LAI samples, which resulted in the model not being able to predict low-value LAI accurately. This highlights the importance of having a diverse and representative dataset for training the model.

In summary, while the text does not directly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, it does discuss the use of random sampling, grid search, cross-validation, and a diverse dataset for the RF model. These are all common techniques used to ensure the generalizability of machine learning models.
