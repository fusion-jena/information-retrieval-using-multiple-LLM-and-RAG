The context does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions that a convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier was trained with a large dataset of 426,876 images, but it does not specify the computational hardware used for this task. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
