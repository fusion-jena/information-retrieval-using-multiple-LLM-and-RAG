I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not include information about data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. These techniques are commonly used in image processing and computer vision tasks to increase the amount and diversity of training data. However, the context focuses on data management, stewardship, and citation in the ESS-DIVE data repository, particularly in the context of data collections and dynamic data citations. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
