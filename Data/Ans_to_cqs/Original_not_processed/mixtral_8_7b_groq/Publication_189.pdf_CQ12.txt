Answer: The deep learning model used in the pipeline is Mask R-CNN, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Mask R-CNN is an extension of Faster R-CNN, a region-based CNN model that is widely used for object detection tasks. Mask R-CNN combines the object detection capabilities of Faster R-CNN with the semantic segmentation capabilities of FCN (Fully Convolutional Network) to provide instance segmentation, which is the task of detecting and segmenting each instance of an object in an image.

Mask R-CNN introduces a parallel FCN layer in the head of Faster R-CNN to predict the mask for each region of interest (RoI) along with the class label and bounding box coordinates. This is achieved by adding some extra convolutional layers on each RoI. The model is trained using a multi-task loss function that includes the loss for object detection and the loss for semantic segmentation.

In the given context, the Mask R-CNN model is implemented using TensorFlow version 1.14.0 and Keras version 2.2.4, along with Python 3.6. The model uses ResNet50 and ResNet101 as backbone structures and Anchor boxes of ratio 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512. The images used in the research have a fixed width and height of 640, resulting in an image shape of [a,640,640,3] and a mask shape of [a,640,640,1], where 'a' is the number of training images.

The model is trained for 20 epochs with 500 steps for training images and 100 steps for validation images. The learning rate for the heads layer training is taken as 0.001, which decays by 10 during all layers training. The loss values for the training and validation datasets are obtained separately and include the RPN anchor classifier loss, RPN bounding box loss, Mask R-CNN class loss, Mask R-CNN bounding box loss, and Mask R-CNN mask binary cross-entropy loss.

Therefore, Mask R-CNN is the deep learning model used in the pipeline, which is a type of CNN that combines object detection and semantic segmentation to provide instance segmentation.
