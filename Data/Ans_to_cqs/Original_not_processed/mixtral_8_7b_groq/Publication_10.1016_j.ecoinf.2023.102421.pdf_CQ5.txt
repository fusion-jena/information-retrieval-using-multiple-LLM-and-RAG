Answer:::
The provided context does not mention any deep learning pipelines or datasets commonly used in deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context focuses on the use of two machine learning algorithms, XGBoost and LightGBM, to estimate above-ground biomass (AGB) in a study area. The input dataset for this task is a tabulated format containing 268 sample plots with 39 features, derived from Sentinel 1A and Landsat 8 images and on-field AGB measurements.

The authors use a combination of Bayesian optimizers and Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TDO) to tune the hyperparameters of XGBoost and LightGBM. The algorithms are trained and validated using 80% of the dataset, while the remaining 20% is kept as unseen data for testing. The performance of the models is evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and R2 metrics.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not specified. Instead, the context focuses on the use of machine learning algorithms for AGB estimation using a specific dataset derived from Sentinel 1A and Landsat 8 images and on-field measurements.
