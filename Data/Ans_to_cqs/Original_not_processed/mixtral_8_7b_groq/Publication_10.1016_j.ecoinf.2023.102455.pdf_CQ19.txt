Answer:::

The context provided does not explicitly mention which deep learning frameworks were used to build the model. However, it does give a lot of information about the architecture and parameters of the model, which can give us some clues.

The model is a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Networks (BiRNNs). These are all types of neural networks that are commonly implemented in deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. 

The context also mentions the use of the Adam optimizer, which is a type of optimization algorithm used during the training of deep learning models. The Adam optimizer is available in both TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of the 'relu' activation function, which is a common activation function used in deep learning models. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch support the 'relu' activation function.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework was used, the details provided suggest that the model could have been built using either TensorFlow or PyTorch, as both of these frameworks support the types of neural networks, optimization algorithms, and activation functions mentioned in the context.
