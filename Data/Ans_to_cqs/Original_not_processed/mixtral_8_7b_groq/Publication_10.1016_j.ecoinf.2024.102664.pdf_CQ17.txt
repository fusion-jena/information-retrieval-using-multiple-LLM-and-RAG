Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of different solvers for training networks, such as Adam, SGDM, and RMSProp, as well as the input time series length for deep learning models.

Regularization methods are commonly used in machine learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. This penalty term discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data that may not generalize well to new, unseen data.

Two common regularization methods are L2 regularization and dropout. L2 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which can help prevent overfitting. Dropout, on the other hand, randomly sets a fraction of the model's activations to zero during training. This helps prevent overfitting by effectively training multiple different sub-models, which can improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Without more information from the provided context, it is difficult to say for sure which regularization methods were used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is likely that one or both of these methods were used to prevent overfitting.
