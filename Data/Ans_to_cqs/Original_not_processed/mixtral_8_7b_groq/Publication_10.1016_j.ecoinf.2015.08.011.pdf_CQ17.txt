The provided context discusses the use of early stopping as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting in the development of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for predicting water quality. However, it does not mention any other regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Early stopping is a form of regularization that involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training and stopping the training process once the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade. This helps to prevent the model from overfitting to the training data.

Dropout is another regularization technique that is commonly used in deep learning. It involves randomly dropping out, or "turning off," a certain percentage of the neurons in a layer during training. This helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons and promoting the learning of more robust features.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a regularization technique that involves adding a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This helps to prevent overfitting by discouraging the learning of overly large weights and promoting the learning of more generalizable features.

In summary, the provided context discusses the use of early stopping as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting in the development of an ANN for predicting water quality. However, it does not mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization.
