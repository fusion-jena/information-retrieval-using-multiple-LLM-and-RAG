The context provided discusses the use of the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models for predicting Above Ground Biomass (AGB) using data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization.

In the case of the RF model, the study systematically evaluated the hyperparameter "mtry" from 1 to 10, aiming to strike a balance between stability and minimizing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). However, the method used to evaluate these values is not specified.

For the ANN model, the study used the CARET package in R, which fits a single hidden-layer neural network with two hyperparameters: size (number of units in the hidden layer) and decay (regularization parameter to avoid overfitting). The optimum combination of parameters for the best model fit was based on accuracy. Again, the method used to find the optimum combination is not specified.

In conclusion, while the context provides information about the hyperparameters used in the models, it does not explicitly mention the use of grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization. It is possible that other methods, such as manual tuning or exhaustive search, were used instead. Without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
