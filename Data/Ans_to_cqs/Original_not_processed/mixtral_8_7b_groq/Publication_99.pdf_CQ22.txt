Answer:::

The performance of the deep learning models discussed in the context is evaluated using Peak Signal-To-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). 

The PConv network's performance is evaluated using SSIM, which measures the similarity between two images based on luminance, contrast, and structural information. The original implementation of the PConv network required a two-phase training process due to the generated holes' problem in the batch normalization layer. However, in this study, all models were trained in a single process while freezing the batch normalization layer in the encoder part. The models were optimized using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0002 and evaluated using the validation set after each training epoch. The best model was saved based on a validation loss.

On the other hand, the Pix2Pix network's performance is evaluated using both SSIM and PSNR metrics. Pix2Pix models were trained for 50 epochs, and after every 500 iterations, the generator models' performance was evaluated using SSIM and PSNR metrics. The model was saved as the best model if it improved the performance on the validation set compared to previous iterations.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention any other metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall, which are commonly used to evaluate classification models. Therefore, it can be inferred that these metrics were not used to evaluate the performance of the models discussed in the context.
