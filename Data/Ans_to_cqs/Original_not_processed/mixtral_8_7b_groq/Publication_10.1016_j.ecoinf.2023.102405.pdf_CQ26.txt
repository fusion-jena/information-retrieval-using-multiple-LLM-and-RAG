The provided text discusses various data pre-processing techniques, including data imputation and capping, but it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during the pre-processing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does touch upon some related concepts that can be indirectly linked to addressing data bias.

One such method is data segregation, as discussed in the context of IoT-based real-time data collection in the study of water contamination in aquaculture. Data segregation can help create more homogeneous subsets of the data, potentially reducing bias that might arise from combining disparate data sources or classes.

Additionally, the text mentions data imputation using mean imputation, which can be used to address missing data. While not directly related to data bias, mean imputation can help ensure that the dataset is complete and may indirectly contribute to reducing bias if missing data are not randomly distributed.

The text also mentions capping, a method used to limit dataset values within allowed parameters. While not explicitly a technique for addressing data bias, capping can help ensure that extreme values do not skew the dataset and potentially introduce bias.

Lastly, the text highlights the importance of data collection in addressing water contamination issues. Diverse data collection can help ensure that the dataset is representative and less prone to bias.

In summary, while the provided text does not explicitly mention techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection for addressing data bias during pre-processing, it does touch upon related concepts such as data segregation, data imputation, capping, and data collection that can indirectly contribute to reducing bias in a dataset.
