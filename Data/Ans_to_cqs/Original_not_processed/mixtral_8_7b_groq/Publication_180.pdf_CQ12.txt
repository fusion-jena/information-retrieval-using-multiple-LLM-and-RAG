The specific type of deep learning model used in the automated Chagas disease vector identification system is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a strong candidate for the model used.

The project aimed to improve the classification of 12 Mexican and 39 Brazilian triatomine species, which are vectors of Chagas disease. TensorFlow, an open-source software platform for deep learning, was employed for this task. TensorFlow supports various deep learning models, including CNNs, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers.

The choice of a CNN as the deep learning model is suggested by the nature of the problem and the data used. CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks, as they excel at detecting and learning patterns in grid-like data, such as images. In this project, the system was trained based on 405 images for Mexican triatomine species and 1,584 images for Brazilian triatomine species. Thus, a CNN would be a logical choice for this image-based classification challenge.

In summary, while the specific deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a strong candidate based on the nature of the problem and the data used.
