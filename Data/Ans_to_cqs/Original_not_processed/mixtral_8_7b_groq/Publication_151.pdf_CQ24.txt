Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it is mentioned that the training process uses a running average of the recent magnitude of the gradient to speed up training, and the batch size is fixed to 32. These could be considered strategies to introduce some level of consistency in the training process. Additionally, the training is stopped when the value of the loss function fails to decrease in two consecutive checks, which could be seen as a way to ensure that the training is not unduly influenced by random fluctuations in the loss function. However, the context does not provide enough information to give a definitive answer to the query.
