Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, we can infer some steps from the context.

First, the authors generate training and testing datasets by digitizing areas dominated by target communities as polygons and extracting all pixels contained within those polygons. Then, they split these polygons into calibration and validation sets, reserving ~30% of pixels for independent model validation. This step might involve some cleaning of the data, such as removing outliers or erroneous measurements.

Second, the authors use a Python implementation of the XGBoostClassifier, which is a machine learning algorithm that develops optimized random trees by learning from the errors of those previous. As input to the ML algorithm, they use seasonal vegetation index composites from Sentinel-2 (S2), backscatter composites from Sentinel-1 (S1), elevation, and slope, totaling up to 54 features. Before using these features as input, they might perform some normalization or scaling to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model's performance.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, it is likely that some data cleaning, normalization, or scaling takes place during the generation and processing of the training and testing datasets.
