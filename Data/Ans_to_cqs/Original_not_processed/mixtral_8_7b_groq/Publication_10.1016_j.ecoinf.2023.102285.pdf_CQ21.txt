Answer:::

The provided documents do not give detailed information about the postprocessing steps involved immediately after the model training. However, they do mention some steps that are carried out to evaluate the performance of the models, which can be inferred as part of the postprocessing phase.

In the 2013 study by Kuru et al., they introduced a novel report generation approach for medical applications, the SIDS methodology. Although the specific postprocessing steps are not mentioned, they do discuss the evaluation of their methodology. They provide a summary of the findings (Section 4) and discussions (Section 5) based on the results obtained from their experiments.

In the 2023 study by Kuru et al., they developed Wildetect, an intelligent platform to perform airborne wildlife census automatically in the marine ecosystem using an ensemble of learning techniques and computer vision. After training their model, they calculated several metrics to evaluate its performance. These metrics include sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy (ACC). They also presented a detailed confusion matrix (Table 10) to provide a better understanding of the classification results.

The 2015 study by Leira et al. focused on automatic detection, classification, and tracking of objects in the ocean surface from UAVs using a thermal camera. Although the postprocessing steps are not explicitly stated, they presented Figures 12b, 13b, 14b, and 16b, which seem to be examples of the model's output. These figures might represent a part of the postprocessing phase, where the model's predictions are visualized for further analysis.

In general, postprocessing steps after model training can include:

1. Metrics calculation: Calculating various evaluation metrics, such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess the performance of the model.
2. Confusion matrix: Creating a confusion matrix to visualize the classification results, which helps to understand the errors made by the model.
3. Saliency maps: Generating saliency maps to visualize the regions of the input data that the model focuses on the most, which can provide insights into the model's decision-making process.
4. Model visualization: Visualizing the model's predictions, especially in the case of image or object detection tasks, to ensure the model is working as expected.

Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided documents, these postprocessing steps are common practices in evaluating and understanding the performance of machine learning models.
