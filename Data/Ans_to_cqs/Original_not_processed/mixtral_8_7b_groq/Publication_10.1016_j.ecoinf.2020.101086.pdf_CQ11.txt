Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not contain the necessary information to answer your query. The context discusses research related to species distribution models (SDMs) and the use of presence sites in building these models. However, it does not mention or provide a link to a deep learning pipeline or any data repository.

The context references two studies: Moua et al., 2017 and Wisz et al., 2008. The Moua et al., 2017 study presents examples of presence sites (pres\_UNB and pres\_B) for a specific value of k in Figure 4. The Wisz et al., 2008 study explores the effects of sample size on the performance of SDMs. Nonetheless, neither of these studies provides the required information about the deep learning pipeline data repository.

I hope this clarifies the situation, and I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. If you have any further questions or need more information, please feel free to ask.
