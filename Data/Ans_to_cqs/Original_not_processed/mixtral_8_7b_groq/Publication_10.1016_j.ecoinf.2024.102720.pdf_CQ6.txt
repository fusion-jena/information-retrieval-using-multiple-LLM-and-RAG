Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it is generally acknowledged in the field of machine learning that data preprocessing is a crucial step in the model-building process. Preprocessing can include various steps such as data cleaning, normalization, scaling, and transformation.

Data cleaning involves handling missing or corrupted data points, while normalization and scaling are used to adjust the range and distribution of the data. Transformation can include techniques such as dimensionality reduction or feature engineering.

In the context of deep learning, normalization and scaling are commonly used to ensure that the input data is within a suitable range for the model. This can help to improve the model's convergence and accuracy. For instance, in the study by Ren et al. (2023), the authors used a deep learning algorithm for strategic planning and normalized the data before training the model.

Therefore, while the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned in the provided context, it is reasonable to assume that data preprocessing techniques such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning were employed before training the deep learning models in the studies mentioned.
