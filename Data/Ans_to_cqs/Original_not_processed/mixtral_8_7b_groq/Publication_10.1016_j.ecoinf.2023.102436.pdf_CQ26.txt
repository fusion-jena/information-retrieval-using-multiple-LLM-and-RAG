The provided context does not directly discuss data bias techniques in the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss a study related to landscape design and ecological restoration, which might use such techniques during their data preprocessing phase.

In the context, the researchers seem to have used a balanced data collection approach, focusing on different areas of the park for tree plantation and water landscape addition. This suggests that they were aware of the need for balanced data representation and considered the spatial distribution of features in their study area.

In the context of landscape design and ecological restoration, data bias techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling might be applied in the following ways:

1. Stratified splitting: When dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, the researchers could ensure that each set has a balanced representation of various landscape elements (e.g., tree cover, water bodies, and building proximity). This would help maintain the overall diversity of the dataset and ensure that the model generalizes well to different scenarios.

2. Oversampling: If certain classes or categories of landscape elements are underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to balance the class distribution. For example, if there are fewer instances of water bodies in the dataset, oversampling can be applied to create more synthetic samples, ensuring that the model learns from a balanced dataset.

3. Undersampling: Conversely, if certain classes or categories are overrepresented in the dataset, undersampling can be used to balance the class distribution. For example, if there are too many instances of tree cover in the dataset, undersampling can be applied to reduce the number of samples, ensuring that the model does not get biased towards tree cover.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention data bias techniques, it suggests that the researchers were aware of the importance of balanced data representation. In a landscape design and ecological restoration context, techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling could be applied to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.
