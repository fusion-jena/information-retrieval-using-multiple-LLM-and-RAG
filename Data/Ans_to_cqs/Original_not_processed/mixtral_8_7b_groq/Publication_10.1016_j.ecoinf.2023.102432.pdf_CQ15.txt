Based on the provided context, the text does not mention any specific deep learning optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. The context focuses on comparing the Multiple-instance Multiple-layer Perceptron with Spatial Mixture of Gaussians (MTMI-SMF) classification approach to the Random Forest classification method in remote sensing for land cover classification, specifically for dealing with imperfect training data.

MTMI-SMF is a multiple-instance learning algorithm that groups pixels into bags and assigns a positive or negative label to the bag, rather than assigning a label to individual pixels. This approach allows for errors in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) locations, mixed pixels, and other inaccuracies in training data.

On the other hand, Random Forest is a common machine learning algorithm that requires a single pixel's spectrum to be associated with a single metadata record. In the context, a random pixel from the pixels in closest proximity to the training location was selected for analysis.

Therefore, the provided context does not mention any optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as SGD or Adam.
