Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for CASE (Computer-Aided System for Environmental Surveillance). The text focuses on the data platform, its architecture, and data sources, but it does not mention any specific optimization techniques for the deep learning models.

However, it is important to note that optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), and others are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to minimize the loss function and improve model performance. The choice of optimization technique depends on various factors, such as the complexity of the model, the size and quality of the dataset, and the specific problem being addressed.

Given that the CASE system relies on deep learning models for environmental surveillance and data analysis, it is reasonable to assume that some optimization techniques are being employed. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to this query.
