Answer:::

The provided context does not give information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in training machine learning models, and various methods such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and more can be used. However, the text does not mention any of these techniques being used. It only mentions that the model was trained again on annotated scans and tested on a different un-annotated dataset, with hand-annotated scans used for evaluating the average precision metric. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
