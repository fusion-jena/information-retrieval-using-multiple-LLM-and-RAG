Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository link. The mentioned studies primarily focus on machine learning algorithms, particularly support vector networks and random forests, for land use and land cover (LULC) classification using remote sensing data.

The context describes the random forest (RF) approach, where the "randomForest" package was used, and the model set the number of trees (ntree) and features in each split (mtry) by default. However, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository link.

In summary, I cannot provide the requested information since it is not present in the given context.
