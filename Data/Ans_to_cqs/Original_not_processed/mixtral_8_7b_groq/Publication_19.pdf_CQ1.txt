Answer:

In the deep learning pipeline for animal classification using camera trap images, the raw data is collected using camera traps, which are remote, motion-activated cameras that take pictures or videos of wildlife. These cameras are strategically placed in the wilderness to monitor animal movements and behaviors. The images captured by the camera traps are then used as the dataset for training, validating, and testing the deep learning models.

In this research, the dataset consists of 33,984 images taken during day and night with six animal classes. The specific types of animals in the dataset are not mentioned, but the models are trained to classify the images into one of the six animal classes.

To build the dataset, the researchers could have conducted a survey to determine the best locations for placing the camera traps. The survey could have been based on factors such as the type of habitat, the presence of animal signs, and the density of the animal population. Once the camera traps were placed, they would have collected images over a period of time, providing a large dataset for the deep learning models.

The dataset could have also been obtained from public datasets or a combination of public datasets and privately collected data. However, the context does not provide information on whether public datasets were used.

In summary, the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected using camera traps, which are remote, motion-activated cameras that take pictures or videos of wildlife. The images captured by the camera traps are then used as the dataset for training, validating, and testing the deep learning models. The dataset could have been built through a survey to determine the best locations for placing the camera traps or obtained from public datasets or a combination of public datasets and privately collected data.
