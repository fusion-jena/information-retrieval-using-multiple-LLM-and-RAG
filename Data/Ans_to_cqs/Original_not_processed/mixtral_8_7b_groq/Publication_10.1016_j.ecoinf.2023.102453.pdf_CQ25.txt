Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning model, as discussed in the context, is for image classification. Specifically, it is used for animal classification in the context of camera trap data on edge devices. The models being compared include various deep neural network models, and the goal is to find the best model based on factors such as model size, performance, training and inference time, computational complexity, and ease of use.

The models being considered include EfficientNetB0, which was found to have the best performance among the selected small-sized models. Additionally, the paper explores the use of transfer learning with fine-tuning to improve the performance of these models.

It's worth noting that the context also discusses two different types of models: convolution-based architectures and transformer-based architectures. Convolution-based architectures have been traditionally used for image classification tasks, while transformer-based architectures have been used more recently for natural language processing tasks. However, the concepts of attention have been applied to image classification problems, leading to the development of vision transformers.

While the context does not explicitly state the specific type of deep learning model being used (classification, segmentation, detection), the focus on animal classification and the comparison of different models based on their performance suggest that the purpose of the deep learning model in this case is for image classification.
