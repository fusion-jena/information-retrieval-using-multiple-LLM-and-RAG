Answer:::

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include 90° rotation and vertical and horizontal flips.

The context provided mentions that data augmentation was applied to all extracted patches, with specific techniques specified: a 90° rotation and vertical and horizontal flips. However, it does not mention scaling as one of the data augmentation techniques used in this particular deep learning pipeline.

It is worth noting that data augmentation is an important technique used to increase the amount of training data, as well as to prevent overfitting of the model to the training data. By applying various transformations to the training data, such as rotations, flips, and scaling, the model is able to learn more robust features that can generalize better to unseen data.

In addition to the data augmentation techniques mentioned in the context, there are several other techniques that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. These include:

* Translations: shifting the image horizontally or vertically by a few pixels
* Zooming: randomly zooming in or out of the image
* Brightness and contrast adjustments: changing the brightness or contrast of the image
* Color jittering: randomly changing the hue, saturation, or value of the image
* Channel shuffling: randomly swapping the color channels of the image

These techniques can be used alone or in combination with each other to further increase the diversity of the training data and improve the generalization capacity of the deep learning classifiers.
