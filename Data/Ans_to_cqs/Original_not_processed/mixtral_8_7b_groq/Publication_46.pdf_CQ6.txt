Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it does not mention specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning that are involved before training a deep learning model using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). However, it is important to note that preprocessing is a crucial step in deep learning model development, and the choice of preprocessing techniques depends on the nature of the data and the specific problem being addressed.

In general, preprocessing steps for deep learning models can include:

1. Data cleaning: This involves removing or correcting erroneous or missing data points.
2. Data normalization: This involves scaling the data to a common range, such as 0 to 1, to prevent features with large values from dominating the learning process.
3. Data augmentation: This involves artificially increasing the size of the dataset by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, or flipping to the existing data. This can help improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.
4. Feature extraction: This involves transforming the raw data into a set of features that are more informative and relevant for the problem at hand. In the context of the provided article, feature extraction is performed using convolution and pooling layers.

Therefore, while the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps, it is clear that feature extraction is an important step in the development of a deep learning model using a CNN. Additionally, it is likely that other preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, normalization, and augmentation were performed, but are not explicitly mentioned in the text.
