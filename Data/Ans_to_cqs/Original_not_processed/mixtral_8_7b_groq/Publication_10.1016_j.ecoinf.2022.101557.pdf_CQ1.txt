Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline discussed in the paper. However, it does mention that the data used in this study is related to wetlands in southern Sweden, and that it undergoes processes such as data pre-processing (splitting into blocks and smaller areas), prediction using a convolutional neural network (CNN), and data post-processing (rounding pixel predictions and converting to a vector representation).

Given that the study focuses on ecological informatics, it is likely that the data was collected using methods common in ecological research, such as field surveys, remote sensing (e.g., satellite or aerial imagery), or existing public datasets. However, without further information from the paper or the authors, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.

In future studies, the authors suggest investigating the amount of data needed for model training, using existing annotated datasets for building AI models, and generating synthetic samples from annotated datasets using generative adversarial models. These methods could potentially be used for augmenting or refining the raw data used in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data, it suggests that the data is related to ecological informatics and undergoes various pre-processing, prediction, and post-processing steps. Future studies could explore using existing annotated datasets and generating synthetic samples for augmenting or refining the raw data.
