Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for fish biomass estimation. However, it can be inferred that underwater videos are likely used as the primary source of data.

In the context, it is mentioned that the problem of estimating fish biomass in turbid water is formulated using underwater videos. This implies that underwater video recordings are used to capture the necessary data for the deep learning model. These videos can be obtained through various means, such as specialized underwater cameras or sensors designed for aquatic environments.

While the context does not explicitly mention other data collection methods like surveys or public datasets, it does emphasize the importance of large datasets for training deep learning models. These datasets can be compiled from various sources, including existing public datasets, self-collected data through underwater video recordings, or a combination of both.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly list the methods used for collecting raw data, it can be inferred that underwater videos are the primary source of data. Other potential data collection methods, such as surveys or public datasets, may also be used to compile large datasets for training deep learning models in the fish biomass estimation pipeline.
