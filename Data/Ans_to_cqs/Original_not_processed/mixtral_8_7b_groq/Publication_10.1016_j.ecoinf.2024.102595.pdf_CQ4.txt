Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on data preprocessing techniques like transformation using MinMaxScaler and LabelEncoder, as well as model training, validation, and testing procedures. However, it does not discuss data augmentation techniques.

Data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to increase the diversity of the training data by applying random transformations to the existing data. This can help improve the model's ability to generalize and reduce overfitting. Common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, and scaling images in computer vision tasks.

Therefore, while the text provides valuable information about the data preprocessing and model training procedures, it does not directly answer the query about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
