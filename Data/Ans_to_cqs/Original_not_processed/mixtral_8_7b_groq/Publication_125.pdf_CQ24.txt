Answer:::

The provided context discusses various aspects of deep learning (DL) models, privacy-preservation techniques, and satellite image classification. However, it does not directly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of random seed values.

In general, randomness in deep learning models can be handled through various strategies, such as:

1. Initialization of weights: Deep learning models typically initialize weights randomly, following certain distributions (e.g., Gaussian or uniform distribution) to break symmetry and ensure that different neurons learn different features.

2. Dropout: During training, dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of input neurons to zero, preventing overfitting and improving the model's generalization.

3. Data shuffling: To ensure that the model does not learn patterns from a specific order in the dataset, data is often shuffled before each epoch during training.

4. Regularization: Techniques like L1 and L2 regularization introduce randomness by adding a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and preventing overfitting.

5. Batch normalization: This technique normalizes the inputs of each batch, introducing randomness by re-scaling and re-centering the inputs.

6. Learning rate scheduling: Adaptive learning rate methods, like Adam or RMSprop, adjust the learning rate dynamically during training, introducing randomness in the learning process.

7. Early stopping: This technique stops training when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving, preventing overfitting and introducing randomness in the number of training iterations.

The context provided does not mention any specific strategy for handling randomness in the DL pipeline related to random seed values. However, deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch allow users to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility in their experiments. This practice can help researchers compare results consistently across different runs.

In summary, the provided context does not discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline related to random seed values. However, deep learning models employ various strategies to handle randomness, as mentioned above. Researchers can control reproducibility using random seed values in deep learning frameworks.
