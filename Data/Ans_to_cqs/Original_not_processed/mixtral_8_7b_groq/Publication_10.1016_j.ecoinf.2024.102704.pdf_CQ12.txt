Answer: Based on the provided context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is inferred from the mention of various components and techniques that are specific to CNNs, such as convolutional layers, batch normalization, ReLU activation, and the implementation of depthwise separable convolutions (DWConv). The context also discusses the impact of memory access on the performance of these models, which is a crucial factor in CNNs due to their high computational complexity. However, the specific variant of CNN (like ResNet, Inception V3, DenseNet, etc.) is not mentioned in the provided text.
