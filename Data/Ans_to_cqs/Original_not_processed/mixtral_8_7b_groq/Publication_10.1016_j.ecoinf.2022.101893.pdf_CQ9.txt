Answer:::

The provided context does not mention or give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the design of a network with four convolution kernel pooling layers, feature selection using deep learning, and result analysis of various features and models. However, it does not specify where the data or code for this pipeline is stored or made available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
