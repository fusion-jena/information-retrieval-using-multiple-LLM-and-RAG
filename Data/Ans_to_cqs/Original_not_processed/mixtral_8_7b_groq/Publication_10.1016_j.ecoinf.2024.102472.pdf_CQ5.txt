Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline related to Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLPNN) or other types of deep learning models. Commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, CIFAR for image classification, and ImageNet for large-scale image recognition. However, the context focuses on the application of MLPNN in estimating carbon stocks using hyperspectral image classification, integrated multispectral and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, and Sentinel-2 spectral data. The datasets used in these studies are not explicitly mentioned.

In the study by De Lucia et al. (2022), the authors used hyperspectral image classification for explainable AI in edge computing environments, but the specific dataset is not provided. Similarly, Domingues et al. (2020) used artificial neural networks on integrated multispectral and SAR data for high-performance prediction of eucalyptus biomass, but the dataset is not specified.

In the case of Douwes et al. (2015), the Buffelsdraai Landfill Site Community Reforestation Project is mentioned, but there is no information on the dataset used. Dube and Mutanga (2015) used Landsat 8 multispectral sensor data for quantifying aboveground biomass in uMgeni catchment, South Africa, but it is not explicitly stated if this is the dataset used in a deep learning pipeline.

Memon et al. (2019) used PolSAR image classification, but the dataset is not provided. Miller (2014) discussed 520,000 Years of Environmental Change in West Africa, but it is unrelated to deep learning datasets. Mngadi et al. (2021a, b) used Sentinel-2 spectral data and Sentinel-1 and 2 imagery for quantifying above-ground carbon stock and commercial forest species mapping, respectively, but the datasets are not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned.
