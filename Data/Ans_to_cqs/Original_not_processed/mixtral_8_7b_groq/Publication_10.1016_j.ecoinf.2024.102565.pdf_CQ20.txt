Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that MATLAB programming software was used for crafting and assessing the models. MATLAB supports GPU computing, so it is possible that GPUs were used for training the model. It is not mentioned if TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) were used. Therefore, based on the given context, we can only infer that GPUs might have been used for training the deep learning model.
