Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning before training an artificial neural network (ANN), which is a type of deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the weights of the ANN were randomly initialized using the Nguyen-Widrow method, and a stratified sampling method was applied for model fitting and evaluation.

Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures each stratum or subset of the population is proportionally represented in the sample. This technique can help ensure that the training and validation datasets are representative of the entire population, which can improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

In addition, the context mentions that variable importance measures were employed to evaluate the significance of variables and identify the most influential variables for predicting aboveground biomass (AGB). This suggests that some preprocessing or feature selection may have been performed to prepare the data for modeling.

Normalization and scaling are common preprocessing steps used in deep learning to ensure that inputs are on a similar scale and to improve the model's ability to learn. Normalization typically involves transforming data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, while scaling involves transforming data to a specific range, such as 0 to 1.

Cleaning is another important preprocessing step that involves removing or correcting errors, inconsistencies, or missing values in the data. This can help improve the quality of the data and the model's ability to learn from it.

Overall, while the provided context does not explicitly mention specific preprocessing steps for training an ANN, it is likely that some preprocessing, such as feature selection, normalization, scaling, or cleaning, was performed to prepare the data for modeling.
