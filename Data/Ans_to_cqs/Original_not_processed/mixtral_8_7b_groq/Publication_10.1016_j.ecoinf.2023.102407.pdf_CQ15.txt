Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning methods, such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and MaxEnt, for species distribution modeling. However, it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Optimization techniques are essential for training deep learning models, as they help minimize the difference between the predicted and actual values, also known as the loss function. Some common optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters by computing the gradient of the loss function concerning each parameter. SGD is computationally efficient, but it may converge slowly and get stuck in local minima.

Adam is a popular optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of Adagrad and RMSprop. Adam adaptively adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the first and second moments of the gradient. It is computationally efficient, requires little memory, and is less sensitive to the choice of the learning rate.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot determine the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for species distribution modeling. However, it is reasonable to assume that optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam are used to train the deep learning models.
