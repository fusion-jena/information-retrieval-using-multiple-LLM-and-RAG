Answer:::

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include horizontal flips, adding or subtracting intensity, Guassian blur, additive Gaussian noise, and fog simulation. These techniques are used simultaneously during the training process for both images and videos. Specifically, for video data, temporal jittering, spatial crops, and horizontal flips are used for action recognition tasks.

For each input video, temporal jittering selects the starting point of the 16 frames randomly, with the constraint that there are 16 frames after the starting point in the video. The videos in the action recognition dataset are between 3 and 9 seconds long, consisting of 24 to 72 frames.

In the case of images, horizontal flips, adding or subtracting intensity, Guassian blur, and additive Gaussian noise are applied with a probability of 90%. Fog simulation is a more robust technique and is therefore applied with a probability of 10%. However, fog simulation is combined only with random horizontal flips due to its strength.

These data augmentation techniques help prevent overfitting, improve model performance, and increase the robustness of the models. They enable the models to generalize better and handle a wider variety of inputs.
