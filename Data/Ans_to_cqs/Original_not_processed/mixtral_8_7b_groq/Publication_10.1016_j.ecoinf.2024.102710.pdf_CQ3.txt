The provided context discusses the use of transfer learning and active learning as techniques to reduce the amount of time needed for annotating Physio Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) datasets. However, it does not directly mention any specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for computer vision tasks include:

1. Image-level classification: This is the simplest form of annotation where an image is assigned a single label indicating the presence or absence of a particular object class.
2. Bounding box annotation: This involves drawing a bounding box around an object of interest in an image. It allows the model to learn the spatial location and extent of the object.
3. Semantic segmentation: This is a pixel-wise annotation technique where each pixel in an image is assigned a label indicating the object class it belongs to.
4. Instance segmentation: This is a more advanced form of semantic segmentation where each instance of an object class is segmented and distinguished from other instances of the same class.

For audio data, common annotation techniques include:

1. Audio-level classification: Similar to image-level classification, an audio file is assigned a single label indicating the presence or absence of a particular sound event.
2. Time-series annotation: This involves annotating sound events at specific time points or intervals within an audio file.
3. Spectrogram annotation: This involves annotating sound events on a spectrogram representation of the audio data.

In the context of the study, it appears that the annotation technique used for the PAM datasets is audio-level classification, as the models are evaluated based on their classification accuracy for sound event detection. However, the specific annotation technique is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
