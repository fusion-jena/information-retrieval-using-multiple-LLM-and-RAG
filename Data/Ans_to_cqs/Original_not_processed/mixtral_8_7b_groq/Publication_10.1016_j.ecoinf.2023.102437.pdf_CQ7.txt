Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it does mention that the LSTM models were built with one layer of 65 neurons, and a batch size of 32 with 500 epochs was used. It also mentions that the weight wm was obtained using the training dataset Dm, and the prediction from time tm using the signature xm yielded the value Ì‚ym+ma, which was compared with the validation data ym+ma. This suggests that the data was split into training and validation sets, where the training set was used to train the model and obtain the weights, and the validation set was used to evaluate the model's performance. However, there is no mention of a separate test set, which is typically used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Additionally, the context also mentions that the procedure was repeated after incrementing the time index m, which implies that the data was likely split into multiple segments based on time, and the model was trained and validated on each segment sequentially. This approach is known as time series cross-validation, which is commonly used in time series forecasting to assess the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Furthermore, the context also mentions that the size of the training data |Dm| = m (cid:0) ma (cid:0) mb + 1 depended on the starting time tm, which suggests that the data was split based on the starting time of the forecast. This is a common practice in time series forecasting, where the data is split into training and validation sets based on a fixed window size, and the model is trained and validated on different starting times of the window.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it suggests that the data was split into training and validation sets based on time, and the model was trained and validated on different starting times of a fixed window size. Additionally, there is no mention of a separate test set, which is typically used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
