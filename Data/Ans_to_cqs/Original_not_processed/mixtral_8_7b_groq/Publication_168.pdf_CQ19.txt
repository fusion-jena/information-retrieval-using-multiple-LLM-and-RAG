Answer:::

The specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models in the given context are not mentioned. However, the models were implemented and tested using IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, which suggests that the models were built using a general-purpose programming language such as Python, along with deep learning libraries.

Common deep learning frameworks for building Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) include TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and Caffe. Among these, TensorFlow and PyTorch are the most popular and widely used.

In the context provided, the models were built for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, which involves processing large volumes of spectral and spatial data. Therefore, a deep learning framework that can efficiently handle large datasets and provide GPU acceleration would be preferred. TensorFlow and PyTorch are both well-suited for such tasks.

In summary, while the specific deep learning framework used to build the models in the given context is not mentioned, TensorFlow and PyTorch are popular and widely used frameworks for building CNNs and would be suitable for HSI classification tasks.
