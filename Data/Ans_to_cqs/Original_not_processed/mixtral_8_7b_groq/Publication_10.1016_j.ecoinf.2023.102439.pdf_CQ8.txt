Unfortunately, there is no information available in the provided context about a code repository for a deep learning pipeline. The text discusses various studies related to land surface temperature (LST) retrieval, groundwater level prediction, pistachio yield prediction, and spatio-temporal land use and land cover changes. However, none of these studies mention or provide a code repository for a deep learning pipeline.

The LST retrieval study derives the LST dataset from infrared radiations measured on channels 31 and 32 using the MODIS-TERRA sensor. It uses an equation provided by Artis and Carnahan in 1982 to calculate LST from MODIS Terra MOD11A2.

The groundwater level prediction study combines wavelet transformation with machine learning techniques to enhance prediction accuracy. It employs various methods, including classification and regression trees, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and a hybrid model that merges support vector machines with the firefly meta-heuristic algorithm.

The pistachio yield prediction study assesses the influence of soil properties on pistachio yield prediction and sustainable resource management. It uses a synergistic approach, employing both a Markov Chain Model and a cellular automata model.

The spatio-temporal land use and land cover changes study maps and monitors changes and their relationship with normalized satellite indices and driving factors.

However, none of these studies provide information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository.
