Answer: The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is inferred from the information that the model is based on the EfficientNet B0 architecture, which is a type of CNN. Additionally, it is mentioned that the model learns to discriminate spectro-temporal information directly from a labeled spectrogram, which is a common practice when using CNNs in the field of marine bioacoustics. The authors also mention that they fine-tune the parameters of the fully connected layers, which is another indicator of using a CNN since these layers are typically used in CNNs for classification tasks. Therefore, based on the provided context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN.
