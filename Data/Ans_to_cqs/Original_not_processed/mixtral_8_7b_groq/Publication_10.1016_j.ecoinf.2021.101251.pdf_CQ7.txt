The provided context does not include information about the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. The text discusses data management and accessibility in the Earth and Environmental Sciences Data Information System (ESS-DIVE), including data submission, integration, and citation. It also mentions challenges in defining authorship, unifying data usage policies, and citing large numbers of data packages in research publications. However, it does not provide specifics on data splitting for model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an informed answer to this query.
