The provided context does not contain information about the use of deep learning models, nor does it mention which platform was used to deploy such models, if they were used at all. The text focuses on the use of statistical models and historical geospatial data for synthesizing information about different sites.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context. I can only state that the context does not provide information on the deep learning model deployment platform.
