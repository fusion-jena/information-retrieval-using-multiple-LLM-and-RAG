Answer:::
The text provided discusses the use of two metrics to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models: accuracy reduction and classification error.

Accuracy reduction is used to compare the performance of the models in predicting images from a target dataset, based on the accuracy obtained from a source dataset. Specifically, it measures the average reduction in accuracy between the within-dataset prediction accuracy (i.e., when the model is trained and tested on the same dataset) and the between-datasets prediction accuracy (i.e., when the model is trained on a source dataset and tested on a target dataset). Higher accuracy reduction indicates a worse performance on prediction compared to the within-dataset prediction accuracy.

Classification error, on the other hand, is used to evaluate the performance of the models in classifying images into their respective taxonomic groups. It is visualized as a scaled confusion matrix, which shows the number of correct and incorrect classifications made by the model. The text mentions that the large taxonomic groups were correctly classified in most cases, indicating a low classification error.

However, the text does not explicitly mention the use of other metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model, while recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances in the data. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and provides a balanced measure of the model's performance.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models are accuracy reduction and classification error. Other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score are not mentioned.
