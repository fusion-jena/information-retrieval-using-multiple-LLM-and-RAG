Based on the provided context, there is no information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context focuses on the comparison of four models (Gaussian, spherical, exponential, and linear) used for analyzing four lands based on scaled semi-variance data. The evaluation of these models is done using the MAE, MSE, and R2 metrics.

The metrics used for evaluation are as follows:

1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Represents the total of the residuals, providing a low error indication but not revealing the amplitude of the error.
2. Mean Squared Error (MSE): Provides a more precise point-by-point estimate, as squaring the variance at any point reveals the magnitude.
3. Coefficient of Determination (R2): Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

The context table provides RMSE and R2 values for the four models and different lands. However, it does not mention any details about the deep learning model's hyperparameters.

Answer:::
The provided context does not include information on the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer.
