The text provided does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for the models mentioned. However, it is mentioned that ImageNet, a large-scale hierarchical image database, is used for training some of the models (Deng et al., 2009). ImageNet is a publicly available dataset, which suggests that publicly available datasets can be used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines.

Additionally, the use of sensors as a method for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines is not explicitly mentioned in the text. However, the text does mention ResNet-101, Wide-ResNet-101, InceptionV3, and MnasNet-A1, which are all convolutional neural networks (CNNs) designed for image classification tasks. CNNs typically use images as input data, which can be collected using sensors such as cameras.

Furthermore, the text mentions data augmentation as a technique used to improve the performance of deep learning models (Hernández-García & König, 2018). Data augmentation involves creating new training examples by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to existing data. This suggests that the raw data used for training the models is likely modified and expanded using data augmentation techniques.

In summary, while the text does not provide explicit details about the methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines, it can be inferred that publicly available datasets and sensors such as cameras can be used for collecting raw data. Additionally, data augmentation techniques are used to modify and expand the raw data used for training deep learning models.
