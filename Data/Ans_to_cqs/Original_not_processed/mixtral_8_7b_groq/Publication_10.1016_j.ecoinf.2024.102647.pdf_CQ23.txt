Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some implicit indications that might suggest some steps were taken towards this goal.

Firstly, the performance of machine learning models was evaluated using four criteria: coefficient of determination (R2), NSE (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970), KGE (Gupta et al., 2009), and correlation coefficient (COR) (Sardoei et al., 2024). The use of multiple evaluation metrics can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's performance and help identify potential issues related to overfitting or underfitting.

Secondly, in the context of feature selection, the authors mention the limitations imposed by data scarcity and their commitment to maximizing the use of available well data. This suggests that they were aware of the importance of having a diverse dataset to train their model. A diverse dataset can help improve the model's generalizability by exposing it to a wide range of input variations.

However, there is no explicit mention of techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or data augmentation, which are commonly used to improve the generalizability of deep learning models. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on different subsets, and evaluating its performance on the remaining portions. This process helps reduce overfitting and provides a more reliable estimation of the model's performance on unseen data. Stratified splitting ensures that the distribution of classes remains similar in both training and testing sets, which can be particularly important when dealing with imbalanced datasets. Data augmentation techniques, like rotation, scaling, or flipping, can artificially increase the size of the dataset and further improve the model's ability to generalize.

In conclusion, while the provided context implies some efforts towards ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model, there is no explicit mention of techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or data augmentation. Therefore, it is not possible to definitively answer this question without additional information.
