Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of transfer learning in the process of model training for leaf classification, but it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the dataset used for training the model consists of labeled images, as the authors mention dividing the dataset into a training set and a test set.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Image classification: This involves labeling an image with a single class or category.
2. Bounding box annotation: This involves drawing a box around an object within an image and labeling the object.
3. Semantic segmentation: This involves dividing an image into multiple segments or regions, each of which is assigned a specific label or class.
4. Instance segmentation: This is a more advanced form of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object within an image is assigned a unique label or class.

Based on the context provided, it can be inferred that the data annotation technique used in this case is image classification, where each leaf image is labeled with a specific class. However, the specific technique used for data annotation is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
