Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning models mentioned in the provided context is image classification. This is evident in the layer structures of the unstained/stained CNN and the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN, as described in Tables 1 and 2. Both models follow a typical structure for image classification tasks, which includes ConvolutionLayer, BatchNormalizationLayer, Ramp (ReLU), and PoolingLayer for feature extraction, followed by FlattenLayer, DropoutLayer for regularization, and LinearLayer for final classification. The input to both models is a 3-tensor, representing a color image, and the output is a vector that is passed through a SoftmaxLayer to produce a class probability distribution.

The unstained/stained CNN is designed to classify images as either stained or unstained, as indicated by Supplementary Materials 1 and 2. Similarly, the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN is used to classify images as either clubmoss or spikemoss, as described in Supplementary Materials 3 and 4.

In summary, the deep learning models discussed in the context are designed for image classification tasks, specifically for distinguishing between stained and unstained images in one case, and between clubmoss and spikemoss images in the other.
