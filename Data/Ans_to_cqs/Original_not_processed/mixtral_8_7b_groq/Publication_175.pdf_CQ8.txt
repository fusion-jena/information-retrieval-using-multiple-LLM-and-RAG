Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the studies. The context mainly focuses on the use of deep learning models for various tasks such as fish species classification in underwater environments, automated detection of marine mammal species, and few-shot learning. However, it does not mention where the code for these models is hosted. It is possible that the code may be available upon request from the authors of the studies or through their institutional repositories.
