Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline for land monitoring using satellite imagery involves processing and classifying data based on phenological characteristics (PCF). According to the provided context, the format of the data used in this pipeline is satellite imagery.

In the labeling part of the pipeline, a labeling methodology is determined for training the deep learning model. The format of the labeling methodology is based on the spatial resolution and spectral band used, interval in PSI, and chronological order of each band. The target PSI, which has the same format as the trained PSI, can be classified using the trained model.

When satellite imagery accumulates over time due to continuous satellite observations, the PSI can be continuously generated, and classification can be continued using the model. This enables PCF land monitoring.

Therefore, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline for land monitoring using satellite imagery is satellite imagery, which is processed and classified based on the PCF.
