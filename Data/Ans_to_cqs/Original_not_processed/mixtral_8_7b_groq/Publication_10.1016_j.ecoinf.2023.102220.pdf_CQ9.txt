Answer:::
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context contains details about the comparison of the PBP method with other machine learning methods, including Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) methods. However, it does not mention where the data or code for these methods is stored or made available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query. I recommend checking the original research article or the pypbp package documentation for more information on the data repository.
