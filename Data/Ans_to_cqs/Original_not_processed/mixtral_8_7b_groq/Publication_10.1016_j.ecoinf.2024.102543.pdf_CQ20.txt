Answer:::
The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that parameters and FLOPs (Floating Point Operations Per Second) are considered to evaluate the model. These metrics are related to the computational complexity of the model. Therefore, it can be inferred that powerful computational hardware, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), are likely used for training, as they can handle the large number of calculations required by deep learning models more efficiently than CPUs.
