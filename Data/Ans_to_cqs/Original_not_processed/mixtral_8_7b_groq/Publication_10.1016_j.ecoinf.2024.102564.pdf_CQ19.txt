Answer:::

The provided context discusses two machine learning methods, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Random Forests (RF), used for modeling net growth in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. However, the context does not mention any specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on neural networks with many layers (hence "deep"). The context describes ANNs, which are computational models inspired by the human brain and can be considered a type of neural network. However, the context does not specify whether these ANNs have multiple layers that would classify them as "deep" learning models.

Furthermore, the context focuses on the configuration of RF parameters and does not mention any deep learning frameworks.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which deep learning frameworks, if any, were used to build the model.
