Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does mention that the vessel data used in the study are obtained from Global Fishing Watch (GFW), which provides global-scale data for the 2012-2016 period only. The data is already classified through a machine learning model and is distributed at a resolution of 0.01 with fishing activity cells.

The study's workflow implements a FAIR approach, which stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. The data is made available through the DataMiner Cloud computing platform of the D4Science e-Infrastructure, which allows accessing the knowledge sources on-the-fly during processing. The geospatial data is offered as standardized NetCDF files available on a distributed ISO/OGC compliant Spatial Data Infrastructure.

The study mentions that the precision of the workflow's output depends on the completeness of the input vessel data, the update rate of the GRSF, the completeness of the OBIS data in the selected time range, and the suitability of the selected spatial resolution for the analysis. The study has demonstrated that the workflow can compensate for some biases through data classification and spatio-temporal aggregation, mainly when large input datasets are used.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it does provide insights into the data sources, data processing, and data availability, which are crucial for developing and training deep learning models.
