Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that all images were resized to the same resolution (227Ã—197 pixels) and normalized to the [0,1] range. This is a common preprocessing step to ensure that the deep learning models receive standardized input data.

As for addressing data bias, the context does mention that six open-source Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were selected for model optimization, and an early stop approach was implemented to prevent overfitting. However, these techniques do not directly address data bias.

Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot determine if any techniques to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection, were used during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
