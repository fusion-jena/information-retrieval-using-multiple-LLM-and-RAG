Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, as well as the generation of a confusion matrix.

In the study conducted by Alana K. Neves et al., the model training involved a semantic segmentation approach for the classification of Cerrado physiognomies using remote sensing data. After the training process, the model's performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix, which is a table that summarizes the number of correct and incorrect predictions made by the model. The confusion matrix was used to calculate precision, recall, and F1-score for each class (grassland, savanna, and forest) at the first level of classification.

However, the context does not mention any specific steps such as the generation of saliency maps or other visualization techniques.

It is worth noting that postprocessing steps can vary depending on the specific model and application. In some cases, additional steps such as feature importance analysis, error analysis, or hyperparameter tuning may be performed.

Therefore, while the context provides specific details on the postprocessing steps used in this particular study, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of all possible postprocessing steps that could be involved after model training.
