The provided context does not give specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study focuses on water sun glint detection in UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) water images. Given that this is a semantic segmentation task, it can be inferred that some form of pixel-level annotation was used.

Semantic segmentation is the process of dividing an image into multiple segments or regions, with each region representing a specific class or object. In the context of water sun glint detection, pixel-level annotation would involve labeling each pixel in an image as either 'water sun glint' or 'non-water sun glint'. This is different from bounding box annotation, where bounding boxes are drawn around objects of interest, or instance segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and assigned a unique identifier.

The paper mentions the use of the UNet architecture, which is a popular convolutional neural network (CNN) for biomedical image segmentation. UNet was designed specifically for pixel-level image segmentation and consists of a contracting path for feature extraction and a symmetric expanding path for precise localization. The contracting path captures context, while the expanding path enables precise localization using transposed convolutions and skip connections.

In summary, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that pixel-level annotation was used for water sun glint detection in UAV water images. However, the specific data annotation techniques are not mentioned in the text.
