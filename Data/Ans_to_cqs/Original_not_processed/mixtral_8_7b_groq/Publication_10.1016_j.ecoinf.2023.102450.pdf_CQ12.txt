Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the Siamese relation network (Cheng et al., 2021) is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the backbone of the Siamese relation network is a deep residual neural network (ResNet-50), which is a type of CNN. This CNN architecture is used to extract multi-scale features from images of animals. Additionally, a cascade structure of a region-based convolutional neural network is employed to classify the proposed location boxes. Therefore, the Siamese relation network primarily uses CNNs in its pipeline for image feature extraction and classification.
