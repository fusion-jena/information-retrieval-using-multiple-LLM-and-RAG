Answer:::

Based on the information provided, there is no direct link to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline in AutoGluon. However, AutoGluon is an open-source library, and its code is publicly available on GitHub. You can access the code, contribute to it, or use it in your projects. Here is the link to the GitHub repository of AutoGluon:

<https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon>

The repository contains the code for the AutoGluon library, including the deep learning pipeline. You can find the implementation details of the pipeline in the source code, and you can also use the library to create your deep learning pipelines.

It is worth noting that AutoGluon is not only a deep learning library but also an automated machine learning (AutoML) library. It automates various tasks in the machine learning workflow, including data pre-processing, algorithm selection, and hyperparameter tuning. The deep learning pipeline in AutoGluon is part of this larger AutoML framework.

In summary, while there is no direct link to the code repository of the deep learning pipeline in AutoGluon, the code for the library, including the deep learning pipeline, is publicly available on GitHub. You can access the code at the following link:
