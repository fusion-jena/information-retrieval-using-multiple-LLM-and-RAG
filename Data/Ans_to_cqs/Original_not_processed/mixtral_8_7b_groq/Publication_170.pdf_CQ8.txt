Unfortunately, the context provided does not include information about the availability of a code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text describes the methodology, results, and comparisons to other studies, but it does not mention where the code for the pipeline can be found. It is possible that the authors have not made the code publicly available, or it may be hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. If you are interested in the code, it may be worth reaching out to the authors directly to inquire about its availability.
