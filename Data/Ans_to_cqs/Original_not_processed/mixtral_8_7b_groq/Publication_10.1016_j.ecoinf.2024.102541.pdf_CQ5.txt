Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipelines of the mentioned studies. However, it does mention some well-known datasets in the computer vision community.

In the context of the YOLOv5s model, the authors use the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset for training and evaluation. The COCO dataset is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset, which contains 330,000 images with 1.5 million object instances and 80 categories. The dataset is often used for training and benchmarking deep learning models for object detection and segmentation tasks.

Additionally, the context refers to the Mosaic data enhancement technique, which is used during the data preprocessing phase. Mosaic data augmentation combines four images into one for training, creating a more diverse and challenging dataset. Although Mosaic data augmentation does not define a specific dataset, it can be applied to any dataset during the data preprocessing phase.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly list the datasets used in the deep learning pipelines, it does mention the COCO dataset and the Mosaic data augmentation technique, which are commonly used in the field of computer vision.
