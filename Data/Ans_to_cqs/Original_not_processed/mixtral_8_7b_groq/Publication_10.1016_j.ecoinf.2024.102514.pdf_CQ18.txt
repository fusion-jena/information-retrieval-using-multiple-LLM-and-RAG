Answer:

In the study conducted by Sajib et al. (2024), the model performance during training was monitored using the root mean square deviation (RMSD) and mean absolute error (MAE) metrics. The WQ indicator data was divided into training and testing datasets, with 80% and 20% ratios, respectively. A total of 20 random sample locations were selected for the training dataset, and 10 for the testing dataset.

During the training period, the majority of performance indicators were found to be higher, indicating that the models were performing relatively well in predicting the WQ indicator values based on the training dataset. However, the study found that the model performance greatly improved during the testing period, suggesting that some models may have been overfitting to the training data.

To address the overfitting problem, the study examined the RMSE and MAE for the eight machine learning (ML) algorithms, including GPR, LR, NN, SLR, SVM, TR, XGB, and MLR. The results showed that the lowest prediction errors during the training and testing periods belonged to GPR, LR, NN, and SVM. This suggests that these models were able to generalize well to the testing dataset, indicating good performance during training.

Furthermore, the study also addressed the monitoring of model performance during training by adopting a data splitting strategy. The WQ indicator data was divided into training and testing datasets, and the training dataset was further divided into sub-training and validation datasets. This allowed for the monitoring of model performance during training by comparing the predictions made on the validation dataset to the actual values.

In summary, the study implemented a monitoring strategy for the model performance during training by using RMSD and MAE metrics, examining the prediction errors during the training and testing periods, and adopting a data splitting strategy. These strategies allowed for the identification of overfitting models and the selection of models that generalized well to the testing dataset.
