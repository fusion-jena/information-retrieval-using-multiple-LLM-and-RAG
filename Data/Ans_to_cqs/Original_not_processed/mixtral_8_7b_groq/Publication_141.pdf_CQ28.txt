Answer:::
The provided context does not give information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that the Keras library and TensorFlow with GPU execution were used as the back-end engine for implementing the CNN classifier in the Python programming language. Therefore, I cannot determine whether the model was deployed on AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or another platform.
