Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are no explicit mentions of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling that were applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the GoogLeNet architecture was used, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that won the ImageNet competition in 2015. GoogLeNet is composed of 22 layers and uses inception modules, which allow the network to use convolutions of different sizes and weight each of these convolutions. This network can account more or less strongly for the context of each pixel, increasing the range of possibilities to improve its performance during training.

Additionally, it is mentioned that at least 2200 thumbnails per fish species class were used, and batches of 240 images were processed during training. However, these do not necessarily imply data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, while data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, the provided context does not explicitly mention any such techniques being applied in this particular case.
