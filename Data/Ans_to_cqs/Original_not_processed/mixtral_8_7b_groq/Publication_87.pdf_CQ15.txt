Answer:::

The PyTorch deep learning library is used in the described deep learning pipeline, but the specific optimization techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the given text. However, based on the code snippet provided, it can be inferred that the Adam optimization algorithm is used. This is because the 'cnn_learner' function from the 'fastai' library is called, and by default, it uses the Adam optimizer.

In the code snippet, the 'cnn_learner' function is defined with the 'arch' parameter set to 'resnet18', which is a pre-defined convolutional neural network architecture in PyTorch. The 'fastai' library, which is built on PyTorch, provides this 'cnn_learner' function to simplify the process of creating a deep learning model. The 'fastai' library typically uses the Adam optimization algorithm as the default optimizer for 'cnn_learner' function.
