Answer:::

In evaluating the performance of deep learning models, several metrics can be used, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Accuracy is the most intuitive performance measure and is simply a ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations. However, accuracy alone may not be sufficient to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, especially when the classes are imbalanced.

Precision, on the other hand, measures the proportion of true positive predictions (relevant instances) among all positive predictions. It is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives. Precision is useful when the cost of false positives is high.

Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances. It is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives. Recall is useful when the cost of false negatives is high.

The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a single metric that encapsulates both. It is calculated as twice the product of precision and recall divided by the sum of precision and recall. The F1 score is a better metric than accuracy when dealing with imbalanced classes.

In addition to these metrics, other performance measures such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination (R-squared) can be used for regression problems, while area under the curve (AUC-ROC) and log loss can be used for classification problems.

It is important to note that the choice of performance metric depends on the specific problem and the business context. For instance, in medical diagnosis, false negatives may have more severe consequences than false positives, and therefore, recall may be a more appropriate metric than precision.

In the context of the provided articles, Kovalev et al. (2016) compared the speed and accuracy of five deep learning frameworks, including Theano, Torch, Caffe, Tensorflow, and deeplearning4j. While they mentioned accuracy as a performance metric, they did not explicitly mention precision, recall, or F1 score. LeCun et al. (2015) provided a comprehensive overview of deep learning and its applications, but they did not discuss performance metrics in detail. Goodwin et al. (2020) leveraged machine learning to advance the study of aggression ethology, but they did not mention the specific performance metrics used.
