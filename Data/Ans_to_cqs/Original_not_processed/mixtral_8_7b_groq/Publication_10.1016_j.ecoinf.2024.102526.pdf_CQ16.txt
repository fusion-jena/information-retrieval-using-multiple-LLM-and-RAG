Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for a machine learning model. However, there are some related details that can be used to infer possible criteria.

In the context, there is a mention of "validation loss plateau" which suggests that monitoring the loss function during training could be a criterion for determining training completion. Specifically, if the validation loss stops decreasing or reaches a low enough value and stays there for a certain number of epochs, the training process could be considered complete. This is a common practice in machine learning to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model has learned general patterns in the data.

However, there are other possible criteria that are not mentioned in the context. For example, training could be stopped based on the performance on a separate test set, or based on the elapsed time or computational resources used. These criteria may be more appropriate depending on the specific problem and resources available.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific criteria for determining training completion, it suggests that monitoring the validation loss and looking for a plateau could be one possible approach. Other criteria such as test set performance or resource constraints may also be considered.
