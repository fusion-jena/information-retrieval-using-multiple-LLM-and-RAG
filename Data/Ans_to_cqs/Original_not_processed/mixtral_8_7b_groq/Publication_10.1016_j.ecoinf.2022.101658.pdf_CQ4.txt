Answer:::
The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include horizontal flipping, adding Gaussian noise, and reducing contrast. These strategies were used to increase the size of the training set fourfold, as the original set of 290 training images was found to be insufficient for satisfactory results in the multi-class semantic segmentation problem. The horizontal flip technique is a common augmentation method that generates new images by flipping the original images along the horizontal axis. Adding Gaussian noise introduces random variations in the pixel intensities, simulating natural image variations. The contrast reduction strategy specifically aims to help simulate areas of low lighting, which can be expected in the dataset due to the presence of shadows occluding the vegetation types. This strategy is motivated by the application's expectation of images containing shadows. These data augmentation techniques were chosen to improve the deep learning model's performance by increasing the training set size and simulating real-world variations in the images.
