Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct information given about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Zhang et al., 2023. The study focuses on a deep learning-based data-driven model for detecting time-delay water quality indicators of wastewater treatment plant influent. However, it does not mention where the data and code for the pipeline are stored or shared.

However, the study does mention the use of machine learning methods, specifically random forest models, for a wide range of contexts, including remote sensing. The study by Zheng and Jia, 2022, also uses remote sensing observations for evaluating different methods for soil heat flux estimation at large scales. While these studies do not provide a data repository link for their deep learning or machine learning pipelines, they demonstrate the potential of using such methods for environmental and ecological applications.

In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of data sharing and reproducibility in scientific research, including machine learning and deep learning studies. Researchers are encouraged to share their data and code in public repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF to promote transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration.

Therefore, while there is no direct answer to the query regarding the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Zhang et al., 2023, it is recommended to check the authors' affiliations or contact them directly to inquire about the availability of the data and code. Additionally, researchers are encouraged to share their data and code in public repositories to promote open science and reproducibility.
