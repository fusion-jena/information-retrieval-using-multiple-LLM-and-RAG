Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix calculation after the model training. However, it is mentioned that the model's performance was assessed using certain metrics.

After training the model with the Xception backbone and attention-based mechanisms, the model's performance was evaluated using the mean reciprocal rank (MRR), accuracy (ACC), and hierarchical distance of a mistake (HDM) as metrics. The MRR was used to assess the quality of a list of potential responses to a sample of queries, while accuracy determined the proportion of correctly classified items. The HDM quantified the degree of misclassification when only a single class could be predicted. An average accuracy across all class hierarchies (avg_ACC) was also calculated to evaluate the efficacy of the hierarchical classification.

Moreover, subsequent tests were conducted to evaluate the impact of removing certain attention mechanisms from the model. These tests resulted in a decrease in classification accuracy and highlighted the importance of strategic integration of various attention mechanisms for enhancing key feature extraction and improving the discriminability of different feature categories.

Lastly, the effectiveness of the proposed path correction strategy was evaluated, but the context does not provide specific details about how this evaluation was carried out.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention postprocessing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrix calculation, it does mention that the model's performance was evaluated using specific metrics such as MRR, accuracy, and HDM.
