Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the training data was diversified and that segments of audio recordings containing the target signal were extracted using a simple detector based on signal strength.

The context also mentions the use of data augmentation, which is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by creating new samples from existing ones. In this case, a 3-second window length was used to implement this data augmentation method.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning can include:

1. Image annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation, where rectangular boxes are drawn around objects of interest in an image, and instance segmentation, where individual objects are segmented and labeled in an image.
2. Text annotation techniques such as named entity recognition, where entities such as people, organizations, and locations are identified and labeled in text data.
3. Audio annotation techniques such as segment-level annotation, where segments of audio recordings are annotated with labels indicating the presence or absence of a target sound.

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that segment-level annotation was used for audio data in this deep learning pipeline. However, more specific information about the data annotation techniques used is not provided.
