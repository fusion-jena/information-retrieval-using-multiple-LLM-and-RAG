The text provided does not give specific information about the deep learning framework used to build the model. However, it mentions several components and techniques that are commonly used in deep learning models for image processing and semantic segmentation, such as Atrous convolutions, spatial pyramid pooling, ResNet, Xception, and connected component analysis.

It is possible that the authors used a popular deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch to implement these techniques. For instance, TensorFlow provides a range of tools and libraries for building and training convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including pre-built models for semantic segmentation such as DeepLab. Similarly, PyTorch has a large ecosystem of packages and libraries for building and training deep learning models, including support for CNNs and semantic segmentation.

Therefore, while the text does not explicitly state which framework was used, it is likely that the authors used a popular deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch to build the model.
