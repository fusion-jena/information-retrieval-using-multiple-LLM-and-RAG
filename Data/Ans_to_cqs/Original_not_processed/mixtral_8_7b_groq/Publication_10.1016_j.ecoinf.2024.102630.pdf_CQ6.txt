Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention some data curation and processing that was done for the study.

The study used several NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) datasets, including MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI, CDR AVHRR NDVI V5, GIMMS NDVI, and SPOT NDVI. These datasets were obtained from the Google Earth Engine platform and the Resource and Environmental Data Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The data used in the study underwent some processing, such as selecting specific time periods for the annual mean NDVI data, growing season mean NDVI data, spring mean NDVI data, summer mean NDVI data, and winter mean NDVI data.

Additionally, the study had multiple authors who contributed to different aspects of the research, including methodology, visualization, conceptualization, software, formal analysis, data curation, and writing.

Therefore, it is possible that some preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning were performed as part of the data curation and preparation process. However, the specific details of these steps are not provided in the context.
