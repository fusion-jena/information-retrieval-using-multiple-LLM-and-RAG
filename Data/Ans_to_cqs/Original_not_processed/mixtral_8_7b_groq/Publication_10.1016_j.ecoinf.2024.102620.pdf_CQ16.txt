The pieces of context provided do not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the PLUS model. However, they do give some insight into the evaluation metrics used for the model's performance. These metrics include the Pearson correlation coefficient (R), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

In the context, the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) is used to evaluate the correlation between predicted and actual values, with a higher value indicating a stronger correlation. This coefficient ranges from 0 to 1. The RMSE is used to assess the credibility of predicted values, with an RMSE of <0.1 indicating high accuracy. MAPE is another statistical measure used to evaluate the accuracy of predictions by comparing predicted and actual values, with MAPE values below 0.1 indicating excellent prediction accuracy.

While these metrics are used for evaluating the model's performance, they do not directly answer the query about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Typically, in machine learning models, training is stopped when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly, or when the model starts to overfit. However, the provided context does not mention any specific criteria for the PLUS model.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
