Answer:::

Deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), often require preprocessing of the input data to improve model performance and convergence during training. However, the specific preprocessing steps are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I will provide a general overview of common preprocessing techniques used in deep learning.

1. Data cleaning: This step involves removing irrelevant or corrupted data points from the dataset. For images, this might include removing images with low resolution, incorrect labels, or poor contrast.

2. Data augmentation: This technique is used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing images. Common transformations include rotation, scaling, flipping, and cropping. Data augmentation can help improve the model's ability to generalize and reduce overfitting.

3. Normalization: Normalization is the process of scaling the input data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1. This is important for deep learning models because it can help improve convergence during training and reduce the impact of outlier data points. In the context of images, normalization is typically applied to each pixel value.

4. Resizing: Deep learning models often require a fixed input size. Therefore, it is necessary to resize images to a consistent size before training. This step should be done carefully, as resizing can impact the aspect ratio and details of the image.

5. Grayscale conversion: For some applications, converting color images to grayscale can help reduce the complexity of the model and improve training time. However, this step is not always necessary, as color information can be important for certain tasks.

In the provided context, it is mentioned that different preprocessing and augmentation techniques were applied to improve the performance of the deep learning models. However, the specific techniques are not specified. It can be inferred that the authors applied data augmentation techniques, as they trained multiple models with different input resolutions. Additionally, normalization might have been applied, as it is a common preprocessing step for deep learning models.

In summary, while the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned in the provided context, common preprocessing techniques for deep learning models include data cleaning, data augmentation, normalization, resizing, and grayscale conversion. These steps can help improve model performance, convergence, and generalization.
