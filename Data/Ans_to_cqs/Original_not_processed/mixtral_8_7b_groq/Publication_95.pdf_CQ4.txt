The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include randomly flipping images horizontally, scaling the contrast of each image channel, and randomly cropping the images to a square shape. 

Firstly, the images are randomly flipped horizontally. This technique helps in increasing the diversity of the training data by creating a mirror image of the original image. It also helps the model to generalize better and reduce overfitting.

Secondly, the contrast of each image channel is scaled by a random factor between 0.8 and 1.2. This technique is used to adjust the brightness of the image, which can help the model to learn better color and texture features. It also helps in improving the model's robustness to changes in lighting conditions.

Lastly, the images are randomly cropped to a square shape with side lengths equal to the image height. This technique helps in increasing the training data by creating new images from the existing ones. It also helps the model to learn spatial features better, as it gets trained on different parts of the image.

These data augmentation techniques are applied during training before the images are processed by the network. The purpose of data augmentation is to increase the diversity of the training data, reduce overfitting, and improve the model's ability to generalize to new images.

It is worth noting that no rotation or other geometric transformations were mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, it can be inferred that these techniques were not applied in the deep learning pipeline.
