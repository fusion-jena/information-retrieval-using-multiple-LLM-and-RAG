Answer:::
In the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the training process is interrupted after a fixed number of epochs (2 epochs in the example provided), and the model is saved for later use.

In general, training of machine learning models is often stopped when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model is starting to overfit to the training data. This is a common practice to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model. However, in the provided context, this specific criterion is not mentioned.

It is also worth noting that the training process can be influenced by various factors such as the learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs. In the provided context, the learning rate and batch size are not explicitly mentioned, but the number of epochs is set to 2.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, it is common practice to stop training when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase. However, in this case, the training is interrupted after a fixed number of epochs.
