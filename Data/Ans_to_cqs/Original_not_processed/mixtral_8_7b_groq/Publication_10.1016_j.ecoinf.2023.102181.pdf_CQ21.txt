Based on the provided context, there are several postprocessing steps mentioned after the model training, although they are not specifically named as "Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, Confusion matrix." Here are the relevant postprocessing steps:

1. **Obtaining unbiased estimates of model performance:** After training the model using covariance-weighted bagging, the next step is to evaluate its performance accurately. This involves predicting the value of the response across the full extent of the study area and comparing it to the response raster surface to measure the true validation statistics, such as Validation Error (VE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

2. **Calculation of residuals:** After predicting the response variable across the study area, the residuals are calculated by subtracting the predicted values from the actual values. These residuals are used to assess the model's performance.

3. **Spatial autocorrelation information for model prediction:** The provided context suggests that leveraging spatial autocorrelation information can improve model prediction. However, the specific method to achieve this is not mentioned.

4. **Automatic variable selection and regularization behavior of the bagging model:** The text hints at observing the behavior of the bagging model in terms of variable selection and regularization. This could provide insights into the model's ability to handle irrelevant or redundant features.

5. **Semivariogram analysis:** After predicting the response variable, a semivariogram analysis is performed to understand the spatial structure of the residuals. This involves generating an empirical semivariogram, fitting a semivariogram model, and simulating Gaussian random fields to assess the accuracy of the model's predictions.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix, it does discuss several postprocessing steps, including performance evaluation, residual calculation, spatial autocorrelation, variable selection/regularization, and semivariogram analysis.
