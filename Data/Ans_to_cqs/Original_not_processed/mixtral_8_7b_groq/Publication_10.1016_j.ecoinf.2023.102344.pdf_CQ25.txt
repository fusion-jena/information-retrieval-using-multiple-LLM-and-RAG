The purpose of the deep learning model, as described in the provided context, is for image-based tasks, specifically for outputting numerical features from images that are suitable for the target output. This is achieved through the use of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which are trained on large image datasets.

The deep learning model mentioned in the context is a Hybrid Deep Neural Network, which utilizes a bottleneck architecture and shortcut connections to improve training efficiency and accuracy. The bottleneck architecture consists of a 1 × 1 convolutional layer for dimension reduction, a 3 × 3 convolution layer for feature extraction, and another 1 × 1 convolutional layer for dimension restoration. These layers allow for the extraction of relevant features from the input images while reducing the computational complexity of the model.

Shortcut connections, also known as skip connections, allow gradients to flow directly through the network by adding the input directly to the output. This helps to mitigate the problem of vanishing gradients, which can occur in deep neural networks, and results in a more stable and efficient training process.

Additionally, the model utilizes global average pooling (GAP) which computes the spatial average of the feature maps at the end section of the convolutional layer. This further reduces the complexity of the model and helps to prevent overfitting.

The Hybrid Deep Neural Network model is compared to InceptionV3, a 48-layer 24 CNN containing 24 × 106 parameters, which utilizes label smoothing and factorized convolutional layers for efficient information propagation from input to output.

In summary, the purpose of the deep learning model described in the context is for image-based tasks, specifically for outputting numerical features from images that are suitable for the target output. The model utilizes a bottleneck architecture, shortcut connections, and global average pooling to improve training efficiency and accuracy.
