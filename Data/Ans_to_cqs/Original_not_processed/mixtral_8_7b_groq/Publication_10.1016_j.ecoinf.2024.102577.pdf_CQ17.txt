Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some information about regularization techniques that are commonly used in machine learning, which could be applied in the deep learning pipeline.

Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models by adding a penalty term to the loss function. This penalty term discourages the learning algorithm from assigning too much importance to any single feature, thereby reducing the complexity of the model and improving its generalization performance.

Two common regularization techniques are L1 and L2 regularization. L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the model coefficients. This has the effect of shrinking some of the coefficients to zero, effectively eliminating the corresponding features from the model. L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the model coefficients. This has the effect of shrinking all of the coefficients towards zero, but none of them are eliminated entirely.

Another regularization technique that is commonly used in deep learning is dropout. Dropout is a regularization method that randomly sets a fraction of the hidden units in a neural network to zero during training. This has the effect of preventing the network from relying too heavily on any single hidden unit, thereby reducing overfitting and improving generalization performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not specifically mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, L1 and L2 regularization and dropout are commonly used regularization techniques in machine learning and deep learning that could be applied to prevent overfitting.
