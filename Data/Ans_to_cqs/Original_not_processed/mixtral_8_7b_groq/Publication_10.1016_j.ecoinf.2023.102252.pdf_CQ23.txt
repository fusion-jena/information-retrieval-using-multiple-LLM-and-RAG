Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The text focuses on the description of the model's equations and ecological application, but it does not mention any steps taken for model validation such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

However, it is mentioned that the model has limitations and future work will be done to improve it (Section 6). It is possible that the generalizability of the model was addressed in the future work or in the original sources that were cited.

In summary, based on the provided context, there is no clear information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
