Answer:::

The provided context discusses the differences between deep learning models and XGBoost, particularly in the context of processing structured and unstructured data like images and text. However, it does not directly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Nevertheless, based on general knowledge, deep learning models often use large datasets for training, which can be obtained from various sources such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets.

Surveys can provide structured data in the form of questionnaire responses, which can be used to train deep learning models for tasks like sentiment analysis or prediction. Sensors, on the other hand, can generate unstructured data in the form of images, audio, or other sensor readings. For instance, in the context of remote sensing, instruments like the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartography (SCIAMACHY), Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2), Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT), and Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) can generate large volumes of spectral data that can be used to train deep learning models for tasks like vegetation index extraction or atmospheric gas concentration estimation.

Public datasets are another important source of raw data for deep learning models. These datasets can be obtained from repositories like UCI Machine Learning Repository, Kaggle, or Google Dataset Search. Public datasets can contain a wide variety of data types, including images, text, audio, and sensor readings, and can be used for a wide variety of tasks, from image recognition to natural language processing.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it is mentioned that deep learning models typically require large datasets for training. These datasets can be obtained from various sources, including surveys, sensors, and public datasets.
