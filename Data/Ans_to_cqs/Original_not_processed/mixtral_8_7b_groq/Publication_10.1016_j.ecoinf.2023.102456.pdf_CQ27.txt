Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer some steps that might have been taken based on the common practices in deep learning model deployment.

Firstly, after training the model, it is common to serialize the model, which involves saving the model architecture and learned parameters to a file. Model serialization allows the trained model to be stored and loaded later for making predictions on new data. The context does not mention any specific tool or library used for model serialization, but popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch provide built-in functions for model serialization.

Secondly, platform selection is an essential step in deep learning model deployment. The context does not provide information about the platform used for deployment, but it mentions that the model is designed to learn the neighborhood relationships in a system. Therefore, the platform selected should be capable of handling complex computations and data processing required for learning the neighborhood relationships.

Thirdly, the context mentions the use of a neural network (ANN) or other objects as a part of the architecture to learn the neighborhood relationship Rk. Therefore, the platform selected should support the deployment of neural networks.

Finally, the context mentions the use of a backpropagation algorithm for training the model. Therefore, the platform selected should support the backpropagation algorithm and gradient computation required for training the model.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, we can infer that the process might have involved model serialization, platform selection, and deployment of neural networks with backpropagation algorithm support.
