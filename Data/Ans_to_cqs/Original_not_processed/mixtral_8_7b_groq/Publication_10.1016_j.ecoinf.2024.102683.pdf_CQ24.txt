The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does describe a data augmentation approach used in the FAA-based method for plant identification. This method involves dividing data into five folds and applying policies to augment each fold without repetition. While the context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value in this process, it is possible that one is employed to ensure the reproducibility of the data augmentation and model training process.

Additionally, the context discusses the use of a Bayesian optimizer to control the output of the CNN model for each fold. Bayesian optimization is a sequential design strategy for global optimization of black-box functions, and it can be used to tune hyperparameters in deep learning models. The use of Bayesian optimization may help to reduce the impact of randomness in the model training process by finding optimal hyperparameters that generalize well to new data.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of attention mechanisms to enhance the performance of deep learning models for plant identification. Attention mechanisms allow deep learning models to focus on relevant input elements, which can improve model performance and reduce the impact of randomness in the feature extraction process.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest the possible use of a random seed value in the data augmentation process and the use of Bayesian optimization and attention mechanisms to reduce the impact of randomness in model training and feature extraction.
