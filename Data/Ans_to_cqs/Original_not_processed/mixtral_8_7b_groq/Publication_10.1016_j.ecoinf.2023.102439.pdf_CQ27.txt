The provided context does not give detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were used to create a hybrid model for predicting vegetation biomass density.

The hybrid model was developed by combining wavelet analysis and the NARX ANN algorithm to enhance the performance of the NARX ANN model. The training values for this model were 96% for Iznik and 91% for Alanya. After improvement, the estimated percentages for all data increased to 95% for Iznik and 88% for Alanya.

The context also mentions that ANNs are frequently discussed in the literature and are successful in modeling studies. They learn from past and present data, uncover hidden relationships among the data, and utilize them to make predictions for future scenarios. ANNs have demonstrated their efficacy in simulating and estimating satellite data, yielding reliable results.

However, the process of model serialization, platform selection, or any other deployment steps are not provided in the context. Therefore, a precise answer to the query cannot be given based on the provided information.
