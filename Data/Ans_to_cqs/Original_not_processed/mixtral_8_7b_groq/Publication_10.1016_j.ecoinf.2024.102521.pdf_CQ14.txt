Answer:

The provided context does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized in the STARdbi system. It is mentioned that users can train models locally using the programs provided in the STARdbi website, but the methods for hyperparameter tuning are not specified.

However, it is common to use techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models. Grid search involves testing all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a specified range, while random search selects a subset of these combinations at random. Bayesian optimization, on the other hand, uses a probabilistic approach to select the most promising hyperparameters to test.

In the context of STARdbi, it is possible that the developers have implemented one or more of these methods for hyperparameter tuning in the programs they provide for training classification models. However, without further information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
