Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the NDVI data was resampled because its original spatial resolution of 1.875 was considered too coarse. Resampling data can be a way to address data bias by ensuring that the data has a consistent resolution and is representative of the study area.

Additionally, the data sources mentioned in the context include a diverse range of sources, such as Google Earth Engine, OpenStreetMap, and the National Centers for Environmental Information. Diverse data collection can help to reduce data bias by ensuring that the data comes from multiple sources and perspectives.

It is also mentioned that the study area has a spatial resolution of 500m and uses meteorological data from CMIP6. The use of high-resolution data and data from well-established sources can also help to reduce data bias.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, it is mentioned that the data was resampled, collected from diverse sources, and has a high spatial resolution. These methods can help to reduce data bias in the deep learning pipeline.
