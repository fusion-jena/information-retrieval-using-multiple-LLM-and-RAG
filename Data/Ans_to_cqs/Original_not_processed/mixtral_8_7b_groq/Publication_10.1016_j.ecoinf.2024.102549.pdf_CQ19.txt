The context provided does not give specific information about the deep learning framework used to build the model. However, it does mention that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is employed, and more specifically, the AlexNet architecture is used. Common deep learning frameworks used to build CNN models include TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. Therefore, based on the information given, it can be inferred that one of these popular deep learning frameworks was likely used to build the CNN model with the AlexNet architecture. But without explicit confirmation in the provided context, a definitive answer cannot be given.
