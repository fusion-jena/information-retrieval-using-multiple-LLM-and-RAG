Answer:::

The provided context discusses a deep learning pipeline used for Green View Index (GVI) extraction, specifically the SegFormer model trained on the UGE-D (Urban Green Extraction Dataset) dataset. However, it does not mention any standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet that are commonly used in deep learning research.

In the context, the authors highlight the lack of high-quality datasets for GVI extraction and propose the UGE-D dataset, which is designed for semantic segmentation tasks in urban scenarios. The authors compare UGE-D to other existing datasets, such as COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and AED20K, which are widely used for various semantic segmentation tasks.

Therefore, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context are UGE-D, COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and AED20K. These datasets are specifically designed for semantic segmentation tasks in urban scenarios, and they facilitate the learning of GVI models.
