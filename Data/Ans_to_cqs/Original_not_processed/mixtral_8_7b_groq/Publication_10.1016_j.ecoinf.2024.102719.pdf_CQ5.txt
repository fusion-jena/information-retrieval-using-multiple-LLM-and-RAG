Answer:::

The provided context does not include specific information about the datasets used in deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The context focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning models in river health predictions and ecosystem services, rather than discussing specific datasets used in these models.

In the river health prediction study, the authors mention the use of machine learning and deep learning models for predicting river health based on environmental factors, but they do not specify the datasets used for training and testing these models. Similarly, in the social benefits of river restoration study, the authors conduct a systematic review of the literature on river restoration from an ecosystem services perspective, but they do not mention any specific datasets used in the studies they review.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query regarding the datasets used in deep learning pipelines.
