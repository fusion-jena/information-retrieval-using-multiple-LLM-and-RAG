The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of NAIP (National Agriculture Imagery Program) imagery for classification purposes. NAIP imagery is aerial imagery data typically provided in a raster format such as GeoTIFF.

Additionally, the context discusses the potential use of online spectral libraries and other remote sensing products with more detailed spectral information. These sources would also likely provide raster data in a format such as GeoTIFF.

There is no mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV in the provided context.

Answer:::
The provided context suggests that raster data formats such as GeoTIFF are used in the deep learning pipeline for image classification purposes. However, specific information about other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV is not provided.
