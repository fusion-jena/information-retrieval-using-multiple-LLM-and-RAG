Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no specific strategy mentioned for monitoring the model performance during training. However, it does discuss several sampling strategies used to address the issue of unbalanced training data in land use and land cover (LULC) mapping.

The studies referred to in the context have used various sampling techniques such as major category undersampling, minor category oversampling, and combinations of oversampling and undersampling. These strategies were used to improve the accuracy of LULC mapping, particularly in regions with highly heterogeneous landscapes like Madagascar.

Moreover, the context introduces a hexagonal random-sampling strategy along with a tile model to further mitigate the limitations of the overall model and tackle the problem of unbalanced training data in RF-based LULC mapping.

However, none of these studies explicitly mention a strategy for monitoring the model performance during training. Monitoring the model performance during training is crucial to prevent overfitting and to ensure that the model is generalizing well to unseen data. Common strategies for monitoring model performance during training include using validation sets, cross-validation, and early stopping based on a performance metric.

Therefore, while the context provides valuable information about sampling strategies for addressing unbalanced training data in LULC mapping, it does not answer the query regarding the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
