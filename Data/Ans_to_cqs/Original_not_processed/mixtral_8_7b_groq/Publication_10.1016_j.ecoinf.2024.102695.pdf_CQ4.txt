The provided context discusses the Transformer model and its components, but it does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide information on the data augmentation techniques such as Flipping, Rotating, and Scaling.

Data augmentation techniques are crucial for improving the performance and robustness of deep learning models, especially when dealing with small or imbalanced datasets. Some common data augmentation techniques for images include:

1. Flipping: Horizontal or vertical flipping of images to increase the dataset size and help the model generalize better.
2. Rotating: Rotating images by a certain angle to simulate real-world scenarios and improve model performance.
3. Scaling: Changing the size of images while maintaining their aspect ratio, which can help the model learn to recognize objects at different scales.

These techniques can be applied to images during the preprocessing step in the deep learning pipeline. However, the provided context focuses on the Transformer model and its self-attention mechanism, and it does not discuss data augmentation techniques.
