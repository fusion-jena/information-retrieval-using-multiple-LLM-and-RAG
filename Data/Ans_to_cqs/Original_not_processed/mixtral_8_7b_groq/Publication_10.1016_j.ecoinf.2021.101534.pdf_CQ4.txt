The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline described in the context include audio-specific transformations that increase the variability of the audio data in the training dataset. These techniques include changing the frequency, pitch, and volume of audio signals; shifting, rotating, and zooming in the time and/or frequency domains of spectrograms; and adding additional noise.

One specific augmentation technique used is Mosaic augmentation, which was first developed in YOLOv3 and used in YOLOv4 and YOLOv5 due to its high efficiency in enriching a small training dataset. In Mosaic augmentation, four original spectrograms are randomly selected and merged into one big input image for model training. This results in a sound object in each spectrogram being placed in a new position in the merged image, and its vertical position losing the frequency information. To address this issue and encode the frequency information of audio signals in a spectrogram, the rainbow mapping technique was developed. This technique divides a spectrogram into five bands along the frequency axis and uses a unique gradient colormap for each band to distinguish the difference in energy and frequency.

While the context does not explicitly mention techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling, it is possible that these image-specific augmentation techniques were applied to the spectrograms as they are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. However, the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.

In summary, the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline described in the context include audio-specific transformations such as changing the frequency, pitch, and volume of audio signals; shifting, rotating, and zooming in the time and/or frequency domains of spectrograms; and adding additional noise. Additionally, Mosaic augmentation and rainbow mapping techniques were used to enrich the training dataset and encode frequency information, respectively. It is possible that image-specific augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling were also applied, but this is not explicitly stated in the context.
