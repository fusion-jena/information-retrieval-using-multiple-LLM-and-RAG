Answer:::

In the study, the dataset was divided into two subsets: a training dataset for learning the optimal model structure and a validation dataset to test its performance. A total of 75% of the data were devoted to model training, and the remaining 25% were used for testing. To maintain the covariance structure among the predictor variables relatively intact between the training and testing datasets, random sampling was chosen over cluster sampling.

The Random Forest (RF) modeling approach was adopted due to its robustness in handling preprocessing burdens, such as no feature scaling and resistance to outliers. The RF model's performance was evaluated using four metrics: adj_R2, RMSE, MAE, and KGE. The model's performance was assessed for different time lags, and the optimal RF model was selected based on the highest accuracy achieved.

The RF model's performance was monitored during training by comparing the model's performance on the training and testing datasets. The gray columns and orange line in Figure 4 represent the adj_R2 and KGE values, while the blue solid and dashed lines correspond to the RMSE and MAE values, respectively. This comparison allowed for the identification of overfitting or underfitting and adjustment of the model's complexity accordingly.

Furthermore, the relative importance of the predictor variables was assessed using the optimized RF model results. The most important predictors for each season were identified, providing insights into the factors influencing chlorophyll a concentrations in the Nanji wetland of Poyang Lake.

In summary, the study implemented a robust strategy for monitoring the model's performance during training by dividing the dataset into training and testing subsets, comparing the model's performance on both subsets, and assessing the relative importance of the predictor variables. This approach allowed for the selection of the optimal RF model and provided insights into the factors influencing chlorophyll a concentrations in the study area.
