Answer:::

The articles provided do not give a detailed explanation of the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention the use of camera traps for wildlife monitoring, which is one source of raw data in this particular context. Camera traps are sensors that capture images or videos when triggered by movement or heat. They are often used in wildlife research to study animal behavior, distribution, and abundance.

In the study by Torney et al. (2019), the authors used aerial survey images, which could have been obtained from planes or drones equipped with cameras. Similarly, Vecvanags et al. (2022) used camera trap images for their study on ungulate detection and species classification.

It is also mentioned that the data was collected in Maine, USA (Whytock et al., 2022), but the specific method of data collection is not provided.

In addition to surveys and sensors, public datasets are another source of raw data for deep learning. These datasets are often made available by research institutions, government agencies, or companies and can be used for training and testing machine learning models.

Overall, while the articles do not provide a comprehensive list of methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, they do mention the use of camera traps and aerial survey images for wildlife monitoring.
