Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the deployment of a trained deep learning model. The articles focus on the development of the PLUS model, a land use change prediction model, and the analysis of vegetation dynamics. They discuss the use of the random forest algorithm, cellular automata, and a multi-type random patch seed mechanism in the PLUS model. The articles also cite other studies related to vegetation and land use changes. However, there is no mention of model serialization or platform selection for deploying a deep learning model.

Answer:::

In summary, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model.
