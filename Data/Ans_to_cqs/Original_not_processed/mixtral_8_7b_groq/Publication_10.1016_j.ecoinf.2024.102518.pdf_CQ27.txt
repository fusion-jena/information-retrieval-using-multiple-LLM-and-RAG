Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, the text does describe the process of determining the optimal model parameters for a species distribution model using maximum entropy and machine learning techniques.

The authors used occurrence data and environmental variables to train the model. They considered five feature classes ('L', 'Q', 'LQ', 'LQP') and varied the regularization multiplier from 0.5 to 5. They evaluated the models using the Akaike minimum information criterion (delta.AICc) and selected the model with the minimum delta.AICc value as the optimal model. They also considered a model with delta.AICc < 2 as credible.

To further evaluate the model's performance, the authors used the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) and the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). They reported the mean AUC-ROC as 95.5% and the average CBI index for the validation dataset as 82.6%.

Therefore, while the context does not provide information on the deployment process, it does describe the steps taken to train and evaluate the model's performance.
