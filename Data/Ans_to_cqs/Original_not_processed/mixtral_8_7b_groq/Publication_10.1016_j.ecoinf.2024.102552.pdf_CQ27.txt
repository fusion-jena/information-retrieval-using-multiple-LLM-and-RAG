Based on the provided context, there is no information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. The text mainly discusses the methodology and results of a historical ecology study that involved the analysis of aerial images and ground truthing data to understand changes in ecosystems over time.

However, the text does mention the use of machine learning tools for refining classifications, but it does not go into detail about the specific process of deploying a deep learning model. It is possible that such information is not relevant to the study or was not included in the provided text.

Answer:::
In summary, while the text provides information about a historical ecology study using aerial images and machine learning tools, it does not contain details about the process of deploying a trained deep learning model.
