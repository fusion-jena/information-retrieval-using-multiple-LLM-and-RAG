Answer:::

The provided context does not directly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it is common practice in deep learning to use a fixed seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This is because many aspects of deep learning models, such as weight initialization and data shuffling, involve some degree of randomness. By setting a fixed seed value, the same sequence of random numbers is generated each time the model is trained, which ensures that the training process is repeatable.

In the context of mapping global orchid assemblages with deep learning, it is likely that a fixed seed value was used to ensure the reproducibility of the results. This is particularly important when optimizing the model, as the randomness involved in the training process can affect the final set of parameters obtained.

Additionally, the use of cross-validation techniques can help to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, or folds, and training the model on different combinations of these folds. This helps to reduce the impact of any randomness introduced during the training process, as the model is trained and evaluated on different subsets of the data.

Overall, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that a fixed seed value and cross-validation techniques were used to ensure reproducibility and reduce the impact of randomness on the final model.
