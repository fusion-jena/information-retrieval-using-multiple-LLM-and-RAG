Answer:::
The pieces of context provided do not give specific information about the deep learning frameworks used to build the models. However, they do mention various models and techniques that were used, such as UNet, VGG16, EfficientNet, and Count-ception. These models can be implemented in various deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch. Therefore, while the specific frameworks are not mentioned, it can be inferred that one of these popular deep learning frameworks was used to build the models.
