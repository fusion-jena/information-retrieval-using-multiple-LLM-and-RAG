The provided context does not contain specific information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss various data repositories and databases that contain biodiversity information, including FishBase, GBIF, and OBIS. These databases store taxonomic information and species occurrence records, which can be used in a deep learning pipeline, but the context does not specify the data formats.

In general, deep learning pipelines can use various data formats, including images, audio, video, and structured data formats like CSV or JSON. The choice of data format depends on the specific problem and the type of data available. For instance, in computer vision tasks, images are commonly used as input data, while in natural language processing tasks, text data in the form of CSV or JSON files might be used.

In the context of biodiversity data, occurrence records can be stored in structured formats like CSV, where each row represents a record with columns for taxonomic information, geographic coordinates, date, and other relevant attributes. Additionally, media files like images or audio recordings of species can also be used in a deep learning pipeline.

An example of using biodiversity data in a deep learning pipeline could be developing a species identification model using a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this case, images of species could be used as input data, and the CNN would be trained to predict the species based on the image. The training data would consist of a large set of labeled images, where each image is associated with a species label. These labeled images could be stored in a structured format like CSV, where each row contains the image file name and the corresponding species label.

In summary, the provided context does not contain specific information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, in general, deep learning pipelines can use various data formats, including images, audio, video, and structured data formats like CSV. In the context of biodiversity data, occurrence records can be stored in structured formats like CSV, and media files like images or audio recordings of species can also be used in a deep learning pipeline.
