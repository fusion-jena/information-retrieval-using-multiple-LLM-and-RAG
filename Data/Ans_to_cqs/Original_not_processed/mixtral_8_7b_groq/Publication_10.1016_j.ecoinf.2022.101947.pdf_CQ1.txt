Answer:

The provided context discusses a specific method for collecting raw data in the context of wildlife population monitoring, called Footprint Identification Technology (FIT). FIT involves the collection of images of animal footprints, which are then used to identify and count individual animals. This method utilizes digital cameras or smartphones to capture images of footprints, along with a metric scale for size reference. The images are stored on external or cloud-based drives and analyzed using a standard home-office laptop computer.

In addition to FIT, the context also mentions the use of camera traps and environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys for low-density wildlife populations. Camera traps involve the use of cameras that are triggered by motion or heat to capture images of animals. eDNA surveys involve the collection and analysis of DNA samples from environmental samples, such as water or soil, to detect the presence of specific species.

However, the provided context does not mention the use of public datasets or other types of sensors for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It is likely that the specific focus of the text on wildlife population monitoring may have limited the discussion to methods commonly used in that field.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, as discussed in the provided context, include Footprint Identification Technology (FIT), camera traps, and environmental DNA (eDNA) surveys. These methods involve the use of digital cameras or smartphones, metric scales, external or cloud-based storage, and laptop computers for analysis. Public datasets and other types of sensors are not mentioned in the context.
