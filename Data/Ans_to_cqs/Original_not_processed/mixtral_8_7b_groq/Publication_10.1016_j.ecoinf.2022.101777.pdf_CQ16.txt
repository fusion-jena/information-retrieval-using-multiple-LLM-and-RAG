Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the image classification. However, it is mentioned that the study used the SCP (Semi-Automatic Classification Plug-in) functions for the RF (Random Forest) classifier and performed an accuracy assessment using parameters such as Error of Commission (EC), Error of Omission (EO), Producer Accuracy (PA), and User Accuracy (UA).

In general, training of machine learning models, including image classification, can be considered complete when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving or reaches a satisfactory level. This can be achieved through various criteria, such as:

1. Validation Loss Plateau: Training can be stopped when the validation loss (e.g., cross-entropy loss for classification problems) stops decreasing or reaches a minimum value, indicating that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data.
2. Early Stopping: This technique involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training. If the performance does not improve for a certain number of epochs, training is stopped to prevent overfitting.
3. Satisfactory Performance: Training can be considered complete when the model achieves a desired level of performance on the validation set, as measured by performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.

In the context of the provided information, it can be inferred that the training of the RF classifier was likely complete when the classifier achieved a satisfactory level of accuracy in classifying land cover types, as assessed by the accuracy parameters mentioned. However, without explicit information about the training stopping criteria, this is only an educated guess.
