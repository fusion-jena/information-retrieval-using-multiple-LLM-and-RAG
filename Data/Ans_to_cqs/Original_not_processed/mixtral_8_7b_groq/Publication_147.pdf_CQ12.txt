Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This information is provided in the context in the first paragraph, where it mentions that "the segmentation convolutional neural network was implemented in the Python programming language using the Keras deep learning library" and in the following paragraph where it specifies that "the inputs used by our CNN model were...". Additionally, the U-Net architecture, which is a type of CNN, is specifically mentioned as being used.
