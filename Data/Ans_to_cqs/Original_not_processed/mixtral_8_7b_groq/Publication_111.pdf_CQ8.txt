Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. The paper "Marine Data Prediction: An Evaluation of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Statistical Predictive Models" discusses the use of a GRU-DNN model for predicting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH) for the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency dataset. However, it does not mention the specific location of the code repository, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
