The provided context discusses the use of AutoGluon for training machine learning models, including deep learning models, but it does not explicitly mention which specific deep learning frameworks (such as TensorFlow or PyTorch) are used by AutoGluon.

AutoGluon is an open-source AutoML library that simplifies the process of training high-performance machine learning models on structured data with minimal code. It automates various tasks, including data pre-processing, feature engineering, model training, and ensembling. AutoGluon uses advanced data processing, deep learning, and ensemble techniques to train a collection of machine learning models, including neural networks.

However, the context does not provide information on the specific deep learning framework that AutoGluon uses to build the neural networks. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch are popular deep learning frameworks, and it is possible that AutoGluon uses either or both of them.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.

Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning frameworks are used by AutoGluon for building neural networks.
