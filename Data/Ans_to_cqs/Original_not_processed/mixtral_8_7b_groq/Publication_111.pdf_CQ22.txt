Answer:::

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the context provided are the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the Mean Squared Error (MSE), the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and the R-squared score (R2). 

The MAE is used to determine the average difference between the original and forecasted values. It is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between the true and predicted values divided by the number of observations. 

The MSE and RMSE, on the other hand, are used to assess the accuracy of regression problems. The MSE is the average of the square of the differences between actual and predicted values, while the RMSE is the square root of the MSE. These metrics give more weight to large errors, providing a measure of the dispersion of the errors.

Finally, the R-squared score (R2) is used to measure the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). It ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit.

In the study, these metrics were used to compare the performance of the deep learning model with other machine learning models and a statistical predictive model for forecasting Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and Significant Wave Height (SWH) on a real dataset obtained from the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency. The results showed that the deep learning model slightly outperformed the machine learning models for overall performance, and both of these approaches greatly outperformed the statistical predictive model.
