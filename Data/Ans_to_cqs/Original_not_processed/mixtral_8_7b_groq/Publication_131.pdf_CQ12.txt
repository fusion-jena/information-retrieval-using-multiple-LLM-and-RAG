Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is stated in the first piece of context, which mentions that "proper databases for CNN training" are used. The context goes on to provide a detailed description of the CNN architecture used in the study. The CNN consists of multiple convolution layers, each with a different number of output filters (32 for the first layer, 64 for the second, and 128 for the final one). A kernel size of 3 Ã— 3 is used for each convolution layer. After the convolution layers, there is a fully connected layer with 512 neurons, followed by a softmax layer for classification. The CNN is trained on a dataset of audio samples, with 80% of the samples used for training and 20% used for testing. To augment the training set, additional audio samples were generated from each of the original samples, resulting in a total of 10,548 training samples. The CNN was implemented using the Keras library in Python.
