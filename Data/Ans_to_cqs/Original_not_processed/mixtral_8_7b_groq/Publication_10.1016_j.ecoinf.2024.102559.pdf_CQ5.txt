Answer:::

The provided context does not include information on specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline related to image classification tasks such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention the use of hyperspectral and multispectral earth observation data for land use and land cover classification in Vali, Comai, & Matteucci (2020). Additionally, Prasai et al. (2021) utilized the Google Earth Engine Python API and NAIP imagery for land use and land cover classification in Florida, USA.

In the context of machine learning and image processing, Blondel et al. (2011) introduced scikit-learn, a machine learning library in Python, and Van Der Walt et al. (2014) presented scikit-image, an image processing library in Python. These libraries can be used in conjunction with deep learning frameworks for image-related tasks.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the use of MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet datasets, it does refer to the use of hyperspectral and multispectral earth observation data, as well as NAIP imagery for land use and land cover classification tasks in deep learning pipelines.
