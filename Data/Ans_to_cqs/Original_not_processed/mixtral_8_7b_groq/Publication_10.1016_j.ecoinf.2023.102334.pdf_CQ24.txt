Answer:::

The provided context discusses various aspects of a deep learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, model architecture, and experimental setup, but it does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the pipeline. However, there are some implicit strategies that can be inferred from the given information.

Firstly, in the context of data preprocessing, the training and test sets are randomly generated in an 8:2 ratio. This implies that a random seed value might have been set to ensure the reproducibility of the random split. Randomness in data preprocessing can help prevent overfitting and make the model more robust to variations in the input data.

Secondly, in the context of model architecture, the Vision Transformer (ViT) model is mentioned, which is based on a self-attention mechanism. The self-attention mechanism calculates the relationship between all pairs of tokens in the input sequence, which can be seen as a way of handling randomness. By considering all possible relationships, the model can capture a wider range of patterns and variations in the input data.

Thirdly, in the context of experimental setup, the authors mention that they used ablation and comparison experiments to demonstrate the validity of their work. Ablation experiments involve removing or modifying certain components of the model or pipeline and observing the effect on the performance. By performing multiple ablation experiments with different random seeds, the authors can ensure that their results are not due to random chance.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, there are some implicit strategies that can be inferred. These include setting a random seed value for data preprocessing, using a self-attention mechanism in the model architecture to capture a wider range of patterns and variations, and performing ablation experiments with different random seeds to ensure the reproducibility and validity of the results.
