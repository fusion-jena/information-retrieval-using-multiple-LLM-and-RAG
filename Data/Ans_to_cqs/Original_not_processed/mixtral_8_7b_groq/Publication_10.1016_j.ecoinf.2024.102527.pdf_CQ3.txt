Answer:::

The provided context discusses the datasets used in a deep learning study but does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used. However, it can be inferred that the images in the ImageNet dataset are manually annotated, which suggests some form of image labeling was employed.

ImageNet is a benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision, and it contains 1.2 million training samples, each belonging to one of the 1000 classes. Manual annotation implies that human annotators have labeled these images with the appropriate class, indicating the use of image-level classification annotation.

For the other datasets, Snapshot Serengeti (SS) and Lasha Mountain (LSM), the context explains that they are camera trap image datasets and that images within the same event are significantly similar to each other. To prevent poor generalization of the DCNN model, they kept the integrity of events during data splitting, putting all images of an event into the same dataset. This suggests that, for these datasets, the annotation technique might not involve bounding boxes or instance segmentation, as these methods would require precise annotations for each object within an image, which could be challenging and time-consuming given the similarity between images in the same event. Instead, it is more likely that these datasets use image-level classification annotation, similar to ImageNet.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used, it can be inferred that image-level classification annotation was employed for the ImageNet dataset and is likely used for the SS and LSM datasets as well. The context does not mention the use of other annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
