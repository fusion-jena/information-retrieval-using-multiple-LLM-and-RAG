The provided context does not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the data preprocessing methods used in a specific study related to human activity (HA) and natural endowment (NE) coupled zoning index system.

In this study, the authors used the ArcGIS10.5 software for large-scale partitioning of data sources. They also used various quantitative methods to preprocess the data, such as using population density, economic density, and HA intensity for the human activity data; precipitation, temperature, evapotranspiration, and climatic conditions for the natural endowment data; and slope, NDVI, and vegetation type for the geographic conditions data.

However, the authors do not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

Answer:::
The provided context does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, we cannot answer this query without additional information.
