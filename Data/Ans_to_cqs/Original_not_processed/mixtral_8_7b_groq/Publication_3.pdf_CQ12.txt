Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is a subset of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) designed specifically for image classification tasks and pattern recognition. CNNs are built on three types of layers: convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Convolutional layers are the most important as they apply hierarchical feature extraction and decomposition of input images. Pooling layers reduce the number of parameters and necessary computation, while fully connected layers perform the actual classification at the end of the pipeline. The model was calibrated for classification challenges using different numbers of training steps, and the optimum number of training steps was found to be 4000 for all challenges except Challenge 3, where 8000 training steps proved to be the optimum number. The model was tested for identifying new species not present in the reference library, and the results showed that the overall correct identification rate was 94.3%. However, the lowest identification rates were for closely-related species Platymantis isarog and P. montanus, with 70 and 75% correct identification rates, respectively. The model was also tested for identifying all 41 species, and the results showed that the model performed well for a reference library that was twice as large as the original.
