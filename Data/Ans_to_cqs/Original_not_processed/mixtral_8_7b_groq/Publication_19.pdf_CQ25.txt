Answer:::
The deep learning models mentioned in the context are used for image classification. Specifically, they are trained to classify images taken from camera traps into different animal species. This is evident in the statement "This research reported here is to automatically classify images retrieved from camera traps" and the use of evaluation metrics such as macro-F1 scores, which are commonly used for classification tasks.

Moreover, the four models used in the study, namely Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, and DenseNet-121, are all well-known convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures that have been widely used for image classification tasks. CNNs are a type of deep learning model that is particularly good at processing grid-like data, such as images, by learning hierarchical features from local to global patterns.

The models were pre-initialized with ImageNet weights, which are weights learned from a large-scale image classification dataset containing 1.2 million images and 1000 categories. This transfer learning approach, where a model trained on one task is re-purposed for another related task, is a common strategy in deep learning to reduce training time and improve performance, especially when the amount of data for the new task is limited.

Finally, the models were evaluated based on their accuracy and size, which are important considerations for deploying the models on IoT edge devices such as Raspberry Pi. Smaller model size means less memory and computational resources required, which is crucial for running deep learning models on resource-constrained devices.
