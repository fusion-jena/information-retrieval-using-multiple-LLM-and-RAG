Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for soil salinity distribution mapping. However, it is mentioned that an automated deep learning convolutional neural network algorithm was applied. In deep learning, optimization techniques are used to minimize the loss function and find the best set of weights and biases for the model.

Some commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad. SGD is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the weights and biases in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad are adaptive learning rate methods that update the learning rate for each parameter based on the past gradients.

Without specific information from the context, it is difficult to determine which optimization technique was used in the deep learning pipeline for soil salinity distribution mapping. However, it is mentioned that the deep learning model was evaluated based on four criteria: coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE), and correlation coefficient (COR). These evaluation metrics can provide insights into the performance of the deep learning model and the optimization technique used.

In summary, while the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline for soil salinity distribution mapping is not mentioned in the provided context, commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad.
