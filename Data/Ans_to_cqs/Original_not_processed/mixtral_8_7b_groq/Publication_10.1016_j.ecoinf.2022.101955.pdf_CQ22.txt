The provided context does not include information about a deep learning model. However, it does provide details about the accuracy assessment of k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Random Forest (RF) classifications for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping.

For the kNN classification, the following metrics were used to evaluate the model's performance:

1. Overall accuracy: This represents the proportion of correctly classified pixels out of the total number of pixels. In 2020, the overall accuracy for kNN was 91.1%, and in 2000, it was 89.7%.
2. Kappa statistics: This is a measure of agreement between the predicted and actual classifications, considering the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance. In 2020, the Kappa statistics for kNN was 89%, and in 2000, it was 88%.
3. Producer's accuracy: This measures the proportion of correctly classified pixels for each individual class out of the total number of actual pixels for that class. For example, in 2020, the producer's accuracy for croplands in kNN was 94.3%.

For the RF classification, the following metrics were used to evaluate the model's performance:

1. Overall accuracy: This represents the proportion of correctly classified pixels out of the total number of pixels. In 2020, the overall accuracy for RF was 90.3%, and in 2000, it was 99.3%.
2. Kappa statistics: This is a measure of agreement between the predicted and actual classifications, considering the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance. In 2020, the Kappa statistics for RF was 94%, and in 2000, it was 97%.
3. Producer's accuracy: This measures the proportion of correctly classified pixels for each individual class out of the total number of actual pixels for that class. However, the provided context does not include specific values for producer's accuracy for RF.

Therefore, while the context does not provide information about the metrics used for a deep learning model, it does provide details about accuracy assessment metrics for kNN and RF classifications, including overall accuracy, Kappa statistics, and producer's accuracy.
