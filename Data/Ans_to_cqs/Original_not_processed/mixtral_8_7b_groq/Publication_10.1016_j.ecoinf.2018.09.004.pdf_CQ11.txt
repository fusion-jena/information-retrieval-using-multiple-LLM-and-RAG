Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct information given about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context focuses on the description of two machine learning algorithms, K-nearest neighbors and Decision Tree, and the application of a supervised learning approach for seagrass detection in the Mediterranean. It does not mention or provide a link to any data repository related to a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
