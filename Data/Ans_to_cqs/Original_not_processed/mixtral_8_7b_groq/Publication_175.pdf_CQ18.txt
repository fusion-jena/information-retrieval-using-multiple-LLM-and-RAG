Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the models was evaluated by measuring the mean accuracy and standard deviation on the T2 test-dataset after training on different datasets.

In the first experiment, a deep ResNet model was trained on the large AT0 dataset, and the mean accuracy was calculated on the T2 test-dataset. In the second experiment, the same DL architecture was trained with a much more limited dataset (AT1), and the performance was evaluated by comparing the accuracy with the baseline established in the first experiment.

Furthermore, the performance of the models was also evaluated by training the same DL architecture with limited datasets obtained by subsampling T0 to 250 and 500 images per class. The accuracy was then calculated for each species, and the results were analyzed to compare the performance of the models trained on different datasets.

Therefore, while the specific strategy for monitoring the model performance during training is not mentioned, it can be inferred that the performance was evaluated by measuring the accuracy of the models on the T2 test-dataset after training on different datasets.
