Answer:::

The provided context discusses the development and comparison of a deep learning model called SeedNet, but it does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained model. However, it can be inferred that the model was likely to be deployed using standard deep learning deployment techniques.

Answer:::

In general, deep learning model deployment involves several steps, including model serialization, platform selection, and integration with existing systems. Model serialization involves saving the trained model in a format that can be easily loaded and used for making predictions. Common model serialization formats include HDF5, TensorFlow's SavedModel, and ONNX.

Once the model is serialized, the next step is to choose a platform for deployment. The platform selection depends on several factors, such as the required inference speed, the available hardware resources, and the need for real-time predictions. Common deep learning deployment platforms include cloud services like AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud AI Platform, and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, as well as on-premises solutions like TensorFlow Serving and TorchServe.

After selecting the platform, the serialized model is loaded and integrated with existing systems. This integration may involve building a web API for serving the model's predictions, or embedding the model in a mobile or embedded device.

In the case of SeedNet, the context suggests that it was implemented using a CNN architecture with six learnable layers, five of which are convolutional layers, and the last one is fully-connected. The ReLU activation function was applied to the output of every convolutional layer, and a pooling layer was inserted between successive convolutional layers to reduce the amount of parameters and computation in the network. The input image size was 224 × 224 × 3, and the output of the last fully-connected layer was fed to a N-way softmax, which produces a distribution over the N class labels to predict.

Based on the context, it can be inferred that SeedNet was likely to be deployed using standard deep learning deployment techniques, such as model serialization, platform selection, and integration with existing systems. However, the specific details of the deployment process are not provided in the context.
