Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training for the IUC-NN (IUCN Red List assessment using Neural Network) model. However, it can be inferred that some common postprocessing steps such as metrics calculation and confusion matrix might have been used.

Metrics calculation: The performance of the IUC-NN model might have been evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics can provide insights into how well the model is performing in terms of correctly classifying the conservation status of orchid species.

Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix can be used to evaluate the performance of the IUC-NN model by comparing the predicted conservation status with the actual conservation status of orchid species in the test dataset. A confusion matrix can provide information on the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, which can be used to calculate various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Other possible postprocessing steps:

Saliency maps: Saliency maps can be used to visualize the features that the IUC-NN model is using to make predictions. Saliency maps can provide insights into which features are most important for the model's predictions and can help identify any potential biases in the model.

Model interpretation: The IUC-NN model's predictions can be interpreted in the context of the features used for prediction. For example, if the model predicts that a particular orchid species is possibly threatened, it might be useful to examine the species' spatial distribution, data quality, and sampling bias to understand the reasons behind the prediction.

Overall, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps used after the IUC-NN model training, it is likely that some common steps such as metrics calculation and confusion matrix were used. Additionally, other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps and model interpretation might have been used to provide insights into the model's predictions and identify any potential biases.
