The data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context is instance segmentation. This method involves creating precise pixel-level annotations or "gonal mask contours" around the target object, which in this case is the fish body boundary. The annotations are created manually using the VGG Image Annotator (VIA) to assign pixel coordinates and construct a website repository to serve as a storage and sharing platform for these segmentation models.

The authors intentionally assigned all segmentation masks directly around the fish body, where the foreground pixels of the target fish body meet those of the background. This approach allows for accurate and scalable image pre-processing in biology, facilitating rapid processing of images for ecological and evolutionary studies.

The use of instance segmentation in this study is motivated by the lack of readily available image datasets with high-resolution annotations for training neural networks. The authors aim to inspire other biologists to create pre-trained models for their organisms of interest by engaging with deep learning applications and overcoming the challenges posed by the taxonomic imbalance in biodiversity representation in readily accessible, annotated datasets.

In summary, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context is instance segmentation, where precise pixel-level annotations are created around the target object, specifically the fish body boundary. This method facilitates accurate and scalable image pre-processing in biology and encourages other researchers to create pre-trained models for their organisms of interest.
