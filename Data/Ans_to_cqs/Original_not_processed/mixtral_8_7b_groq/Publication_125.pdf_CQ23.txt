Based on the information provided, it is not explicitly stated what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some clues that suggest that data augmentation was used, which can help improve the model's performance on unseen data.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the diversity of the training set by applying various transformations to the existing data. This can include rotations, zooming, shearing, shifting, brightness changes, and horizontal or vertical flipping. Figure 6 in the document illustrates these data augmentation techniques. By using data augmentation, the model can learn to be more invariant to these transformations, which can help improve its performance on new data.

Additionally, the document mentions that the model was trained and validated on satellite image data, but it does not provide information on how the data was split into training and validation sets. Ideally, a stratified splitting approach would be used to ensure that the training and validation sets have a similar distribution of classes.

Cross-validation is another technique that can be used to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. This involves dividing the data into k subsets, training the model on k-1 subsets, and testing it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated k times, with a different subset used for testing each time. The results are then averaged across the k runs to provide a more robust estimate of the model's performance. However, there is no mention of cross-validation being used in this study.

In summary, while the document does not explicitly state what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, there is some evidence to suggest that data augmentation was used. However, other techniques such as stratified splitting and cross-validation are not mentioned. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query based on the information provided.
