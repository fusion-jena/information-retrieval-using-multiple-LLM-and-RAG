Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the underwater fish species identification model. However, it can be inferred that the training process might include validation loss plateau or convergence of model performance as possible stopping criteria, which are commonly used in machine learning model training.

In the context, the authors mention that they used a targeted fish species dataset and divided it into training and validation sets in an 8:2 ratio. This implies that they used a validation set to monitor the model's performance during the training process. Typically, validation loss plateau or a decrease in improvement of model performance on the validation set are used as indicators that the model has been sufficiently trained, and continuing to train the model may lead to overfitting.

Furthermore, the authors mention that they prioritized streamlining the model architecture and enhancing its detection speed while maintaining model accuracy. This suggests that they might have used early stopping techniques to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well to new data. Early stopping involves monitoring the model's performance on the validation set during training and stopping the training process once the validation loss starts to increase or the improvement in model performance plateaus.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, it can be inferred that validation loss plateau or convergence of model performance might have been used as stopping criteria in the training process.
