Answer:::

The specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the given context are not explicitly stated. However, it is mentioned that the mean square error (MSE) between the model output and the measured data was calculated during the process of determining the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer and the optimal learning rate. The MSE is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of regression models, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), as it measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values. Therefore, it can be inferred that the MSE was used as a performance metric for the ANN in this study.

Another point to consider is that the study aimed to develop a robust ANN to predict mosquito abundances using multiple regression model (MLR) results as input features. The ANN was designed with five input variables, one output variable, and one node accounting for bias in both the input and hidden layers. The number of neurons in the hidden layer and the learning rate were determined using a trial-and-error method and an early stopping technique to prevent overfitting. These methods suggest that the model's performance was evaluated based on its ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data, which is an essential aspect of deep learning model evaluation.

In summary, while the specific metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model are not explicitly stated in the given context, it can be inferred that the MSE was used as a performance metric. Additionally, the study's focus on developing a robust ANN that can generalize from the training data suggests that other metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall, may have also been considered to evaluate the model's performance.
