Answer:::

The context does not provide specific information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the CNN and XGB models. However, it is mentioned that the models were trained for a fixed number of epochs, with each epoch consisting of 4800 training samples. The CNN model was trained for 110 epochs, while the number of epochs for the XGB model is not specified.

In general, training of machine learning models can be determined complete by various criteria such as:

1. Validation Loss Plateau: Training can be stopped when the validation loss stops decreasing or starts increasing, indicating that the model is overfitting to the training data.
2. Fixed Number of Epochs: Training can be stopped after a fixed number of epochs, as was done in the study described in the context.
3. Early Stopping: Training can be stopped using early stopping techniques, where training is stopped when the performance on a validation set stops improving for a certain number of epochs.
4. Patience: Training can be stopped based on patience, where training is stopped if the validation loss does not improve for a certain number of epochs.

It is possible that one or a combination of these criteria were used to determine when training was complete for the CNN and XGB models in the study, but the context does not provide specific information on this.
