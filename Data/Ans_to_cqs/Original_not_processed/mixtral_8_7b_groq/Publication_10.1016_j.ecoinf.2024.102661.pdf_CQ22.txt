Answer: The performance of the deep learning models in the study is evaluated using two primary metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These are error-based measures that assess the difference between the predicted and actual values.

The MAE is the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values across all data points. It provides a straightforward measure of accuracy, as it represents the average magnitude of the errors. A lower MAE indicates better performance.

The RMSE, on the other hand, is the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. It gives a higher weight to larger errors, providing a measure of the dispersion of the errors. A lower RMSE signifies more accurate predictions.

In the context of this study, the MAE and RMSE are used to compare the performance of different models, including ARIMA, BPNN, LSTM, and TPEBO-LSTM. The TPEBO-LSTM model demonstrates a substantial reduction in both MAE and RMSE compared to the other models, indicating its superior performance.

While the context does not explicitly mention metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall, it can be inferred that these are not the primary evaluation metrics used in this study. Instead, the focus is on error-based measures that directly assess the difference between the predicted and actual values.
