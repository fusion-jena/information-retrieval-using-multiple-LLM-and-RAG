The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and percentage bias (PBIAS) are the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in estimating aquatic ecosystem health indices. The NSE is a commonly used score in hydrological and environmental models, which measures the relative magnitude of the residual variance, indicating the degree of 1:1 line fitness of the observed versus estimated data plot. NSE ranges from negative infinity to 1, and a value closer to 1 indicates better model performance. On the other hand, RMSE measures the differences between values predicted by a model and the values actually observed, and a lower RMSE value indicates better model performance. Lastly, PBIAS measures the average tendency of the model to over- or under-estimate the observed data, and a value of 0 indicates perfect model performance. These metrics were used to compare the performance of the CNN model and CNN with an autoencoder, as well as conventional machine learning models with ANN, SVM, RF, and XGBoost for estimating TDI, BMI, and FAI values.
