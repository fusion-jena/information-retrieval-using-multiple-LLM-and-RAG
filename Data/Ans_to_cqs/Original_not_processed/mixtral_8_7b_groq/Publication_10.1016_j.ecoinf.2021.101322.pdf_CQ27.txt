Answer:::

The text provided describes the training and implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the Keras and TensorFlow software packages implemented in Python. The CNN was implemented using a specific architecture called EfficientNet-B4, and pre-trained weights were used for transfer learning. The training was performed on Nvidia P100 accelerator cards with 12 GB of GPU memory, using CUDA version 9.1 and CuDNN.

However, the text does not provide specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It does not mention any steps such as model serialization, platform selection, or model deployment.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer this query.
