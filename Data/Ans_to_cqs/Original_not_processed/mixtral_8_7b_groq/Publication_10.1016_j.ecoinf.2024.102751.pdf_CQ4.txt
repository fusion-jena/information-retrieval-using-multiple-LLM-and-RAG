The provided pieces of context do not directly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, some of the related concepts and techniques are discussed, such as the use of machine learning and deep neural networks for increasing the accuracy of soil moisture prediction.

In general, data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, improve model generalization, and reduce overfitting. Some of the most popular data augmentation techniques for image data include flipping, rotating, scaling, and cropping.

Flipping: This technique involves flipping the image horizontally or vertically, which can help the model learn symmetries and invariances in the data.

Rotating: This technique involves rotating the image by a certain angle, which can help the model learn rotational invariances and generalize better to new viewpoints.

Scaling: This technique involves scaling the image by a certain factor, which can help the model learn scale invariances and generalize better to different resolutions and distances.

Cropping: This technique involves randomly cropping a portion of the image, which can help the model learn spatial invariances and generalize better to different contexts and scales.

Other data augmentation techniques for image data include brightness and contrast adjustment, noise addition, and elastic deformation.

In the context of the provided study, it seems reasonable to apply some of these data augmentation techniques to the satellite imagery data, in order to increase the diversity and size of the training dataset, and improve the accuracy and generalization of the soil moisture prediction model. However, the specific data augmentation techniques and parameters would need to be carefully chosen and validated based on the characteristics and quality of the data, as well as the objectives and assumptions of the study.
