Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of deep learning pipelines. However, it does discuss data preprocessing and machine learning techniques in general.

In the context, the study talks about the Su et al., 2020a approach that uses machine learning and geostatistical methods for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) in Chinese subtropical forests. This suggests the use of various machine learning techniques for predicting AGB, but it does not explicitly mention any bias reduction methods.

Strandberg and Låås (2019) compare Neural Networks, Lasso Regularized Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosted Trees in modeling binary sales, which implies the use of different machine learning algorithms for sales prediction. Again, there is no explicit reference to data bias reduction techniques.

The context also discusses the SVR (Support Vector Regression) algorithm and its suitability for making predictions with restricted datasets. SVR tuning involves selecting the appropriate kernel function and optimizing the "C" parameter, but it does not mention any techniques to address data bias.

In summary, the provided context discusses various machine learning techniques and preprocessing methods but does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the given information.
