Based on the provided context, the specific type of deep learning model is not mentioned. However, it is clear that the models are being used for species distribution modeling. The models are trained using presence and background point data to predict the presence of a species.

To ensure consistent model results, three random selections of background points were made from the training dataset. These selections included the "1x" selection, which had the same number of background points as presences, the "10x" selection, which had ten times the number of background points as presences, and the "10 K" selection, which had 10,000 background points.

The models were trained separately using each background point subsample and evaluated using an evaluation dataset. Model performance was measured using Area Under the Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistics (TSS).

An ensemble of models was also created to model performance and overcome any issues that any single model might have. However, it was found that Random Forest (RF) outperformed all the ensemble models, suggesting that if researchers use a single modeling approach, they should consider using RF.

Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning models in this context is species distribution modeling, where the models are trained using presence and background point data to predict the presence of a species. The models are evaluated using AUC and TSS, and an ensemble of models is created to improve model performance. However, it is important to note that RF outperformed all the ensemble models, indicating that it may be a more effective modeling approach.
