Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of machine learning models in a study, including Random Forest (RF), LightGBM, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. However, the specific hyperparameters for the RF and LightGBM models are not detailed. Therefore, we cannot answer this question without making assumptions.

For the ANN model, the following hyperparameters were used:

1. n_estimators (number of trees): Not applicable for ANN, as it is not a tree-based model.
2. max_depth (maximum depth of the tree): Not applicable for ANN.
3. n_layers (number of middle layers): 0. The model with the input layer followed by the output layer was determined to be the best.
4. units (initial layer): 90.
5. units (middle layers): 60.
6. activation: ReLu.
7. optimizer: Adam.

However, other common hyperparameters for ANN models, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of nodes in the output layer, are not provided in the context. Therefore, we cannot give a complete answer to the query.

In summary, the context provides some hyperparameters for the ANN model, but other important hyperparameters are missing. We cannot assume or make up the values, as it might lead to incorrect conclusions or misinterpretations.
