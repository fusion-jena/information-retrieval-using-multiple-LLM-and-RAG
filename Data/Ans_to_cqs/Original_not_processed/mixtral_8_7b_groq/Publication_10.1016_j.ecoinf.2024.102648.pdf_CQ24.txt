Answer:::

The provided context does not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the setting of a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of deep learning models for predicting the incidence of Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD) based on weather data and whitefly population.

In the context, a specific deep learning method, the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), is used and its training accuracy is reported. The MLP is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is composed of multiple layers of nodes or "neurons" and is commonly used for regression and classification tasks.

When training an ANN, randomness can be introduced in several ways, such as the initialization of the weights and biases of the neurons, the order of presentation of the training data, and the selection of mini-batch samples for stochastic gradient descent. These sources of randomness can affect the training process and the generalization performance of the model.

To handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several strategies can be employed. One common approach is to set a fixed random seed value at the beginning of the training process, so that the same sequence of random numbers is generated across different runs of the algorithm. This can help to ensure the reproducibility of the results and to compare the performance of different models or hyperparameter settings.

Another strategy is to use techniques such as cross-validation, ensemble methods, or regularization to reduce the variance and improve the robustness of the model. Cross-validation involves dividing the data into multiple folds and training the model on different subsets of the data, which can help to reduce overfitting and to estimate the generalization error. Ensemble methods, such as bagging or boosting, combine the predictions of multiple models trained on different subsets of the data, which can improve the accuracy and reduce the variance of the model. Regularization techniques, such as L1 or L2 regularization, add a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights and biases, which can help to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization performance of the model.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, several such strategies exist and can be used to improve the reproducibility, robustness, and generalization performance of deep learning models.
