Answer:

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated using three quantitative metrics: UIQM (Unsupervised Image Quality Metric), UCIQE (Unsupervised Color Image Quality Evaluation), and NIQE (Naturalness Image Quality Evaluator). These metrics are used to assess the quality of the images produced by the model.

Additionally, the model's performance is compared with other methods using the same datasets. The datasets used for comparison are C-60, U45, and UCCS. The context provides the UIQM, UCIQE, and NIQE scores for each method on these datasets. This allows for a quantitative comparison of the model's performance with other methods.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of a linear combination of the adversarial loss function Ladv, L1 loss function, and the perceptual loss function Lper. The total loss function is given by the equation Ltotal = Ladv + λ1Lper + λ2L1. This suggests that the model's performance is also being monitored during training by checking the values of these loss functions. 

However, the specific strategy for monitoring the model's performance during training, such as the use of validation sets or early stopping, is not provided in the context.
