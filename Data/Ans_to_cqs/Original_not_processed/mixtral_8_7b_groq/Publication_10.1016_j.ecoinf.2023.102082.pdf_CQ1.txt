Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline for creating a high-resolution Canopy Height Model (CHM) of the Earth, referred to as Lang10m, utilizes Sentinel-2 optical images and a deep learning approach involving convolutional neural networks. The Sentinel-2 images are a type of remote sensing data captured by the European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 satellites. These images provide optical imagery at a high spatial resolution, making them suitable for generating detailed CHMs.

Additionally, the Lang10m model incorporates data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) instrument, which is a lidar system aboard the International Space Station. GEDI data provides information about the vertical structure of the Earth's forests, including canopy height.

In the study, GEDI samples were fused with Sentinel-2 images using a deep learning algorithm to generate a finer spatial resolution CHM. This approach allowed for more spatially precise information about the vegetation structure.

Furthermore, the study mentions other data sources used for related applications. For instance, Duncanson et al. (2022) used biomass density data, Hoffr´en et al. (2023) used forest fuels classification data, and Quir´os et al. (2021) used surface elevation data. However, these data sources are not explicitly mentioned as being used in the Lang10m deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the Lang10m deep learning pipeline for generating a high-resolution CHM primarily uses Sentinel-2 optical images and GEDI lidar data. Other data sources may be used for related applications, but they are not explicitly mentioned as being used in the Lang10m pipeline.
