Answer:::
The provided context does not include information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the methodology and related research regarding the optimization of data structures for machine learning (ML) classification in the context of World Surface Modeling (WSM) using Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite imagery. It describes the data extraction, labeling, classification settings, and experimental design stages of the research but does not mention the deployment platform for the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
