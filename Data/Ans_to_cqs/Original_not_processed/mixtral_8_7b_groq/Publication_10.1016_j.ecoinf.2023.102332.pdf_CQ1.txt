Answer:::

The text does not provide specific information about the deep learning pipeline or the methods used for collecting raw data in that pipeline. However, it does describe the data collection and processing methods used in a study related to hikers' perceptions of landscape features and outdoor physical activities.

In this study, the researchers collected raw data from Wikiloc posts, which are text descriptions of hiking experiences. These posts were in five different languages, so the researchers translated them all into English using DeepL (<https://www.deepl.com>). After translation, they preprocessed the data using natural language processing (NLP) methods in R, primarily using the tidytext and tm packages. The preprocessing steps included tokenization, lemmatization, and removal of English stop words based on a predefined list of common words, as well as removal of words such as the name of the country and towns.

Therefore, while the text does not directly answer the query about the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline, it does provide an example of raw data collection and processing in a different context. In this case, the raw data was collected from publicly available text descriptions on Wikiloc, and processed using NLP methods in R.
