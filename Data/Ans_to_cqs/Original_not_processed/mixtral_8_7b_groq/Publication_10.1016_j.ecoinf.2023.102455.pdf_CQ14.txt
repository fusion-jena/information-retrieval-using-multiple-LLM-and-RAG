Answer:::

The hyperparameters of the model in the study were optimized using the Bayesian optimization method. This method was compared to other optimization methods such as grid search, random search, and trial and error schemes. The Bayesian optimization method was found to accelerate and improve the optimization of hyperparameters.

The Bayesian optimization method works by exploring the hyperparameter space by selecting the next set of hyperparameters to estimate based on past evaluations. This method is more efficient than grid search or random search methods, which evaluate all possible combinations of hyperparameters, or a random subset of combinations, respectively. The Bayesian optimization method, on the other hand, uses a probabilistic model to make informed decisions about which hyperparameters to evaluate next, based on the results of previous evaluations.

In the context of this study, the Bayesian optimization method was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the KELM (kernel extreme learning machine) model and the RVFL (random vector functional link) model. The KELM model has only two hyperparameters, namely γ and C, which makes it more convenient compared to other neural network techniques such as BPNN (backpropagation neural network) which entails the optimization of more than six hyperparameters.

The optimal hyperparameters obtained by the Bayesian optimization scheme for the KELM and RVFL models for one and three days ahead forecasting of streamflow values are presented in Table 3 of the study. The hyperparameters include the kernel parameter γ, the regularization parameter C, and the number of hidden neurons.

In summary, the hyperparameters of the models in this study were optimized using the Bayesian optimization method, which was found to be more efficient and effective than other optimization methods such as grid search or random search. The Bayesian optimization method was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the KELM and RVFL models for one and three days ahead forecasting of streamflow values.
