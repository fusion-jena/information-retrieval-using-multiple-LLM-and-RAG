Answer:::

The provided context does not include information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in machine learning model development, where techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization are used to find the best set of hyperparameters that yield the best model performance.

However, the context does mention the use of a deep learning model for avian diversity monitoring in Kahl et al. (2021), which implies that some hyperparameter optimization technique was used during the development of the BirdNET model. Nonetheless, the specific method used for hyperparameter optimization is not mentioned in the provided text.

Additionally, the context includes references to several studies that use machine learning and deep learning techniques for various applications, such as image recognition (He et al., 2016) and bird species identification (Wood et al., 2022a). However, these studies do not provide details on the hyperparameter optimization techniques used in their model development.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the specific hyperparameter optimization technique used in the study.
