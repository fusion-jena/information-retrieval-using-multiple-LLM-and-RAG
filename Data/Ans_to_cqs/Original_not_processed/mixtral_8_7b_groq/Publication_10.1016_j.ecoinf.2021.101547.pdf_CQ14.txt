Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search are not mentioned. Grid search involves systematically trying out different combinations of hyperparameter values, while random search involves randomly selecting hyperparameter values to try.

However, the context does mention that some training options were set based on a review of published studies involving similar analysis tasks, and then certain settings were refined through trial and error. This suggests that some manual tuning of hyperparameters may have taken place, but it does not provide details about the specific methods used.

Additionally, the context notes that the computationally laborious process of training a deep learning model imposes a practical limit on the extent of trial and error that can be undertaken. This may indicate that more sophisticated hyperparameter optimization techniques were not used due to the time and computational resources required.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, it suggests that some manual tuning may have taken place, but does not provide details about specific methods used.
