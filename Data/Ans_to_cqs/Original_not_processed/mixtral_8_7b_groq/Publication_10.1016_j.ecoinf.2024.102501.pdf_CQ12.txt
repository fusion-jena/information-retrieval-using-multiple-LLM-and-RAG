The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). This information is provided in the paper titled "Predicting dissolved oxygen concentration in river using new advanced machines learning: long-short term memory (LSTM) deep learning" by Heddam et al., 2022b. The paper specifically focuses on using LSTM to predict dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in river water. LSTM is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is capable of learning long-term dependencies, making it suitable for time series data like the one used in this study. The authors compare the performance of LSTM with traditional machine learning methods like Support Vector Regression (SVR) and show that LSTM outperforms SVR in predicting DO concentration.
