Based on the provided context, there is no information about the deployment of a trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the use of various analytical methods and techniques to identify ecological corridors, sources, and bundles in a specific region.

However, I can provide you with a general process that is typically followed to deploy a trained deep learning model:

1. Model Serialization: Once the deep learning model has been trained and validated, it is essential to save the model's architecture and weights so that it can be reused for making predictions on new data. Model serialization involves saving the model as a file that can be loaded later. Popular model serialization formats include HDF5, JSON, and XML.
2. Platform Selection: The next step is to choose a platform for deploying the model. The platform can be a local machine, a cloud server, or an edge device, depending on the use case. The platform should have the necessary hardware and software specifications to run the model efficiently.
3. Model Conversion: Depending on the platform, the model may need to be converted to a format that is compatible with the platform. For example, if the model is trained using TensorFlow, and the platform supports ONNX, then the model needs to be converted to ONNX format.
4. Model Serving: Model serving involves creating an API or a web service that can accept input data and return the model's predictions. Popular model serving frameworks include TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, and Clipper.
5. Model Monitoring: Once the model is deployed, it is essential to monitor its performance and ensure that it is working as expected. Model monitoring involves tracking metrics such as accuracy, latency, and throughput.

Therefore, while the provided context does not provide information on the deployment of a deep learning model, the above steps provide a general idea of the process involved in deploying a trained deep learning model.
