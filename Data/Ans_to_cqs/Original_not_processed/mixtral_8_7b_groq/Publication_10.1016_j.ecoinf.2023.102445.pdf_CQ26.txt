The provided context does not discuss data bias techniques during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide a general overview of some common techniques used to address data bias:

1. **Stratified sampling**: During the splitting of data into training, validation, and testing sets, stratified sampling ensures that the distribution of classes remains similar in each subset. This method is useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

2. **Oversampling**: In oversampling, the minority class is increased by replicating samples. This technique can help the model learn more about the underrepresented class, but it may also lead to overfitting.

3. **Undersampling**: Undersampling involves reducing the majority class to balance the dataset. This method can help prevent overfitting, but it may discard valuable information.

4. **Synthetic data generation**: Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) create new synthetic samples for the minority class based on existing data. This method helps maintain the original data's structure while balancing the classes.

5. **Diverse data collection**: Collecting diverse data from various sources can help reduce bias. This method ensures that the dataset represents the target population better, reducing potential biases.

6. **Data augmentation**: Data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and cropping can help increase the dataset size and improve the model's ability to generalize.

7. **Reweighing classes**: In some cases, assigning different weights to classes during training can help address data bias. This method ensures that the model pays more attention to the underrepresented classes.

These techniques can help reduce data bias during preprocessing and improve the deep learning pipeline's performance. However, the context provided does not discuss any specific bias mitigation techniques.
