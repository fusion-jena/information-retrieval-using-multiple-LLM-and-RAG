Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Hyperparameter optimization is an important step in training machine learning models, and methods such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization are commonly used. However, the text does not mention any of these techniques being used.

The text does mention that a pre-trained model was fine-tuned for hummingbird detection. Fine-tuning involves taking a pre-trained model and continuing to train it on a new dataset, allowing the model to adapt to the new task. During this process, some hyperparameters may be adjusted, such as the learning rate or the number of training steps. However, the text does not provide enough information to determine if or how these hyperparameters were optimized.

Furthermore, the text mentions that a neural network was trained for hummingbird detection using images collected for the purpose of the article. However, it does not provide details about the neural network architecture, the loss function used, or the optimization algorithm. These are all important factors that can affect model performance, and optimizing them can be crucial for achieving good results.

Therefore, while the text provides some information about the model and the training process, it does not provide enough details to answer the query about how the hyperparameters were optimized.
