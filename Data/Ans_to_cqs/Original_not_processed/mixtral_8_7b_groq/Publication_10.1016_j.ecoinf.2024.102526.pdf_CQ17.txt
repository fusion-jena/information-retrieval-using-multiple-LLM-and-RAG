Answer:::
The provided context does not include information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context mainly discusses image capture, data curation, and documentation protocols for ecological imaging, including details about camera settings, image acquisition, and metadata.

However, I can provide a general answer to the query. In deep learning, overfitting is a common issue where the model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization methods are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are:

1. L2 regularization: Also known as weight decay, L2 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the model's weights to the loss function. This penalty term discourages large weight values, which can lead to overfitting.
2. Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the model's activations to zero during training. This prevents the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron, reducing overfitting.

These methods can be used together or separately, depending on the specific deep learning pipeline and the data being used. Other regularization techniques include L1 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation.
