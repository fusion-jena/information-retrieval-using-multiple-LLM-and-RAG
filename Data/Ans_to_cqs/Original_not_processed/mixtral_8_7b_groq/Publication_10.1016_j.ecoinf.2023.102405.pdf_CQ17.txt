Based on the provided context, the text does not explicitly mention the use of regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline of the AODEGRU model. However, there are several techniques used in the training loop of the AODEGRU model that could potentially help mitigate overfitting.

Firstly, the model is trained using mini-batches, which is a common technique to reduce overfitting by providing a more stochastic gradient descent. This method introduces noise into the gradients during the training process, which can help the model generalize better to unseen data.

Secondly, the training data is randomly shuffled at the beginning of each epoch. This technique can help ensure that the model does not overfit to any particular order of the training data, and it can help the model learn more robust features.

Thirdly, the model uses a loss function to calculate the difference between the predicted labels and the true labels. The use of a loss function can help prevent overfitting by providing a measure of how well the model is performing on the training data. This allows for the optimization of the model's parameters to minimize the loss function, which can help the model generalize better to unseen data.

Lastly, the model uses backpropagation to adjust the model's parameters based on the gradients calculated during the training process. This technique can help prevent overfitting by adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the loss function, which can help the model generalize better to unseen data.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization, the techniques mentioned above could potentially help mitigate overfitting in the AODEGRU model. However, it is worth noting that the authors of the study specifically designed the AODEGRU model to address scaling issues in water pollution analysis in aquaculture, and it is possible that they found these regularization methods to be less effective in this particular application.
