I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not contain information about data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. These techniques are commonly used in machine learning to increase the amount and diversity of training data, thereby improving the model's performance. However, the context focuses on the use of the F-UJI tool to evaluate the FAIRness of datasets in various repositories, including Figshare, Zenodo, Dryad, Ag Data Commons, KNB Data Repository, ZALF Open Research Data, AEDA, and CSIRO.
