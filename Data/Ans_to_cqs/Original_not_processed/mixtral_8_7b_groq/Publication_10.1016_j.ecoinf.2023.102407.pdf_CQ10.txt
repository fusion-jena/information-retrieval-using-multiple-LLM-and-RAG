Answer:::

I cannot provide you with the exact code repository link of a deep learning pipeline as it is not specified in the given context. However, the Pham, H., Dai, Z., Xie, Q., Le, Q.V., 2021 article refers to a deep learning method called "Meta Pseudo Labels" in the Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. You can look for the implementation of this method in the conference's proceedings or search for the authors' repositories on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Remember to check the publication date and the compatibility of the code with your requirements before using it.
