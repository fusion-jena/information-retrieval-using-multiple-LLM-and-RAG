Based on the provided context, there is no specific deep learning model mentioned as being used in the pipeline. The text only suggests testing various methods of machine learning or deep neural networks in the future to increase the accuracy of predicting soil moisture at a spoil heap. Therefore, I cannot provide the specific type of deep learning model (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) used in this pipeline.
