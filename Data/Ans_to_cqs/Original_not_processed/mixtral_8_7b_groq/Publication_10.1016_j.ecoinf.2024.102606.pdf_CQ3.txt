Based on the provided context, the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is stated that a new manually annotated dataset was used to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for identifying Collembola.

Annotating data is a crucial step in the development of deep learning models, particularly for supervised learning tasks. This process involves labeling or marking up the data in a way that provides meaningful information to the model during training. There are various data annotation techniques, each with its own use case and level of complexity. Here are some common ones:

1. Image classification: This is the simplest form of annotation where the entire image is labeled with a single class. For instance, an image of a Collembola might be labeled as 'Collembola'.

2. Bounding box annotation: In this technique, a bounding box is drawn around the object of interest in an image. This helps the model to focus on the relevant part of the image and ignore the rest. For example, multiple bounding boxes could be drawn around different Collembola instances in an image.

3. Semantic segmentation: This is a more advanced form of annotation where each pixel in an image is assigned a class label. This provides a more detailed understanding of the object's shape and location. For instance, semantic segmentation could be used to differentiate between the body parts of a Collembola.

4. Instance segmentation: This technique combines bounding box annotation and semantic segmentation. Each instance of an object is segmented and assigned a unique identifier. This is particularly useful when dealing with multiple instances of the same object in an image.

Given the context, it is plausible to assume that at least one of these annotation techniques was used for the Collembola dataset. However, without explicit information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
