Answer: The context does not provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It mentions various models such as LeNet, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, VGG-19, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ResNet152, but it does not specify the computational resources used for training these models.

However, it is common practice to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which is essential for handling the large number of computations involved in training deep neural networks. GPUs have been widely adopted in the field of deep learning to accelerate the training process and reduce the time required to train complex models.

In some cases, specialized hardware such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) may also be used for training deep learning models. TPUs are custom-built Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) developed by Google specifically for machine learning tasks. They are designed to accelerate tensor operations, which are the fundamental operations involved in deep learning models.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models, it is likely that GPUs or specialized hardware like TPUs were used for training these models, given the complexity and computational requirements of these deep learning architectures.
