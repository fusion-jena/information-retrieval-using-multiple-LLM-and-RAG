Answer:::

The provided context does not specify any particular type of deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer being used in the pipeline. Instead, it describes the use of Temporal Information Partitioning Network (TIPNet), which is an information theory-based approach for network generation. This method is used to reveal interactions occurring on hourly to daily time scales over several-day-time windows. The study used post-2016 flux tower data, which was not available, and was therefore constrained to a period spanning two years, from December 2014 to November 2016. The context also highlights that studies employing an information theory-based transfer entropy approach for network generation, with datasets at sub-hourly and sub-daily scales, have consistently provided robust results. However, it does not mention any deep learning models.
