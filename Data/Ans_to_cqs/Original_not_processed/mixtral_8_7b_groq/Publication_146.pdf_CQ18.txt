Answer:::

The model performance during training was monitored using several evaluation metrics, including precision, recall, F1 score, GIoU (Generalized Intersection over Union), and mAP (mean Average Precision). These metrics were calculated at different iteration stages of the model's training, which lasted for 350 epochs. The validation data used for these calculations consisted of 321 image tiles.

The F1 score and mAP score were observed to follow each other closely throughout the training process. The model quickly reached F1 and mAP scores of approximately 0.4 at the beginning, and these scores continued to increase, albeit at a slower rate, as the training progressed. By the end of the training, the model had achieved F1 = 0.530 and mAP = 0.557.

The GIoU score, on the other hand, was seen to be steadily decreasing. This indicated that the model was becoming better at correctly locating targets, as a lower GIoU score implies a more accurate spatial location of the detected objects.

The model's performance was evaluated using Precision, Recall, and F1 scores, which are standard metrics for measuring detection performance. These metrics are based on the classification terms TP (true positive), FP (false positive), and FN (false negative).

Furthermore, the context suggests that the training data consisted of complex situations where data labeling could be challenging. For instance, there were questions regarding the labeling of objects that were not explicitly labeled and the inclusion or exclusion of large pieces of floating ice. These complexities in the training data could have influenced the model's performance and should be taken into account when evaluating the model's detection capabilities.

In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involved the regular calculation of several evaluation metrics at different iteration stages. These metrics provided insights into the model's detection performance and its ability to accurately locate targets. However, the complexities in the training data should also be considered when evaluating the model's performance.
