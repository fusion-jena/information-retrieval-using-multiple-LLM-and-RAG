Based on the provided context, there are no specific details mentioned about the post-processing steps involved immediately after the model training phase for the tree species classification task. However, we can infer some possible post-processing steps based on common practices in similar tasks.

Some possible post-processing steps after model training could be:

1. Metrics calculation: After obtaining the predictions from the model, various evaluation metrics can be calculated, such as overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, and F1-score. These metrics help assess the performance of the model and identify potential issues.
2. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predictions made by a classifier. It can be used to calculate various evaluation metrics. The confusion matrix shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each class.
3. Visualization: Visualizing the predictions and ground truth data can help identify patterns and errors in the model's predictions. This can be done using techniques such as saliency maps, which highlight the regions of the image that the model focused on when making its prediction.
4. Model interpretation: Interpreting the model's predictions can help identify the features that the model is using to make its predictions. This can be done using techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations).

Based on the context provided, we can see that some of these post-processing steps were performed in related work. For example, the research of Dalponte et al. [15] calculated the average classification accuracy using hyperspectral images and LiDAR. Similarly, the research of Ferreira et al. [2] calculated the average classification accuracy using visible/near-infrared bands. However, there is no explicit mention of these post-processing steps being performed immediately after model training.

In summary, while there are no specific details provided about the post-processing steps involved after the model training phase for the tree species classification task, some possible post-processing steps could be metrics calculation, confusion matrix, visualization, and model interpretation.
