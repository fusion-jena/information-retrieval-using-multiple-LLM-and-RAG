The context does not provide specific information about the deep learning frameworks used to build the model. However, it mentions Caffe [34] in the context of fast feature embedding, and it is a deep learning framework. Therefore, it is possible that Caffe was used in building the model. Additionally, the model architecture described in the context is compatible with multiple deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras, since these frameworks provide implementations for convolutional layers, pooling layers, batch normalization, and other operations used in the model.
