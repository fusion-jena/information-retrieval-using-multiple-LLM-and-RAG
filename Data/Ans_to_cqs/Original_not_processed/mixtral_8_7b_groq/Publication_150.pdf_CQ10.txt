Answer:::

Based on the information provided, there is no direct link to a code repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the text. The context focuses on comparing the performance metrics of various deep learning models such as Wide-ResNet101, ResNet101, InceptionV3, and MnasNet-A1.

However, the models and architectures mentioned in the text are well-known and widely used in the deep learning community. Therefore, it is highly likely that the implementations of these models are available in various open-source code repositories.

For instance, Wide-ResNet101 and ResNet101 are implementations of the Residual Network (ResNet) architecture, which was initially proposed by Microsoft Research. The code for these models is available in the official GitHub repository of the deep learning library, PyTorch, at <https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/master/torchvision/models/resnet>.

Similarly, InceptionV3 is an implementation of the Inception architecture, which was initially proposed by Google Research. The code for this model is available in the official TensorFlow repository at <https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/slim/nets/inception>.

MnasNet-A1 is an implementation of the MobileNet architecture, which was initially proposed by the research team at Google Brain. The code for this model is available in the official TensorFlow repository at <https://github.com/tensorflow/tpu/tree/master/models/official/mnasnet>.

Therefore, while there is no direct link to a code repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the text, the models and architectures used in the pipeline are widely available in open-source code repositories.
