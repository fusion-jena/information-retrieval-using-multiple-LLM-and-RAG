Answer:::

The provided context does not specify the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of a deep learning recognition model and a model called Mask R-CNN, but it does not give information about where the data related to these models is stored or deposited. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query. However, it is worth noting that the authors have made efforts to promote deep learning-based methods for researchers without coding expertise, so they might consider making the data publicly available in the future.
