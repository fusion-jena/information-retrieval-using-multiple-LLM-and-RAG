Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of dropout as a regularization method in the deep learning pipeline. Specifically, a dropout rate of 0.2 was applied in the final fully connected (FC) layer during the training of the EF and SN models. Dropout is a technique used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models by randomly dropping out, or "turning off," a certain percentage of neurons during training. This helps to promote independence among the neurons and reduces the likelihood of co-adaptation, where neurons become overly reliant on each other and specialize too much, leading to poor generalization performance.

However, the context does not mention the use of L2 regularization, which is another common regularization method used to prevent overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which can help to reduce overfitting by preventing the model from assigning too much importance to any single feature.

Therefore, while dropout was used as a regularization method in the deep learning pipeline described in the context, L2 regularization was not explicitly mentioned. It's possible that L2 regularization was not used in this case, or that it was used in conjunction with dropout or other regularization methods. Without further information, it's difficult to say for sure.
