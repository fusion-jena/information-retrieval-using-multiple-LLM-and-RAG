Answer:::

The provided context does not contain specific information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of statistical analyses and machine learning algorithms in the context of animal ecology and bioacoustic studies.

In general, deep learning models often incorporate randomness during training, such as the random initialization of model weights or the random shuffling of training data. These sources of randomness can affect the final model's performance and generalizability.

To handle randomness, deep learning practitioners may employ several strategies, such as:

1. **Setting a fixed random seed value**: By setting a fixed seed value, researchers ensure that the same random sequence is generated during each run, making the training process reproducible.
2. **Cross-validation**: Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance and generalizability of machine learning models. By dividing the dataset into multiple folds, researchers can train and test the model on different subsets, reducing the impact of randomness and providing a more robust estimate of the model's performance.
3. **Ensemble methods**: Ensemble methods, such as bagging or boosting, combine multiple models trained on different subsets of the data or with different initializations. These methods can help reduce the impact of randomness and improve the overall performance of the model.
4. **Regularization techniques**: Regularization techniques, such as L1 or L2 regularization, dropout, or early stopping, help prevent overfitting and improve the generalizability of deep learning models. These techniques can help reduce the impact of randomness by limiting the complexity of the model and encouraging the learning of more robust features.

While the provided context does not directly address the question, these strategies are commonly employed in deep learning pipelines to handle randomness and improve model performance and generalizability.
