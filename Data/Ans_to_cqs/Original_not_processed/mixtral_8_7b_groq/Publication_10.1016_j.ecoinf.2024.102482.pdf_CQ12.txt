Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a specific kind of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This choice is motivated by the LSTM model's capability to learn and predict time-series data effectively, as demonstrated in various ecological studies (Dehghani et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023). In this particular application, the LSTM model is utilized to improve the performance of a water quality monitoring system that uses the swimming behavior of C. elegans as an early warning indicator for water pollution.
