Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about specific preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning being applied to the data before training the deep learning model. However, we can infer that some preprocessing might have been done before the model training phase.

The context mentions that they used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for species identification, and CNNs usually require input data in a certain format. For images, this often includes normalizing pixel values to a range between 0 and 1. Additionally, the context suggests that they have a training dataset (T0) and a threshold tuning dataset, which implies that the data has been divided into separate sets for training and threshold tuning. This division is a common preprocessing step in machine learning projects.

In the context, they also mention computing confidence thresholds after the model training phase. This process involves obtaining an output {C(X), S(X)} for each image X in the threshold tuning dataset, where C(X) is the class with the highest classification score S(X). The ground truth Y for each image is also known. This step suggests that the input data (images) have consistent dimensions and formats, which is typically achieved through preprocessing.

However, the context does not provide enough information to give a detailed answer about the preprocessing steps. Preprocessing can include various steps such as normalization, scaling, cleaning, augmentation, and feature extraction, depending on the specific use case and data type.
