Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the raw data used in the deep learning pipeline for ecosystem monitoring is aerial imagery from the year 2012. However, the context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting this imagery data. It can be assumed that the aerial imagery was obtained through methods such as satellite or drone-based surveys, given that such methods are commonly used for collecting large-scale image data in ecological studies. Additionally, the authors mention the use of public datasets in other parts of their study, implying that publicly available aerial imagery datasets could also be a source of raw data. However, without further information, a definitive answer cannot be given regarding the specific data collection methods used for the aerial imagery in this deep learning pipeline.
