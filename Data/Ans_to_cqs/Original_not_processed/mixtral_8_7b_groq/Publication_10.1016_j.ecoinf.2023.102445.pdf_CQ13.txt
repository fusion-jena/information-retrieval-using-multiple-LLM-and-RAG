Answer:::

The deep learning model used in the study employs several hyperparameters to optimize its performance. The learning rate is set to 0.01, which determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. The optimizer utilized is Adam, an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that combines the benefits of AdaGrad and RMSProp.

Additional hyperparameters include a batch size of 16, which determines the number of training examples used in one iteration. The input image resolution is set at 640 Ã— 640, which can influence the model's accuracy and processing time. The number of epochs is specified as 150, representing the number of complete passes through the training dataset.

The depth_scale parameter is assigned a value of 0.33, and the width_scale parameter is set to 0.25. These parameters control the complexity of the network by adjusting the number of layers and the number of channels in each layer, respectively. However, the specific impact of these parameters on the model's performance is not detailed in the provided context.
