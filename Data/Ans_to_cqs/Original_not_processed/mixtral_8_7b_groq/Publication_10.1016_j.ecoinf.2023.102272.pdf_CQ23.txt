Based on the provided context, the following measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model:

1. Diverse dataset: The data used for model training and selection were randomly partitioned into different subsets, including data for training candidate models (At), data for validating candidate models (Av), data for training the selected candidate model (Bt), and validation data to determine the optimal number of epochs to train the selected candidate model (Bv). This partitioning helped to ensure that the model was trained and tested on diverse subsets of the data.
2. Model selection procedure: The model selection procedure involved generating multiple models for each of the four available deep-ANN architecture types and training each one with a small subset of the training data for a few epochs. The accuracy of the candidate models was then compared using a left-out validation data set, and the model with the highest performance was selected for training on the full training data for up to 30 epochs. This process helped to ensure that the selected model was the one with the best performance on the validation data set.
3. Hyperparameter tuning: The context provides a table (Table 3) that lists the parameters tested and values for each classical machine learning model used and each test year. These parameters include Nrounds, max_depth, Eta, Gamma, colsample_bytree, min_child_weight, Subsample, Mtry, Size, Decay, layer1, layer2, layer3, hidden_dropout, and visible_dropout. The fact that these parameters were tested and optimized suggests that the model's performance was improved by tuning these hyperparameters.
4. Use of deep learning models: The deep learning models used in this study include Deep Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (DeepConvLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. These models are known for their ability to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data, which can help to improve the model's generalizability.

Overall, the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model include using a diverse dataset, model selection procedure, hyperparameter tuning, and the use of deep learning models. These measures helped to improve the model's ability to perform well on new, unseen data.
