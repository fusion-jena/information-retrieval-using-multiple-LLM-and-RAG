Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific details about the format of the data used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the pipeline involves processing multivariate marine chemical data, which suggests that the data is likely in a format that can represent multiple variables, such as a CSV file. The context also mentions the use of attention mechanisms to process information flows and capture features from time series data, which further supports the idea that the data is in a format that allows for the representation of temporal dynamics, such as a time series dataset. Ultimately, the exact format of the data used in the deep learning pipeline cannot be definitively determined from the provided context.
