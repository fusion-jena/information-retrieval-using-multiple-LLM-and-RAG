Answer:::

The specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models are not mentioned in the provided contexts. However, they do mention the use of deep learning models in various studies.

In the study by Sun et al. (2016), a new climate productivity model was developed to evaluate the grassland net primary productivity of southern China, but they do not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.

Wang et al. (2007) evaluated cropland suitability for the grain-for-green policy in desertification-affected North China, but they do not mention the use of deep learning models.

Wang et al. (2008) assessed vegetation dynamics impacted by climate change in the southwestern karst region of China, but they used time-series of AVHRR NDVI and AVHRR NPP, not deep learning models.

In the study by Zhang et al. (2019), a novel integration of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning neural network was verified for flood susceptibility mapping, but they do not mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.

Cai et al. (2021) analyzed the evolution of the dry-wet variations since 1834 CE in the LÃ¼liang Mountains, North China and its relationship with the Asian summer monsoon, but they do not mention the use of deep learning models.

Campagnolo et al. (2021) characterized the accuracy of MODIS daily burned area mapping across fire sizes in tropical savannas, but they do not mention the use of deep learning models.

In the study by Chaitanya et al. (2023), the authors proposed a new method for ecological informatics, but they do not mention the use of deep learning models or the specific metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.

Therefore, while deep learning models are used in some of these studies, the specific metrics used to evaluate their performance are not provided in the given contexts. Common metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve.
