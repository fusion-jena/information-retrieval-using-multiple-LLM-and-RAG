Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the specific type of deep learning model used in the described pipelines is not explicitly mentioned. However, there are a few clues that suggest the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in some of the applications.

Firstly, the context mentions the use of deep learning for air quality prediction, where air quality concentration and toxicity levels are modeled using Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets (IT2 FSs). While the model architecture is not specified, CNNs are commonly used for image and signal processing tasks, which are relevant for air quality data.

Secondly, the context mentions the use of deep learning for identifying oestrus and non-oestrus sounds of sows. CNNs have been successfully applied to audio signal processing tasks such as speech recognition and music genre classification. Therefore, it is plausible that CNNs or a similar deep learning architecture is used in this application.

Lastly, the context mentions the use of deep CNN for texture image segmentation in intelligent environments. CNNs are the de-facto standard for computer vision tasks such as image segmentation.

However, it is important to note that the context does not explicitly rule out the use of other deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers. Therefore, while CNNs are a likely choice based on the described applications, the specific deep learning model used in the pipelines cannot be definitively determined from the provided context.
