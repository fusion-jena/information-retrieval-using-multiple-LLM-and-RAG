Answer:::

The provided pieces of context do not contain specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention various sources of data used in different studies.

In the field of natural language processing, the paper "Learning phrase representations using RNN encoderâ€“decoder for statistical machine translation" by Cho et al. (2014) uses a dataset from statistical machine translation. This dataset is likely to have been collected through text corpus analysis and translation tasks.

In the field of ecology, the paper "Characterizing temporal patterns in the swimming activity of Caenorhabditis elegans" by Choi et al. (2012) uses data collected from the swimming activity of Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of nematode. The data was collected using laboratory equipment and techniques for observing and recording the nematode's movement.

The paper "BivalveNet: a hybrid deep neural network for common cockle (Cerastoderma edule) geographical traceability based on shell image analysis" by Concepcion et al. (2023) uses a dataset of cockle shell images for training their deep learning model. The images were likely collected through field surveys and photography.

The paper "Utilization of deep learning tools to map and monitor biological soil crusts" by Dehghani et al. (2024) uses remote sensing data for training their deep learning model. The data was collected through satellite imagery and aerial photography.

In the field of biomonitoring for water quality pollution detection, the paper "A biological monitoring method based on the response behavior of Caenorhabditis elegans to chemicals in water" by Jeong et al. (2019) uses data collected from the response behavior of Caenorhabditis elegans to chemicals in water. The data was collected using laboratory equipment and techniques for exposing the nematode to different chemicals and observing its response.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include text corpus analysis, laboratory observation and recording, field surveys and photography, satellite imagery and aerial photography, and laboratory exposure and observation. These methods are likely to be chosen based on the specific research question and the availability of data.
