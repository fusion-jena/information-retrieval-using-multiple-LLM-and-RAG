Based on the provided context, there is no information about the optimization of hyperparameters for a model. The context discusses the methods and functionality of the NasaWebServiceAPIProvider class, which is used to retrieve data from NASA servers.

The class provides methods for retrieving data, such as `execute_all()`, `execute_many()`, and their asynchronous versions, with various input parameters such as products, bands, dates, and subsets. The `execute_many()` method is used when dealing with a large volume of requests, as it returns a lazy iterator, which improves memory management for data ingestion operations.

However, the context does not mention any methods or techniques for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
