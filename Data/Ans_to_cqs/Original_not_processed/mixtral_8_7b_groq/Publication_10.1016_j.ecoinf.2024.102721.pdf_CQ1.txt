The provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline of the study titled "Forecasting ecological water demand of an arid oasis under a drying climate scenario based on deep learning methods". However, it does mention some studies and techniques that can give us a general idea about the possible data collection methods.

In the context, there are references to various studies that have used remote sensing and geographical data for their analysis. For instance, the Xu-dong Wang et al. study mentions the use of the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) to enhance open water features in remotely sensed imagery (Xu, 2006). Similarly, the Xiang et al. study refers to a rainfall-runoff model with LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence learning, which likely involves the use of meteorological data from sensors or public datasets (Xiang, Z.R., Yan, J., Demir, I., 2020).

Furthermore, the Shen (2004) study on Gaussian processes for machine learning and the Seeger (2004) study on machine learning techniques for ecological informatics suggest the use of public datasets or databases for training and testing deep learning models.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline in the Xu-dong Wang et al. study likely involves the use of remote sensing data, geographical data, and possibly meteorological data from sensors or public datasets. However, the specific methods used for collecting raw data are not explicitly stated in the provided context.
