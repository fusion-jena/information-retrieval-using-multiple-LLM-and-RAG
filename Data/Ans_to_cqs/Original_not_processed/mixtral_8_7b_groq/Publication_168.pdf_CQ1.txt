Based on the provided context, the primary source of raw data for deep learning methods in the context of hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). UAVs are used to collect hyperspectral images, which are then used as input for deep learning models.

In the given references, [4] uses hyperspectral images collected by an airborne imaging spectrometer, while [5] uses hyperspectral images acquired by the Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI). Similarly, [6] uses hyperspectral images collected by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), and [7] uses hyperspectral images acquired by the Reflective Optics System Imaging Spectrometer (ROSIS).

Furthermore, [8] uses hyperspectral images collected by the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO), and [9] uses hyperspectral images acquired by the Hyperspectral Imager Sensor (HYSI). However, the specific method of data collection is not mentioned in these references.

Therefore, it can be inferred that deep learning methods for HSI classification primarily use hyperspectral images collected by various airborne or spaceborne imaging spectrometers mounted on UAVs or other aircraft. However, the context does not provide information on other sources of raw data, such as public datasets or surveys.

In summary,

Answer:::
The primary source of raw data for deep learning methods in HSI classification is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with imaging spectrometers. The specific method of data collection is not explicitly mentioned in the provided references, but it is implied that the data is collected through airborne or spaceborne imaging spectrometers. Other sources of raw data, such as public datasets or surveys, are not mentioned in the context.
