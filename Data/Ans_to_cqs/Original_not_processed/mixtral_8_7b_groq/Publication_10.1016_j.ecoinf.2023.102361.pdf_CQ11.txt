Answer:::

The context provided does not give a direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset used to verify the proposed approach was shared by Jiang et al. (2020) through the Github repository: <https://github.com/zhangchuanyin/weed-datasets>. This repository may contain the necessary data and code for replicating the deep learning pipeline.

Additionally, the context also mentions the use of various deep learning models such as VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet-50. These models are well-known classical architectures, and their code and pre-trained weights are available in various repositories such as Keras and PyTorch.

Therefore, while there is no direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline, the necessary data and code for replicating the pipeline may be available in the aforementioned Github repository or other deep learning model repositories.
