I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not contain information about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context focuses on a study related to the correction methods for sampling bias effects in species distribution modeling and discusses various methods, their parameterization, and performance comparison. However, it does not mention or discuss deep learning or regularization techniques.
