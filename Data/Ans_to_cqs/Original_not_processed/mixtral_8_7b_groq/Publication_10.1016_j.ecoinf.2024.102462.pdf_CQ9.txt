Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The text describes a study that uses deep learning (DL) networks to identify sub-alpine shrub species, and it mentions that the network was trained using a large and accurate dataset with images and their corresponding labels. However, it does not specify where this dataset can be accessed. The context also includes a table (Table 4) that shows the performance of different DL networks on the task of shrub species identification, but it does not provide information about the data repository. Therefore, I cannot answer this query without additional information.
