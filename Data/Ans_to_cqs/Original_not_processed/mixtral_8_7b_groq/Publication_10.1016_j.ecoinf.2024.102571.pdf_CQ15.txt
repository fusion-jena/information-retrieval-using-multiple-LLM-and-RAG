Answer:::

The text provided does not directly mention the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe the use of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for predicting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on population size and GDP. The ANN model is a type of deep learning algorithm.

In the context of training ANN models, optimization techniques are used to minimize the error between the predicted and actual outputs, which is also known as the loss function. Common optimization techniques for deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Momentum, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG), Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam.

Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the ANN model used in the study was trained using a back-propagation algorithm, which is a supervised learning method used to train ANN models. The back-propagation algorithm calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases of the network, and then updates the weights and biases to minimize the loss function.

However, the specific optimization technique used in the study is not mentioned. It is possible that the authors used a basic form of SGD or a more advanced optimization technique such as Adam. Without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific optimization technique used in the study.

In summary, while the text provided does not explicitly mention the optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that a back-propagation algorithm was used to train an ANN model for predicting GHG emissions. The specific optimization technique used in the study is not mentioned.
