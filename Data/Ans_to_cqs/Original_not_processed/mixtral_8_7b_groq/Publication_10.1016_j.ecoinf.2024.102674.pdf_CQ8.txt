Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text describes the methods and techniques used to develop and calibrate the models, such as Random Forests (RFs), Generalized Boosted Models (GBMs), Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, it does not mention where the code for these models is stored or if it is publicly available.

The study cites several R packages, such as "RANDOMFOREST" by Liaw and Wiener (2002), "GBM" by Greenwell et al. (2020), and "NEURALNETTOOLS" by Beck (2018), which were used to implement the models. However, these packages are not equivalent to the entire deep learning pipeline used in the study.

Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information. If the authors have made the code repository available, it may be found on popular platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. However, without further information, it is not possible to determine the location of the code repository.
