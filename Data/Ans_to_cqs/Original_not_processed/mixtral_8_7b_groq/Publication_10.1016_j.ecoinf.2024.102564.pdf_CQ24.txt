Answer:::

While the provided context does not directly discuss deep learning strategies for handling randomness, it does offer insights into how randomness is managed in related machine learning methods, such as Random Forests and Artificial Neural Networks.

Random Forests, an ensemble learning method, combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data, and the final prediction is determined by aggregating the predictions of all trees. This approach helps to reduce overfitting and increase the robustness of the model, even when the number of observations is smaller than the number of variables or the variables are correlated (Breiman, 2001; Nguyen et al., 2019).

Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), computational models inspired by the human brain, have trainable parameters associated with the linear combinations performed by each individual neuron. The network's weights are adjusted during the training process, which can be influenced by randomness, particularly when using techniques like stochastic gradient descent (Domingues et al., 2020; Kantarcioglu et al., 2023).

In the context of deep learning, which is a subset of machine learning and typically involves the use of neural networks with multiple hidden layers, randomness can be employed in several ways during the training process:

1. Initialization of weights: Deep learning models often initialize weights randomly, which can help break symmetry and ensure that different neurons learn different features.
2. Data shuffling: To avoid ordering effects in the data, models may randomly shuffle the dataset before each epoch.
3. Dropout: A regularization technique that randomly drops out, or deactivates, a proportion of neurons during training to prevent overfitting.
4. Batch normalization: This technique normalizes the inputs of each layer, reducing internal covariate shift and making the network more stable. Randomness is introduced by sampling a mini-batch from the training data.

These strategies help manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline, improving model performance and preventing overfitting.
