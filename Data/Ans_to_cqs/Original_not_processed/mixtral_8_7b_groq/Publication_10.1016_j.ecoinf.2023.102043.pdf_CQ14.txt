Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text does not mention any specific techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question. However, it is mentioned that the YAMNet-based classification algorithm is updated on a regular basis with new data in order to improve its performance. This could imply that the model's hyperparameters are being adjusted based on the performance of the model with new data, but the specific method of hyperparameter optimization is not provided.
