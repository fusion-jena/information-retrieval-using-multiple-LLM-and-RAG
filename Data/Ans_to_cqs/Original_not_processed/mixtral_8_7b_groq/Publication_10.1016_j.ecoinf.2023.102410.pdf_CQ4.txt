I don't have the specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for the study you mentioned, as the provided context only discusses data analysis methods related to song variant tracking in animals.

However, I can give you a general overview of common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning:

Data augmentation is a strategy used to increase the diversity of training data by applying various transformations to the existing data. This can help improve the robustness and performance of deep learning models. Some common data augmentation techniques include:

1. Flipping: This involves horizontally flipping images, which can help the model generalize better and be more invariant to the orientation of objects in the image.

2. Rotation: Rotating images by a certain angle can help the model learn to recognize objects at different angles and orientations.

3. Scaling: Changing the scale of images (zooming in or out) can help the model learn to recognize objects at different sizes.

4. Translation: Shifting images horizontally or vertically can help the model learn to recognize objects in different positions within the image.

5. Color jittering: Randomly changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue of images can help the model learn to recognize objects under different lighting conditions.

6. Flipping and rotating text: In NLP, flipping or rotating text can help the model learn to recognize patterns in text regardless of their orientation.

Please note that the specific data augmentation techniques used depend on the problem at hand and the nature of the data. It's essential to evaluate the impact of data augmentation on model performance and ensure that the transformations applied are meaningful and relevant to the task.
