Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. None of the sources mentioned by the context (World Agroforestry Centre databases, Yang et al., 2018, Datta et al. 2021a, 2024) have indicated the use of a deep learning pipeline, nor have they specified a data repository for such a pipeline.

However, it is worth noting that the Datta et al. (2021a) paper presents a land use and land cover (LULC) map of the Junput intertidal mudflat in Medinipur coastal plain, India, using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. While not a deep learning method, it does involve a machine learning approach. The data used in this study might be available upon request from the authors or through the data sources they used, such as composite (SFCC) imagery and Google Earth scenes.

In summary, the context does not provide enough information to determine the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. If the deep learning pipeline was used in any of the provided sources, it was not explicitly mentioned.
