Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of three key data pre-processors (categorify, fillMissing, and normalize) from the fastai library, which are used for mapping categorical columns to distinct categories, replacing null values with column median values, and normalizing continuous columns. However, these pre-processors do not directly address data bias.

Data bias can be addressed during preprocessing through various techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified sampling ensures that the train and test datasets have approximately the same percentage of samples for each target variable. Oversampling and undersampling techniques can be used to adjust the class distribution in the dataset, either by creating more instances of the minority class (oversampling) or reducing instances of the majority class (undersampling). Diverse data collection involves gathering data from various sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population.

Without further information, it is unclear whether any of these techniques were used in the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, we cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
