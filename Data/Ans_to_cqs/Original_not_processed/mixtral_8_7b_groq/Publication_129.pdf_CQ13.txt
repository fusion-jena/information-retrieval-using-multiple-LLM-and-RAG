Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, specifically the Faster R-CNN model for crop pest recognition, are as follows:

1. Optimizer: The optimizer used in the Faster R-CNN model is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a momentum value of 0.9.
2. Learning rate: The initial value of the learning rate is set to 0.001, which decreases to 0.0004 after 40,000 steps.

These hyperparameters are carefully chosen to achieve accurate identification of pests. The training and testing steps are performed to train the model and evaluate its performance.

The learning rate is an essential hyperparameter that controls the size of the steps taken during gradient descent. A high learning rate may cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, while a low learning rate may result in slow convergence. The momentum value in the SGD optimizer helps accelerate learning in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations in the perpendicular direction.

In summary, the Faster R-CNN model for crop pest recognition uses Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a momentum value of 0.9 and an initial learning rate of 0.001, which decreases to 0.0004 after 40,000 steps. These hyperparameters are carefully chosen to achieve accurate identification of pests.
