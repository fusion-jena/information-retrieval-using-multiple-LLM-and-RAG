Answer:

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a technique called k-fold cross-validation. In this method, the entire dataset is divided into k subsets or folds. For each of the k iterations, a single fold is retained as the validation data for testing the model, and the remaining (k-1) folds are used as training data. This way, each data point gets to be in a validation set exactly once. 

In this particular case, the value of k is five. Therefore, five prediction records are generated, each from a different fold. These five records are then averaged together to create a single prediction record. This averaging helps in reducing the variance of the estimate, making it more reliable.

Additionally, the performance of the model is also evaluated on unweighted and category-weighted training classification accuracies, as well as F1-scores for both training and testing datasets. The F1-score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, giving a better measure of the incorrectly classified cases than the simple accuracy.

The confusion matrices for both training and testing datasets are also used to monitor the model performance. The training confusion matrix is not provided in the context, but the test confusion matrix for all 19 sound classes is presented. This matrix gives a clear picture of where the model is making mistakes, helping in identifying the classes that need more attention.

Lastly, the model's performance is also evaluated on specific sound categories. It is observed that the model performs well on larger classes with a higher number of training examples. However, slightly lower testing accuracy scores are seen in categories like background noise, which potentially contain a very faint sound occurrence in one of the other categories. Also, lower scores are seen for smaller classes with a fewer number of training examples, like the squirrel “kuk” and the white-breasted nuthatch call. This further aids in monitoring the model's performance and identifying the areas of improvement.
