Answer:::

The pieces of context provided do not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipelines. However, they do imply the use of image data in some of the studies.

For instance, Krizhevsky et al. (2012) in reference [32] presented a deep convolutional neural network for ImageNet classification, which is a large-scale image recognition dataset. Similarly, GoÃ«au et al. (2016) in reference [33] focused on plant identification using the LifeCLEF 2016 dataset, which also consists of image data.

In the "Experiments and results" section of the provided context, the authors mention herbarium specimens classification, transfer learning across herbarium data, and transfer learning from herbarium data to non-dried plant images. These experiments suggest the use of image data in the deep learning pipeline.

Moreover, the GoogleNet architecture mentioned in Table 1 of the context is a convolutional neural network designed for image classification tasks.

Therefore, while the specific data formats are not explicitly stated, the context implies that image data is used in the deep learning pipelines described.
