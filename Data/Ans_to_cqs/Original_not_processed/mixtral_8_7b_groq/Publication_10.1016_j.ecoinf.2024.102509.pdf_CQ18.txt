Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of a loss function, which is a measure of the difference between the predicted and actual values. In the case of the Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) model used in the study, the loss function is the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted Aboveground Biomass (AGB) and the actual AGB values. The MSE is calculated as the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values.

Moreover, the model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, including the Adjusted Coefficient of Determination (Adjusted R2), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). These metrics are calculated for each of the 28 models developed using different combinations of predictor variables, such as HV, NDVI, and Ïƒ0. The model with the highest Adjusted R2 and lowest MSE, AIC, and BIC is considered the best-performing model.

Furthermore, the study mentions the use of a trial and error approach to determine the optimal number of hidden layers and neurons in the BP-ANN model. This implies that the model performance is continuously monitored during the training process, and adjustments are made to the network's structure to improve its performance.

The study also mentions the use of the 'neuralnet' package of R 4.1.2 software for training multi-layer perceptrons in regression analyses. This package provides various tools for monitoring the model's performance during training, such as plotting the loss function's convergence and visualizing the network's structure.

In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of a loss function, various performance metrics, a trial and error approach to optimize the network's structure, and tools provided by the 'neuralnet' package of R 4.1.2 software.
