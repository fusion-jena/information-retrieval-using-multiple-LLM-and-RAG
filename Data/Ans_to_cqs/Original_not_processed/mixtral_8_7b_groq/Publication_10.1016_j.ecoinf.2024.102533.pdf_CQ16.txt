Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this research. The text focuses on the description of the dataset, the methodology for fish freshness classification, and the use of the elbow method for evaluating the number of classes and their duration.

However, it can be inferred that the training process might be related to the clustering process, where the aim is to automatically classify fish freshness using organoleptic parameters. In this context, the Euclidean distance is used as a metric for the clustering process. It is possible that the training process involves optimizing the clustering performance based on some evaluation metric, but the specific termination criterion is not mentioned.

In some machine learning applications, training is considered complete when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly, or when the model's performance on a separate validation set stops improving. These are common heuristics for determining convergence in training. Nonetheless, the provided context does not contain information specific to these criteria.

Another possibility is that the training process in this research is based on a predetermined number of iterations or epochs, rather than relying on a dynamic termination criterion. This could be the case if the dataset is relatively small or if the computational resources are limited.

In summary, the provided context does not offer explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It can be inferred that the training process is related to the clustering process, but the specific termination criterion is not mentioned.
