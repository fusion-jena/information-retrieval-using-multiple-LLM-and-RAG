The context provided does not explicitly mention the specific techniques used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search. However, it does describe several modifications made to the YOLOv5s model to improve its performance and efficiency.

These modifications include:

1. Replacing the Focus layer with a Stem Block to enhance sequential connectivity for parallel iterations and reduce computational demand.
2. Integrating depth-wise separable convolutions (DWConv) into the C3 blocks for further optimization.
3. Replacing the PANet structure with BiFPN to enhance feature extraction and recognition capabilities.
4. Modifying the loss function from traditional CIoU to Focal-EIoU, addressing class imbalances in datasets.

While these modifications are not hyperparameter optimizations per se, they do represent architectural changes aimed at improving the model's performance and efficiency.

Answer:::
The context does not provide sufficient information to answer this query directly. The described modifications are architectural changes rather than hyperparameter optimization techniques like grid search or random search.
