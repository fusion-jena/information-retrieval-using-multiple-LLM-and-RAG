Answer:::
The text provided does not give explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model in terms of diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the models were fine-tuned using meta-metric learning architectures adapted from EasyFSL, which suggests that some form of cross-validation or stratified splitting may have been used within the EasyFSL framework.

Additionally, the text mentions that the pretrained CNN backbones were trained on the ImageNet database, a large and general dataset, which could potentially contribute to the model's generalizability. However, the text also suggests that using features extracted from models trained on more specific datasets, such as spectrograms of bird sounds, could further improve the model's performance and generalizability.

It is also worth noting that the text mentions that the pretrained DenseNet performed well on the Darksound dataset, but there are no guarantees that it will work as well on other datasets. This implies that the generalizability of the model may be limited, and that it may be necessary to fine-tune the model on other specific datasets in order to ensure its performance.

In summary, while the text does not provide explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it does suggest that cross-validation or stratified splitting may have been used within the EasyFSL framework, and that training on a large and general dataset like ImageNet could contribute to the model's generalizability. However, the text also implies that fine-tuning the model on more specific datasets may be necessary to ensure its performance.
