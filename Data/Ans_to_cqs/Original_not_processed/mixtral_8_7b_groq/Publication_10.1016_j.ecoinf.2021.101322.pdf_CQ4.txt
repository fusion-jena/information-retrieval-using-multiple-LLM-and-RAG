Answer:::

In the deep learning pipeline, the data augmentation techniques applied to the salmon scale image dataset include rotations, flipping by the vertical axis, and vertical shifting. Specifically, images were rotated between 0 and 360 degrees, reflected along the vertical axis, and vertically shifted by up to 5 pixels. Additionally, standard image normalization for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was applied, mapping 8-bit pixel values to floating-point values between 0 and 1. These data augmentation techniques were used to increase the diversity of the training dataset and improve the CNN's ability to generalize to new, unseen images.
