Answer:::
The specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models are not mentioned in the provided context. The text focuses on the comparison of different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures such as VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0 for the classification task. It mentions the use of the Adam optimizer algorithm and a batch size of 10 for model optimization but does not provide information about the deep learning framework. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine which frameworks were used to build the deep learning models.
