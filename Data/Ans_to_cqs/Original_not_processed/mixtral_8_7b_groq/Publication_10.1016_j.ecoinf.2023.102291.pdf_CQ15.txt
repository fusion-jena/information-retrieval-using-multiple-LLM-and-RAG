Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions that the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were implemented using TensorFlow, a popular open-source platform for machine learning. TensorFlow supports various optimization algorithms, including Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, and Adam. However, the specific optimization technique used in this study is not specified.

The study focuses on the development and comparison of customized CNN architectures and transfer learning approaches for detecting humpback whale sounds. The authors mention that they used a transfer learning approach with a model pre-trained on ImageNet, a large-scale image recognition dataset. This approach was compared with custom CNN architectures trained from scratch. The authors evaluated the models based on validation accuracy and precision, but there is no mention of the optimization techniques used.

The training and prediction procedures were executed on Microsoft Azure using the NV12s v3 instance with 12 vCPUs and 112 GB RAM. The CNNs were implemented using TensorFlow and Python 3. The Ubuntu 20.04 operating system was used. The algorithm scripts are available in Supporting Information B, but the optimization techniques are not specified.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
