Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline for BirdNET. However, it does mention the use of diverse data collection in the development of BirdNET, which can help to reduce data bias.

BirdNET is a research project between The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Chemnitz University of Technology that facilitates the automated detection and classification of bird vocalizations from sound recordings using a developed deep neural network (Kahl et al., 2021). The project is able to identify over 3000 bird species (Wood et al., 2021). The context mentions that BirdNET uses a low confidence threshold, which may result in increased recall and false positive rates. This could potentially introduce bias in the model's predictions.

The context does not mention the use of specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling to address data bias during preprocessing. However, it does mention that BirdNET uses a diverse data collection, which can help to reduce data bias. Diverse data collection refers to the practice of collecting data from a wide range of sources, locations, and conditions. This can help to ensure that the model is exposed to a variety of examples and is not biased towards any particular subset of the data.

In addition, there are other papers mentioned in the context that could potentially discuss techniques for addressing data bias in the preprocessing of deep learning pipelines, such as "Parsing birdsong with deep audio embeddings" by Tolkova et al., 2021, "Long-duration, false-colour spectrograms for detecting species in large audio data-sets" by Towsey et al., 2018, "Microphone variability and degradation: implications for monitoring programs employing autonomous recording units" by Turgeon et al., 2017. However, without further information, it is not possible to say for certain whether these papers discuss techniques for addressing data bias.

In summary, the provided context mentions the use of diverse data collection as a way to reduce data bias in BirdNET, but it does not give specific details about the use of techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling to address data bias during preprocessing.
