Answer:::

The hyperparameters of a model, such as the learning rate, batch size, and dropout, are optimized using various techniques to find the optimum selection that can improve the model performance. These techniques include grid search, random search, Hyperband, and Bayesian Optimization. The text focuses on using Hyperband and Bayesian Optimization, which are shown to be superior to other search algorithms available in the Keras Tuner.

Grid search is a hyperparameter optimization technique where the model is trained for every combination of hyperparameters within a predefined range. Although grid search is easy to implement, it can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with a large number of hyperparameters and a wide range of values.

Random search is another hyperparameter optimization technique that involves randomly selecting hyperparameters from a predefined range and training the model using those values. Random search is more efficient than grid search as it requires fewer iterations to find a good set of hyperparameters.

Hyperband is a bandit-based hyperparameter optimization technique that combines early stopping and successive halving to search for the optimum hyperparameters. Hyperband is more efficient than grid search and random search as it discards poorly performing configurations early in the training process.

Bayesian Optimization is a sequential model-based optimization technique that uses a probabilistic model to find the optimum hyperparameters. Bayesian Optimization is more efficient than grid search and random search as it uses the information from previous iterations to inform the search for the optimum hyperparameters.

In the study, the hyperparameters of the EfficientNetV2B0 and MobileNetV2 models were optimized using Hyperband and Bayesian Optimization for the Extinction dataset. The optimum learning rate was determined to be 0.00001 for both models, and the F1-Scores were obtained for the optimal learning rate, a higher value, and a lower value. The results showed that the optimal learning rate found through the hyperparameter optimization provided better model classification performance for the selected models and the dataset.

In summary, hyperparameters of a model can be optimized using various techniques, including grid search, random search, Hyperband, and Bayesian Optimization. The study focuses on using Hyperband and Bayesian Optimization, which are shown to be superior to other search algorithms available in the Keras Tuner. The optimum hyperparameters can significantly improve the model performance, but finding them requires considerable compute resources and time as the hyperparameter search space can be large.
