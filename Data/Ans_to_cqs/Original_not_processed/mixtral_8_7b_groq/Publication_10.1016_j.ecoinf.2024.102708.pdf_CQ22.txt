Answer: The performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using several metrics, including precision, recall, and F-score. Precision is the ratio of true positives (TP) to the total predicted positives, which indicates the model's correctness when predicting positive instances. Recall, also known as sensitivity, is the ratio of true positives to the total actual positives, representing the model's ability to find all positive instances. The F-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between these two metrics.

In addition to these metrics, the uncertainties associated with precision and recall are estimated using the Confidence Interval (CI). The CI is calculated as the metric value plus or minus the z-score times the Standard Error (SE) of the metric. The SEmetric is calculated using the formula: √(Metric × (1 - Metric) / Number Detected) for precision and √(Recall × (1 - Recall) / Ground Truth) for recall.

The results presented in the table show the F-score, standard error of precision, CI for precision, standard error of recall, and CI for recall for each model. The YOLOv5s model has the highest F-score of approximately 85%, indicating a better trade-off between precision and recall than the other models.

Furthermore, the results are presented for each model using the data from both sites combined and split into two different evaluation sites with different backgrounds of rocky shore and mudflats. The models that return the higher number of true positives, the lower number of false negatives, and those that score best on precision and recall are highlighted in bold.

In summary, the performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using precision, recall, and F-score metrics, and the uncertainties associated with these metrics are estimated using the Confidence Interval. The YOLOv5s model has the highest F-score, indicating a better balance between precision and recall than the other models.
