Answer:::

After training the deep learning models using the Keras API, TensorFlow backend, and R programming language on a workstation with NVIDIA GPUs, the next step would typically be to serialize the models and deploy them on a suitable platform for real-world use. However, the provided context does not explicitly mention the steps taken for model serialization or platform selection.

Based on common deep learning practices, we can infer that the models were likely saved using the `save()` or `save_model()` functions provided by Keras. These functions save the model architecture, weights, and optimizer state, allowing for later reuse or deployment.

As for platform selection, the context does not provide enough information to determine where the models were deployed. However, the trained models could be deployed on various platforms, such as web applications, mobile devices, or embedded systems, depending on the specific use case and requirements.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the steps taken for model serialization and platform selection, it can be inferred that the models were saved using Keras functions and could be deployed on various platforms based on the specific use case.
