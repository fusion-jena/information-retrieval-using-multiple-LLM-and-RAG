Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly state the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that "Data will be made available on request." This suggests that the data may not be publicly available in a repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, but can be obtained by making a request to the authors.

The CRediT authorship contribution statement indicates that Zixuan Yin and Zhihao Xu were responsible for data curation, which implies that they worked with the data used in the study. The Acknowledgements section states that the research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32371583), which could be a source of funding for data acquisition or storage.

References to previous works by Aarts, Babenko, Beery, Clune, Okafor, Riffenburgh, and Rose provide a broader context for the use of data in animal research and deep learning applications. However, these references do not provide information on the data repository for the current study.

In summary, while the data used in the study is not publicly available in a repository, it can be obtained by making a request to the authors. The data curation was carried out by Zixuan Yin and Zhihao Xu, and the research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (32371583).
