The performance of the WT-HMM, a deep learning model, is evaluated using several metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 

Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the model's detection and classification by calculating the ratio of correctly classified instances to the total number of instances. It is given by the formula: Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN), where TP represents true positives, TN represents true negatives, FP represents false positives, and FN represents false negatives.

Precision, on the other hand, measures the correctness of positive detections and classifications and helps evaluate the model's ability to avoid false positives. It is calculated as: Precision = TP / (TP + FP).

Recall focuses on the model's ability to detect positive instances and avoid false negatives. It is given by the formula: Recall = TP / (TP + FN).

The F1-score provides a balanced measure of the model's performance, considering both precision and recall. It is calculated as: F1 score = 2* Precision*Recall / (Precision + Recall).

These metrics are used to compare the performance of the WT-HMM with other existing blue whale classification algorithms in the literature. The comparison between recording months provides valuable insights into the tradeoffs associated with dataset size selection. The WT-HMM performs superiorly in the 8 to 20-h dataset size range for both months, suggesting the most suitable range for achieving high accuracy.

Since the classification algorithm involves an element of randomness, such as random initialization of weights in ANN or random sampling during training, the experiments are performed over different runs to help capture the variability introduced by these random factors.

In summary, the performance of the WT-HMM deep learning model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. These metrics are used to compare the model's performance with other algorithms and to determine the most suitable dataset size range for achieving high accuracy.
