Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline described in the context uses image data format as its primary input. There is no mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV.

The images used in this pipeline are obtained from Flickr, a popular photo and video hosting website. These images are of red kites, a bird species of interest. The images are preprocessed and augmented using various techniques such as horizontal flipping, random zoom, and counter-clockwise shear. The images are then normalized to ImageNet mean values and rescaled to have pixel values in the range of [0, 1]. The resulting images are 224 Ã— 244 pixel RGB input tensors.

The preprocessed images are then used to train a deep learning model using the ADAM optimizer and a learning rate of 10. The model is trained for 448 epochs, with each epoch passing over the entire training set using a batch size of 64. The best model is selected based on minimal validation loss, which occurs at epoch 448.

The performance of the red kite model is evaluated based on an independent test set of 2060 images. The test set consists of 950 true positive red kite images, which are identified by both textual and visual analysis.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline described in the context uses image data format as its primary input. The images are preprocessed and augmented before being used to train a deep learning model. The performance of the model is evaluated based on an independent test set of images.
