Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of several metrics and statistical measures. These metrics include AUC (Area Under the Curve), TSS (True Skill Statistics), Kappa, and phi. The AUC measures the model's ability to distinguish between true and false predictions, while TSS, Kappa, and phi evaluate the agreement between the predicted and actual results.

Additionally, the Kruskal-Wallis statistic was employed to determine whether a significant difference in prediction accuracy exists among the classifiers. This test revealed no significant difference in the prediction accuracy of the models (p > 0.05), indicating that they exhibited high consistency in their performance.

Furthermore, the model complexity was evaluated by computing the difference between the AUC (train) and AUC (CV), represented as Δ AUC. This score provides insights into the model's sensitivity to the training data. A lower Δ AUC score indicates that the model is less sensitive to the training data and therefore more robust.

The performance of each model was assessed using a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) design. In this approach, 30% of the forest fire occurrence data was reserved as a validation set, while the remaining 70% was used to train the model. This process was repeated 50 times, resulting in 50 models for each machine learning algorithm. This rigorous validation methodology aimed to ensure the accuracy and reliability of each model's predictive capabilities.

In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of several metrics, statistical measures, and a robust validation methodology. This approach ensures that the models exhibit high consistency in their performance and are not overly sensitive to the training data.
