The text does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It mentions that the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a momentum value of Î¼ = 0.9 was employed to train the model, but it does not mention any methods used for hyperparameter tuning such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
