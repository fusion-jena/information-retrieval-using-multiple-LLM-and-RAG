Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context mentions a model-independent deep learning-based modular counting pipeline for estimating the number of insects in images of colour-changing sticky traps, proposed by Luca Ciampi et al. (Ciampi et al., 2023). However, it does not specify the location of the code repository, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I am unable to provide the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
