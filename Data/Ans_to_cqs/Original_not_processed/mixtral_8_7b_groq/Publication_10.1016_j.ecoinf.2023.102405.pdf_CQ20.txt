Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text focuses mainly on the description of the AODEGRU model architecture, the training process, and the application of the model to water contamination analysis in IoT-enabled aquaculture.

However, it is generally assumed that deep learning models are trained on powerful computational hardware, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), to accelerate the training process due to their ability to perform parallel computations. Therefore, it is plausible to assume that the authors used GPUs, TPUs, or similar hardware for training their deep learning model. Nonetheless, without explicit information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.

Answer::: The provided context does not offer explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It is generally assumed that deep learning models are trained using GPUs, TPUs, or similar hardware, but the text does not confirm this detail.
