Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the Wav2Vec deep learning model include the learning rate and optimizer. Specifically, during the fine-tuning phase of the model, the Adam optimizer is utilized with an initial learning rate of the order 10e-5. This learning rate is appropriate for small weight updates throughout the network during the fine-tuning process. Additionally, other hyperparameters such as the number of epochs and batch size are also chosen as optimal values during the manual fine-tuning process. However, the specific values for these hyperparameters are not provided in the context.
