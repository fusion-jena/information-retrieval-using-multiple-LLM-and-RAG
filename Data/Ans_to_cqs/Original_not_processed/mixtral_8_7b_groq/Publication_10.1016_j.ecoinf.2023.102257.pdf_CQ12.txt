Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used in the context of remote wildlife monitoring for species-level classification and for predicting whether an image is empty. CNNs are a popular type of deep learning model commonly used for image-related tasks due to their ability to effectively process grid-like data, such as images, and extract relevant features. Therefore, it is plausible that CNNs are used in the pipeline, but this is not explicitly confirmed in the given text.
