Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include a learning rate of 0.001, a momentum of 0.9, and a weight decay of 0.0005. The learning rate is a critical parameter that controls how much the weights in the model are updated during training. A learning rate that is too high may cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, while a learning rate that is too low may result in slow convergence. The momentum parameter helps the model maintain some of the updates from the previous iterations, which can help the model converge faster and avoid getting stuck in local minima. The weight decay parameter, also known as L2 regularization, helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function that discourages large weight values.

The Adam optimizer was chosen for this model because it has been shown to yield higher model accuracies than static learning rate algorithms, particularly on relatively small datasets. The Adam optimizer is an adaptive learning rate algorithm that adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on its historical gradient information. This can help the model converge faster and achieve better accuracy than static learning rate algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

The batch size for this model was set to 4 due to limitations in computer memory. The model was trained for a total of 350 epochs, resulting in a total training time of 27 hours. The training was evaluated using the scores precision, recall, F1, GIoU, and mAP, which were calculated from model validation data consisting of 321 image tiles. The F1 score and mAP score were seen to follow each other closely, with the model quickly reaching F1 and mAP scores of ~0.4 and eventually achieving accuracy scores of F1 = 0.530 and mAP = 0.557. The GIoU score was steadily decreasing, indicating that the model was becoming better at correctly locating targets.

Overall, the hyperparameters used in this deep learning model were carefully chosen based on successful implementations of Yolo in remote sensing cases and studies applying Yolo to aerial imagery. The learning rate, momentum, and weight decay parameters were set to the default values of the YoloV3 model, while the Adam optimizer was chosen for its proven usefulness on small datasets. The batch size was set to 4 due to limitations in computer memory, and the model was trained for 350 epochs to achieve high accuracy scores.
