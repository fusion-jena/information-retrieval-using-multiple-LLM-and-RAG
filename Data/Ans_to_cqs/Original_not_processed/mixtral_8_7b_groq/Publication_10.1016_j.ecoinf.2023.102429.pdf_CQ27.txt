Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the deployment of a trained deep learning model. The text discusses various methods used for predicting soil nutrient concentrations, including support vector machines (SVM), partial least-squares regression (PLSR), and other statistical techniques. It also mentions the use of MATLAB and libsvm for training SVM models. However, it does not provide any details about the serialization or platform selection for a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
