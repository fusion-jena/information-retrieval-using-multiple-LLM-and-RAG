Answer: The text provided does not give explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that they used a "custom implementation of the intersection over union metric" and the "overall accuracy of the model" as evaluation metrics. These metrics were computed during the forward pass and were used as performance indicators to optimize the hyperparameters of the model.

Additionally, it is mentioned that the model was trained on high-resolution orthophotos with 20-cm spatial resolution obtained from an aerial survey. The great advantage of these data is that many details can be detected. This suggests that the training data was of high quality, which can contribute to the generalizability of the model.

Furthermore, the text mentions that the model was selected based on its performance on the evaluation metrics while training on fewer epochs. This could imply that early stopping was used as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting, which can also improve the generalizability of the model.

However, without more information, it is not possible to definitively say what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
