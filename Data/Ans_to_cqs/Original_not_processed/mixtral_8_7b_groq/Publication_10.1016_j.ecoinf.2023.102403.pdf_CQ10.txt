Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or any code repository links. The text focuses on the examination and refinement of data repositories related to marine biodiversity, specifically FishBase, GBIF, and OBIS. It discusses the importance of these databases, the challenges they face, and the need for standardization. The methods section describes the process of analyzing the data but does not mention any deep learning pipelines or code repositories. Therefore, I cannot provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline because it is not mentioned in the given context.
