Answer:::

After the model training process, there are several postprocessing steps that can be involved, such as the calculation of various metrics, generating saliency maps, or creating a confusion matrix. However, based on the provided context, the specific postprocessing steps are not explicitly mentioned.

The context does mention that the models were trained using a batch size of 20 images, RMSprop optimizer, mean squared error loss function, and the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) was used to quantify the prediction accuracy. The validation MAE was computed after each epoch, and models were trained until the validation MAE did not further improve and started to diverge from the training MAE, indicating overfitting. The trained model was then applied to the test dataset.

Additionally, the context states that a test dataset was extracted, which was not involved in the training process and served for the independent evaluation of the trained models. The remaining data was split into a training dataset and a validation dataset in a 4:1 ratio. The training dataset was used to train the weights of the CNN model, and the validation dataset indicated the training progress after each full training cycle (epoch).

However, the context does not mention any steps related to generating saliency maps, calculating additional metrics, or creating a confusion matrix. Saliency maps are often used to visualize the regions of the input data that the model considers most important for its predictions. Metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score can be calculated to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predictions made by a classification model, showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

In conclusion, while the provided context outlines the training process and hyperparameters in detail, it does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.
