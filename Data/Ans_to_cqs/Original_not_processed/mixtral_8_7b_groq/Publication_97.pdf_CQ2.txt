Answer:

The provided pieces of context discuss the use of deep learning techniques in image processing and remote sensing applications. Therefore, the primary data format used in these studies is image data.

In the study described in reference [60], the training data for the convolutional neural network (CNN) are generated as batches of size (m, 256, 256, 3), where m is the batch size, and the sub-images have a size of 256 Ã— 256. The batches of mask data have a shape of (20, 256, 256, 1). The satellite images used for training and validation are presented in Table 1, but the table is not provided in the context.

Similarly, in the study described in reference [38], the authors use high-resolution remote sensing data for forest damage assessment using deep learning. They use a dataset of aerial images of forest stands, and the images are preprocessed to extract features such as tree crowns and gaps.

In the study described in reference [39], the authors use high-resolution remote sensing data to assess forest damage using deep learning. They use a dataset of aerial images of forest stands, and the images are preprocessed to extract features such as tree crowns and gaps.

In the study described in reference [37], the authors use convolutional neural networks to uncover ecological patterns. They use a dataset of images of vegetation plots, and the images are preprocessed to extract features such as plant species and communities.

In the study described in reference [36], the authors use deep convolutional neural networks for image classification. They use the ImageNet dataset, which contains over one million images from 1000 categories.

In summary, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipelines discussed in the provided pieces of context is image data. These images are preprocessed to extract features and are used for training and validation of the deep learning models.
