Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the system forks over images to humans for annotation at certain intervals, and these annotated images are used to train a classifier iteratively. This suggests that the process likely involves model serialization, as the model would need to be saved and loaded during the iterative training process. Additionally, the platform for deployment is not specified, but it can be assumed that the system was deployed on a platform capable of running deep learning models, such as a server or cloud-based infrastructure.

In general, when deploying a deep learning model, there are several steps that are typically followed:

1. Model serialization: The trained model is saved to disk in a format that can be loaded and used for inference. This can be done using various libraries and frameworks such as Tensorflow, PyTorch, etc.
2. Platform selection: The platform for deployment is chosen based on the requirements of the application. This could be a local machine, a server, or a cloud-based infrastructure.
3. Model optimization: The model is optimized for the target platform, this can include steps such as quantization, pruning, and compilation.
4. Integration: The model is integrated with the application, this can include steps such as creating an API, or embedding the model in a mobile or embedded device.
5. Monitoring and Maintenance: After deployment, the model's performance is monitored and maintained, this can include steps such as retraining the model, or updating the model with new data.

It is important to note that, the context provided is focused on the training and evaluation of the deep learning model, and not on the deployment of the model. Therefore, it does not mention any of the above steps.
