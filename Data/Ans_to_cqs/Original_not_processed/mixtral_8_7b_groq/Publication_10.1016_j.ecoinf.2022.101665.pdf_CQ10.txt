Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information given about a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link for it, such as a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket link. The context discusses various topics related to above-ground biomass (AGB) predictions, soil organic carbon (OCS), and sampling designs, but it does not mention any deep learning pipeline or its code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
