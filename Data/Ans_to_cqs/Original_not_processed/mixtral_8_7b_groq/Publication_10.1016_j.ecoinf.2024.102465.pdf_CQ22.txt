Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does provide some context regarding the models used and the data processing techniques, which can give us an idea of the possible metrics.

The deep learning model employed in the study is a combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for sentiment analysis, and HRNet for semantic segmentation. These models are used to analyze text data and image data, respectively.

For the LSTM-CNN model, commonly used evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of total predictions. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions. Recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

For the HRNet model, the evaluation metrics could include intersection over union (IoU), pixel accuracy, and mean accuracy. IoU measures the overlap between the predicted and actual segmentation masks. Pixel accuracy measures the proportion of correctly predicted pixels. Mean accuracy is the average of class-wise pixel accuracy.

Moreover, the study uses the pre-trained “ERNIE” model for NLP tasks, which could also have its own set of evaluation metrics.

However, the text does not provide specific information about the evaluation metrics used for these models. Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
