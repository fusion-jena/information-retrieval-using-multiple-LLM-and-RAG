Answer:::

The provided context does not contain specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss various models and techniques used in natural language processing and computational linguistics.

In general, overfitting is a common problem in machine learning where a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are dropout and L2 regularization. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are dropped out during training, which helps prevent over-reliance on any single neuron and encourages the model to learn more robust features. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which helps prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.

While the provided context does not mention these specific regularization methods, it does discuss various models and techniques used in natural language processing and computational linguistics, such as word embeddings, the CBOW algorithm, and pre-trained models. These techniques are often used in deep learning pipelines and can benefit from regularization methods to prevent overfitting.
