The provided pieces of context do not include information about the specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention some datasets that are used in other machine learning and data analysis contexts.

These include:

* Housing dataset, synthetic dataset, etc.
* Email spam filtering text dataset, synthetic dataset, etc.
* Brodatz texture
* Intel Berkeley dataset, de Montfort university robotics dataset, and robotics laboratory data, etc.
* Glutamic acid fermentation process modeling, multivalued (MV) data modeling, synthetic dataset, etc.

It is important to note that the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline can vary depending on the task and the goals of the project. For example, MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits that is commonly used for image classification tasks, while CIFAR is a dataset of natural images that is often used for object recognition. ImageNet is a large-scale dataset of images that is used for a variety of computer vision tasks.

In summary, while the provided pieces of context do not include information about the specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it does mention some other datasets that are used in machine learning and data analysis. The specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline can vary depending on the task and the goals of the project.
