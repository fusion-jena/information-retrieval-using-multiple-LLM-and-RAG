Answer:::

The optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline for action recognition is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). This information is provided in the first piece of context, where it is stated that "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is used as an optimization technique" for training models. No other optimization techniques, such as Adam or RMSprop, are mentioned in the provided context.

Further details about the SGD optimization technique are given in the first piece of context. The learning rate starts at 0.0005, and is decreased every 10 epochs by multiplying it with a factor of γ = 0.1. Warmup iterations for the learning rate are used in the first epoch, with a warmup factor of 1/1000. A momentum of 0.9 and weight decay of 0.0005 are also used. These parameters were found to give the best results in evaluations.

In the 4.4 section, it is mentioned that the three ResNet variants are trained for 40 epochs using SGD with a momentum of 0.9 and a learning rate that is decreased every 10 epochs by multiplying it with a factor of γ = 0.1.

In the SlowFast architecture, SGD is used with a momentum of 0.9, a learning rate that is decreased with a cosine strategy, and a weight decay parameter of 4.

In summary, the optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline for action recognition is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), with various settings for the learning rate, momentum, and weight decay.
