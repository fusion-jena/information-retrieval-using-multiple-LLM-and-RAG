Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. There are references to various papers and methods used in the pipeline, but none of them provide a direct link to a data repository. The context mainly focuses on the methodology used to overcome the limitation of a small amount of labeled images in each category, by exploiting existing deep learning techniques and statistical fundamentals. It also explains how the authors had to explore feature extraction and weighting the relevance of extracted embeddings for their problem, due to the limited dataset. However, it does not provide a link to the data repository used in the study.
