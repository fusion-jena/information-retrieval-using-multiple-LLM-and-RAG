The provided context discusses various aspects of deep learning models and their training, but it does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization as methods to prevent overfitting. However, it does discuss a technique called "transfer learning," which can help reduce overfitting indirectly.

In transfer learning, a model trained on one dataset (dataset A) is re-purposed for another related task on a different dataset (dataset B). This is achieved by initializing the network with the weights learned from dataset A and then fine-tuning it on dataset B. This technique can help reduce overfitting on dataset B, especially when it has limited data, by leveraging the knowledge and feature representations learned from dataset A.

Answer: Based on the provided context, transfer learning is discussed as a method to improve the performance of deep learning models when training data is limited or scarce. However, the context does not explicitly mention dropout or L2 regularization as methods to prevent overfitting.
