Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are no specific details mentioned about post-processing steps such as generating saliency maps or creating confusion matrices. However, it is mentioned that the performance of the red kite model was evaluated based on an independent test set of 2060 images, and the model achieved a training accuracy of 0.899 and a validation accuracy of 0.891.

Additionally, the model's training loss was 0.256, and its validation loss was 0.298. These metrics provide insights into the model's performance, but they do not constitute post-processing steps.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention any post-processing steps, it is possible that the authors calculated additional metrics or performed other analyses that are not described in the provided text. Nonetheless, based on the information given, the post-processing steps mentioned are the calculation of metrics such as accuracy and loss.
