Answer:::

In the proposed dynamic β-VAE formulation, the training process involves monitoring changes in reconstruction and regularization losses. These changes are used to adapt the β value in each epoch using a control algorithm. However, the context does not explicitly mention specific criteria for determining when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau.

Instead, the training of dynamic β-VAE consists of three stages: a warm-up phase, a regularized phase, and a regularization regime. During the warm-up phase, the model learns to reconstruct input data similar to bottleneck autoencoders. In the regularized phase, the dynamic control of β smooths the learned latent space without deterioration in the quality of reconstructions. The regularization regime increases β to encourage smaller intra-class and larger inter-class distances in the clustering loss.

The increase in β is influenced by the reconstruction loss and the regularization loss. The reconstruction loss is compared to the historical minimum, and if it has decreased, the regularization loss increases. Additionally, a change in β is nudged based on the last update to β, allowing it to get out of plateaus of stable reconstruction or regularization regimes.

In summary, the provided context does not explicitly mention validation loss plateau as a criterion for determining when training is complete. Instead, the training process involves three stages, and the dynamic control of β is influenced by the reconstruction loss and the regularization loss. However, it is possible that a validation loss plateau could be used as an additional criterion for determining when training is complete, depending on the specific implementation and use case.
