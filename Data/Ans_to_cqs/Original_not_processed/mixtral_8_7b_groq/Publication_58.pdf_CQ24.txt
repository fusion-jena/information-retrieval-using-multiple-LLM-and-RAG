Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning for land use and land cover (LULC) classification using satellite data. However, it does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value.

However, the context does mention that stochastic gradient descent was used for training the neural networks, which involves a degree of randomness in the selection of data points for each training batch. The learning rate was also adjusted over time, which can help to mitigate the effects of randomness on training.

In addition, the context mentions the use of balanced data sets for training the neural networks, which can help to reduce the impact of randomness on the classification results. Specifically, the "median frequency balancing method" was used to balance the number of pixels per class.

While these strategies do not directly address the issue of randomness in the deep learning pipeline, they can help to improve the stability and reliability of the classification results.

Answer:::

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does discuss the use of stochastic gradient descent, learning rate adjustment, and balanced data sets, which can help to improve the stability and reliability of the classification results.
