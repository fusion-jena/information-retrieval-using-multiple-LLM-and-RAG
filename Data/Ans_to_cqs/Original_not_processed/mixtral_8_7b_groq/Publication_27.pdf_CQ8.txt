The code repository for the deep learning pipeline does not seem to be directly mentioned or provided in the given context. The text contains several strings of characters that could potentially be code or repository names, but they do not correspond to any well-known platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

Additionally, the context includes multiple notices about authorized licensed use and restrictions, which may suggest that the code repository is not publicly available or may require specific permissions to access.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline.
