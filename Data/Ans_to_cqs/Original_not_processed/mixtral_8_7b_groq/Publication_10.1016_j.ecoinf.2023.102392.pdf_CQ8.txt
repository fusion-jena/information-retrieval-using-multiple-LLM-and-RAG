Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context mainly focuses on the results and methodology of the study, which includes the use of the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model for land use/land cover classification and forest type categorization. However, it does not mention where the code for this pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
