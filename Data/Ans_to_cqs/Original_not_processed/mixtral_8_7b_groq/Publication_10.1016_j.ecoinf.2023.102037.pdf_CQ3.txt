Answer:::

In the context provided, there are two main data annotation techniques mentioned in the deep learning pipelines for image classification and object detection of pests: bounding box annotation and dataset splitting with image tiling.

1. Bounding box annotation:
In the study by Wang et al. (2020b), the authors used a deep convolutional neural network for common pests image recognition. They utilized a bounding box annotation technique to label the pests in the images. This method involves drawing a bounding box around the object of interest (in this case, the pests) in the image to define the region of interest. This labeled dataset is then used to train the deep learning model for object detection and classification.

2. Dataset splitting and image tiling:
Another data annotation technique mentioned in the context is dataset splitting and image tiling. Wang et al. (2021a) used this method for their "Pest24" dataset, which consisted of 25,378 annotated images coming from 24 pest species. They split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets for their deep learning pipeline. Additionally, they used image tiling to process the high-resolution images. Image tiling involves dividing high-resolution images into smaller tiles or sections, allowing the deep learning model to process and analyze the images more efficiently.

While not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, other data annotation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines for object detection and image classification include:

3. Polygon annotation:
Polygon annotation involves drawing a polygon around the object of interest in the image. This method is more precise than bounding box annotation, as it can better define the object's shape and outline. Polygon annotation is particularly useful for complex objects or when precise object segmentation is required.

4. Semantic segmentation:
Semantic segmentation is a pixel-wise image annotation technique that classifies each pixel in the image into a specific class or category. This method is useful for dense object detection and image segmentation tasks, where the precise location and boundaries of objects are essential.

5. Landmark annotation:
Landmark annotation involves identifying and labeling key points or landmarks on the object of interest. This method is particularly useful for tasks that require precise object localization or alignment, such as facial recognition or human pose estimation.

In summary, the data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for image classification and object detection of pests include bounding box annotation, polygon annotation, semantic segmentation, and landmark annotation. The provided context specifically mentions bounding box annotation and dataset splitting with image tiling.
