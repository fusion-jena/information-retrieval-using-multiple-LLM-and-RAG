Answer:::

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This information is provided in the context in two separate places, confirming its relevance.

In section 10.2.4, titled "SDM Based on a Convolutional NN Model", it is stated that a convolutional NN (CNN) is used for species distribution modeling. This section provides a general introduction to CNN models and their relevance to the task at hand.

Furthermore, in section 10.3.5, titled "Evaluation Metrics", there is a detailed description of the CNN model used in the study. The CNN is composed of two hidden convolutional layers and one fully connected layer with 200 neurons. The first layer has 64 convolution filters of kernel size (3, 3) and the second layer has 128 convolution filters of kernel size (5, 5). After each convolution layer, batch normalization and ReLU activation are applied. The convolutional layers are followed by average pooling and a flattening operation before the fully connected layer.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used in the pipeline for species distribution modeling.
