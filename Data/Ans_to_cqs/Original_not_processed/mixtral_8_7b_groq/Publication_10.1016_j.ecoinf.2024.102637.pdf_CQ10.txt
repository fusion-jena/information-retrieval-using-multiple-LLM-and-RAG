Answer:::
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text describes a study that proposes a lightweight SIAlex model for bird sound recognition, using AlexNet as the backbone and exploring the potential of shallow networks. However, it does not mention or provide a link to the code repository for this deep learning pipeline.
