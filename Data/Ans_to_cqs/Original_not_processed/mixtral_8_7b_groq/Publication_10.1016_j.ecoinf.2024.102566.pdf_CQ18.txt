Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it is mentioned that a method with low data dependency was used, which integrates forest inventory data with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation. It can be inferred that the model performance was likely monitored using standard techniques such as cross-validation, where a portion of the data is held back and used to test the model's performance on unseen data. Additionally, the context highlights the importance of high-quality training samples and the layout of sampling points for constructing accurate and reliable models for biomass estimation. Therefore, it is possible that the model performance was also monitored by assessing the quality of the training data and the distribution of the sampling points.

Moreover, the study by Morais et al. (2021) mentioned in the context emphasizes the importance of training samples for constructing accurate models for biomass estimation. Therefore, it can be inferred that the model performance was closely monitored during the training phase to ensure that the model was learning from high-quality training samples.

In summary, while there is no explicit information provided in the context about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, it can be inferred that standard techniques such as cross-validation were used, and the quality of the training data and the distribution of the sampling points were closely monitored.
