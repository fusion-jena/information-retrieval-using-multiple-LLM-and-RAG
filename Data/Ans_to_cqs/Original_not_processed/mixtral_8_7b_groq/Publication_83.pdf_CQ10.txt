Answer:

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context consists of several research papers and a figure, which discuss various aspects of deep learning architectures for bird sound classification. However, there is no information about the code repository or implementation details of the models discussed in the papers. Therefore, I am unable to provide you with the requested link.
