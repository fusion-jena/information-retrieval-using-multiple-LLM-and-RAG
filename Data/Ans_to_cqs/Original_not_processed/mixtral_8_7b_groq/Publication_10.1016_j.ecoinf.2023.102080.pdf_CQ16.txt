Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the comparison of different covariate selection procedures (embedded, filter, and random) for species distribution models using Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Generalized Additive Models (GAM), and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. It provides information on the percentage of species for which a given covariate selection procedure led to the top score value, as well as the average computation time for each method.

However, the context does mention that the number of predictors (covariates) used in the models is determined based on the number of occurrences of the species. For example, the number of predictors is set to the ceiling of the log2 of the number of occurrences, resulting in 7 and 14 covariates for species with 100 and 14,000 occurrences, respectively. This suggests that the number of predictors used in the models may be related to the training process, but it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.

In summary, while the context provides information on the comparison of different covariate selection procedures and the relationship between the number of predictors and the number of occurrences, it does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the species distribution models.
