Answer:::

The data format used in the deep learning pipeline in the study by Langenkämper et al. (2019a) is RGB images. Specifically, the images are resized to 224 pixels along the x-axis, preserving their aspect ratio, and then cropped to be square. The RGB values are normalized to the training dataset, ImageNet.

Before feature extraction or classification, pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are designed to expect images in a certain format. For VGG16 and other networks trained on ImageNet, RGB images must be 224 × 224 pixels. The study resizes and crops images to meet this requirement.

The images in each dataset are split into 80% training (including 5-fold cross-validation) and 20% testing subsets. Splits are stratified to preserve the class-ratio.

Therefore, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is RGB images of a specific size and aspect ratio, with normalized RGB values. Other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV are not mentioned in the provided context.
