Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct information available about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context includes two research papers published in Ecological Informatics, authored by S. Zhang et al., along with their CRediT authorship contribution statement and a declaration of competing interest. However, there is no mention of any data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.

The context also includes several references related to remote sensing, vegetation indices, and early detection of plant diseases. Furthermore, there is an acknowledgment of previous work on water status prediction of winter wheat using multi-source data with machine learning. However, none of these references provide information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
