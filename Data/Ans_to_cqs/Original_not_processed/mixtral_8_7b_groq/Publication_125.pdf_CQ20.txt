Answer: The deep learning model is trained using the hardware resources provided by the Google Colab repository. Specifically, it allows access to NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs) to execute Python code through the browser. This is evident in the "5.2. Experimental Set-Up" section, which states that the CNN experiments are conducted using the Google Colab repository, which provides access to GPUs. However, the specific type or model of the GPU used is not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, while we know that GPUs are used, the specific GPU model remains unspecified.
