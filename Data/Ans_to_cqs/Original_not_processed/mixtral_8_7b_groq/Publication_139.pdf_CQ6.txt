The provided context discusses the assembly of a training database for a deep learning model used in sound stimuli classification, but it does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, it does mention that spectrogram images were manually labeled and selected for annotation. This process likely involves some level of cleaning, as only spectrograms with sound stimuli were needed, and many spectrograms with only background noise were discarded.

In addition, the context mentions that the neural network architecture used in this study is similar to those implemented by Ruff et al. (2020) and Sprengel et al. (2016). Ruff et al. (2020) state that they used raw waveform data as input to their model, and Sprengel et al. (2016) mention that they used log-mel spectrograms. Therefore, it can be inferred that log-mel spectrograms or raw waveform data are used as input to the model in this study.

Log-mel spectrograms are a type of spectrogram that uses a logarithmic scale for the mel-frequency bins, which can help to emphasize lower frequency sounds. Before creating a log-mel spectrogram, the audio signal is typically preprocessed by applying a windowing function, such as a Hamming window, and then performing a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to obtain the time-frequency representation of the signal. The resulting spectrogram can then be converted to the mel-frequency scale and log-transformed to create the final log-mel spectrogram.

Raw waveform data, on the other hand, does not require any frequency transformation and can be fed directly into a deep learning model. However, it is still common to apply some level of preprocessing to the waveform data, such as normalization or scaling, to improve model performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, it can be inferred that some level of cleaning was performed during the annotation process. Additionally, based on the similarity of the neural network architecture used in this study to those implemented by Ruff et al. (2020) and Sprengel et al. (2016), it can be inferred that log-mel spectrograms or raw waveform data are used as input to the model, and some level of preprocessing, such as normalization or scaling, may be applied to the waveform data.
