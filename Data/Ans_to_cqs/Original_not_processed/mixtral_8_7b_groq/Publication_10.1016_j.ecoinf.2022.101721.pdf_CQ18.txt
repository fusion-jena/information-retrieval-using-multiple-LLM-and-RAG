Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it does suggest some approaches that could be used to evaluate the model's performance.

Firstly, the context recommends that the classification accuracy of software should not be determined solely through training and testing data sets. Instead, the performance should also be evaluated through the number of correct classifications using real-world examples. This implies that the model's performance should be assessed on unseen, real-world data to ensure its reliability in practical scenarios.

Secondly, the context highlights the importance of including all observations in statistical modeling, rather than excluding them. This approach can affect the reliability of studies, suggesting that the model's performance should be monitored to ensure that it is not being negatively impacted by the exclusion of certain observations.

Lastly, the context mentions the use of Bayesian algorithms, which allow users to interact with the software. This interaction could potentially be used as a strategy to monitor the model's performance during training. Users could provide feedback on the model's predictions, allowing developers to adjust and improve the model as necessary.

In summary, while the specific strategy for monitoring the model's performance during training is not provided, the context suggests several approaches that could be used, such as evaluating the model on real-world data, monitoring the impact of excluded observations, and using Bayesian algorithms to incorporate user feedback.
