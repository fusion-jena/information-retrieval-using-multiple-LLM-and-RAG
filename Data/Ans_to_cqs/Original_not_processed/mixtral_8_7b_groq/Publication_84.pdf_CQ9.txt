Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The article focuses on the development of spectral-phenological features for deep learning to understand Spartina alterniflora invasion, but it does not mention where the data or code for the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
