Answer:::

The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context provided is not explicitly stated. However, based on the sources and the information given, it can be inferred that the training process might be complete when there is a plateau or a minimal improvement in the validation loss.

In the study by Petty, Setterfield, Ferdinands, Barrow (2012), they used a maximum of 500 iterations for their model training. This suggests that they might have used a fixed number of iterations as a stopping criterion. However, this is not an ideal method as it does not consider the performance of the model on unseen data.

On the other hand, the study by Prasai, Schwertner, Mainali, Mathewson, Kafley, Thapa, Adhikari, Medley, Drake (2021) used the Google Earth Engine Python API for land use and land cover classification. Google Earth Engine automatically handles the training and prediction process, but it does not provide information on the specific stopping criterion used.

The Blondel et al. (2011) paper, which introduces the scikit-learn library, mentions various methods for model evaluation, such as cross-validation and the use of a separate test set. However, it does not specify the stopping criterion for training.

In the tables provided (Table A.5 and Table A.6), there is no information related to the stopping criterion for training. These tables only provide the accuracy metrics for the models with different features and window sizes.

Therefore, while it can be inferred that the training might be complete when there is a plateau or minimal improvement in the validation loss, the specific criterion used in the provided context is not explicitly stated.
