Answer:::

The specific deep learning framework used to build the models in the provided studies is not explicitly stated. However, based on the fact that the authors of [Tolkova, I., Chu, B., Hedman, M., Kahl, S., Klinck, H., 2021] have used "deep audio embeddings" and the authors of [Kahl, S., Wood, C.M., Eibl, M., Klinck, H., 2021] have used "BirdNET", both of which are projects that use Python as their primary language, it can be inferred that Python-based deep learning frameworks were used.

Python is a popular language for deep learning due to its simplicity and the availability of powerful libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. TensorFlow is a widely-used open-source library for numerical computation, which allows machine learning at different levels of abstraction. PyTorch, on the other hand, is a popular open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, which is used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing.

Therefore, while the specific deep learning framework used in the studies is not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that either TensorFlow or PyTorch, or possibly both, were used to build the deep learning models in the provided studies.
