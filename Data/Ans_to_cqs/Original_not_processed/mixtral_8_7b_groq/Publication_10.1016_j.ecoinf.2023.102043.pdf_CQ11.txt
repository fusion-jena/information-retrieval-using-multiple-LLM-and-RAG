Answer:::

I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text describes a study involving goat vocalization detection using a deep learning pipeline based on YAMNet, but it does not mention where the data or code for this pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
