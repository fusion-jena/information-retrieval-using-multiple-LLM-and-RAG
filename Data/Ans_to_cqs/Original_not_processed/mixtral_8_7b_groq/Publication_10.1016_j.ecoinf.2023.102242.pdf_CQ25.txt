Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is classification. 

The text mentions the processing of high-resolution remote sensing data, which includes a variety of feature information. Before classification, samples require training, and the representativeness and quantity of these training samples significantly influence the accuracy of the classification models. The study aimed to enhance classification accuracy using feature optimization tools, addressing the challenges of insufficient or excessive training samples. 

Moreover, the text refers to a study by Bai (2020) who encountered challenges during the segmentation process. However, the focus of the current study is on determining the optimal segmentation parameters for feature optimization in the context of classification, rather than segmentation or detection. 

Therefore, based on the given context, the purpose of the deep learning model in this study is classification, with a focus on optimizing training samples and feature information for improved classification accuracy.
