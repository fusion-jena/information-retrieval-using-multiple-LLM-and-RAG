I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided context does not include information about regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context focuses on the use of the kernel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (kNDVI) and the Optimal Parameter-based Geographical Detector (OPGD) for analyzing vegetation growth patterns. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
