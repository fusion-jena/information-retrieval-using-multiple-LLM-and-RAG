Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the data was split for training the deep learning model. The text describes the experimental design, model architecture, and results of ablation experiments for a specific object detection model, but it does not mention the data splitting criteria.

In general, when training deep learning models, it is common to split the data into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to optimize the model's parameters, the validation set is used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

The context does mention that a sequence of 10 ablation experiments were conducted using 10 different network models. However, it does not specify if the same data was used for all the experiments or if the data was split differently for each experiment.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query regarding the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training.
