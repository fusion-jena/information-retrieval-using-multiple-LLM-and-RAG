Answer:::

The text provided does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning to split the data into these three subsets to evaluate the performance of the model and prevent overfitting.

Typically, the data is split into training, validation, and testing sets in an 80-10-10 or 70-15-15 ratio. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

In the context of image classification, the authors use top-k accuracy as the evaluation metric, where k = 1, 5, and 10. This metric measures the proportion of correct matches in the top k predicted matches. The authors use this metric to assess the effectiveness of various techniques in image classification.

Moreover, the authors emphasize the importance of data availability for deep learning research, stating that a lack of data is the greatest challenge and limitation researchers encounter. They have contributed the largest fully labeled snow leopard dataset for deep learning research and encourage other researchers to contribute more datasets to Whiskerbook.org for continuously curating and enhancing the data used to improve the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, while the text does not provide specific details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it highlights the importance of data availability and evaluation metrics in deep learning research.
