Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating that a deep learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer, was used in the pipeline. The context discusses the use of various machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Generalized Boosting regression Model (GBM), and Maximum-Entropy learning (MAXENT). However, it does not mention any deep learning models.

Moreover, the context focuses on the application of these machine learning algorithms in the field of microbiology and geographic information systems, with a particular emphasis on habitat suitability prediction and the use of packages like "sdm," "dismo," "bioclim," and "biomod2" in RStudio. Therefore, it is unlikely that a deep learning model was used in this pipeline, as the context does not suggest the use of such models.
