Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context includes details about the data used, such as the number of samples in the training, validation, and test sets for the Amazon and Cerrado databases, as well as the architecture of the deep learning model used. However, there is no information about where the data and code for the deep learning pipeline are stored and made available for others to access and use. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
