Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the evaluation of machine learning models for predicting the presence of Muntjac deer in Great Britain and Ireland, rather than the training and optimization of deep learning models.

However, it is important to note that Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam are commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning. SGD is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters by taking a single step in the direction of the steepest gradient. Adam, on the other hand, is an adaptive optimization algorithm that adjusts the learning rate for each parameter individually, based on the historical gradient information.

Given that the context does not provide information on the optimization techniques used, it is not possible to answer this query without making assumptions. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query based on the given context.
