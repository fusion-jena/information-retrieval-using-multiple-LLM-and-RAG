Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for bird sound noise reduction include the learning rate and the optimizer. The learning rate is set to 10, and the optimizer used is the Adam optimizer, which was proposed by Kingma and Ba in 2014. The Adam optimizer is a popular choice for deep learning models due to its efficiency and ability to adapt to the learning process.

In addition to the learning rate and optimizer, the model is trained for 50 epochs, and the entire training set is presented in a random order during each epoch. One noisy bird sound signal is used per iteration during the training process.

The experimental setting also specifies that the deep learning environment is based on Python and Tensorflow, with GPU and CUDA support, and is constructed under the Windows operating system. The deep feature loss bird noise reduction network model is trained on an RTX 2080 Ti GPU.

It is important to note that the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model can have a significant impact on the model's performance. The learning rate, in particular, can affect the convergence of the model and the quality of the final results. The choice of optimizer can also impact the training process, as different optimizers have different strengths and weaknesses.

In comparison to other bioacoustics noise reduction algorithms, such as SEGAN, WebRTC, wavelet transform, Wiener filter, and MMSE STSA algorithms, the deep learning model based on deep feature loss and the SEGAN algorithm have higher noise reduction efficiencies. However, the deep learning model is larger in size and more demanding of computational resources, which can affect the execution time on CPUs.

Overall, the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for bird sound noise reduction are carefully chosen to optimize the model's performance and efficiency. The learning rate, optimizer, and training parameters are all important considerations in the training process, and the choice of hardware and comparison to other algorithms can provide insight into the model's strengths and limitations.
