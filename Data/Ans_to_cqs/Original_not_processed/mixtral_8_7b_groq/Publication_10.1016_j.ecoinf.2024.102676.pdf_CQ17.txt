The provided context does not directly discuss the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. However, it does offer insights into missing value imputation techniques that can be used in data preprocessing.

Answer:
Regarding the specific query about regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, the provided context does not contain the required information. Regularization techniques such as dropout, L2 regularization, and others are commonly used in deep learning to reduce overfitting by discouraging overly complex models and promoting generalization.

However, the context does mention the missForest algorithm, a Random Forest-based method for imputing missing values. This method can be applied during data preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline, particularly when dealing with incomplete or imperfect datasets. By imputing missing values, the algorithm can help preserve valuable data and potentially improve the accuracy of predictions when sub-quality data is included.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query about regularization methods for deep learning, it does highlight the importance of data preprocessing techniques like missing value imputation using the missForest algorithm.
