Answer:::

The provided pieces of context do not include information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for camera orientation to subject in satellite and aerial images. The context focuses on the importance of metadata, image and data curation, and sampling protocols in ecological imaging projects.

Optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to minimize the loss function and improve model performance. However, the specific optimization techniques used in the study mentioned in the context are not specified.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
