Answer: I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context consists of an abstract, keywords, and excerpts from an introduction and results section of a paper. However, it does not contain any information about the code repository or its location, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. I would recommend checking the full paper or associated materials for this information.
