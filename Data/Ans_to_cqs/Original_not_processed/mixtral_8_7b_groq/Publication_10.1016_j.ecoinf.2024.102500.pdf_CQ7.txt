Based on the provided context, there is no information about how the data is split for deep learning model training. The text focuses on grid search machine learning models, specifically decision trees, random forest, and gradient boosting models, using fivefold cross-validation for splitting the data into five equal-sized folds. However, there is no mention of deep learning models or the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional context.
