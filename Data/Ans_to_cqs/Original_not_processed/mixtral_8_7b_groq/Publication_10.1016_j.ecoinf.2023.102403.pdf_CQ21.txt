Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix. However, the text does provide information about the data processing steps before model training.

The data processing began with 71,670,596 records from GBIF and OBIS. After several filtering steps, only 820,004 records were retained for the analysis. The filtering criteria included data curation, taxonomic filtering, and deletion of data outside the native range. Each filtering step had a specific purpose and reduced the number of records significantly.

The data curation step, based on Zizka et al. (2020), aimed to ensure the data's quality and accuracy. Taxonomic filtering was then applied to remove any records that did not match the target taxa. Afterward, data outside the native range were deleted to focus on the species' natural habitats.

The context also introduces the concept of Species Richness Indicator (SRI) categories (H, M, L, NR, and IR) and the surface area calculation for each bioregion. However, these processes occur before model training and are not directly related to postprocessing steps.

In summary, the provided context focuses on the data processing steps before model training, such as data curation, taxonomic filtering, and deletion of data outside the native range. There is no explicit information about postprocessing steps, like generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix.
