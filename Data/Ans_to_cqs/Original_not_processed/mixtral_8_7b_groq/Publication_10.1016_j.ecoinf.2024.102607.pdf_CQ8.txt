Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the SSA-TPRF model's deployment on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, which is a nonprofit cloud-computing platform for geospatial analysis. However, it does not specify where the code for this model is hosted.

The context does mention that the GEE platform offers a user-friendly programming interface, which allows users to define, create, and execute custom algorithms tailored to their analytical requirements. This suggests that the code could potentially be shared via the GEE code editor.

The context also discusses various machine learning algorithms used in land use and land cover (LULC) mapping, including support vector machines (SVMs), random forests (RFs), decision trees (DTs), and artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline.

The article abstract and keywords do not provide additional information about the code repository. The keywords include "Google earth engine," "random forest," and "LULC," but not "deep learning" or any reference to a code repository.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot provide a specific location for the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that the code is hosted on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but this information is not provided in the context.
