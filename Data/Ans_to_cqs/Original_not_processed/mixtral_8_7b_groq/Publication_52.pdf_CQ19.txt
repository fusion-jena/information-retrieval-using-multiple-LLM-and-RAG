Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch in the development of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of the Deep Extreme Learning Machine (Deep ELM) and an Online Sequential Multi-layer algorithm combined with a Graph Regularized Extreme Learning Machine Autoencoder. These are machine learning algorithms that are used to build the model, rather than frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. It's possible that these algorithms were implemented using one of those frameworks, but the context does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion.

The Deep ELM algorithm is based on the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) which is a Single-Hidden Layer Feed Forward Neural Network (SLFFNN) with randomly selected input weights and biases in the hidden layer. The SLFFNNs are used in ELMs because of their ability to approach any continuous function and to classify any discontinuous areas. The Deep ELM simulates the functioning of biological brain cells in a most realistic mode, creating the potential for a fully automated configuration of the model with high accuracy classification.

The Graph Regularized Extreme Learning Machine Autoencoder is used in conjunction with the Online Sequential Multi-layer algorithm to optimize the choice of the input layer weights and bias, aiming to achieve a higher level of generalization. This method combines two highly effective machine learning algorithms to solve a multidimensional and complex machine hearing problem.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, it does mention the use of the Deep ELM algorithm and a Graph Regularized Extreme Learning Machine Autoencoder implemented using an Online Sequential Multi-layer algorithm.
