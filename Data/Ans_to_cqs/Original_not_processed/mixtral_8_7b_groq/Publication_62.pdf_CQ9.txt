Answer:::

The data repository for the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The materials and methods section of the text focuses on the analysis of a specific portion of the United States National Herbarium, but it does not specify where the data used in the pipeline is stored or how it can be accessed. The supplementary materials include notebooks used to define and train the unstained/stained and clubmoss/spikemoss CNNs, but these do not appear to be data repositories. It is possible that the data is accessible only to the researchers who conducted the study. If the data repository has been made available, it would be beneficial for the authors to include this information in their materials and methods section or in the supplementary materials for transparency and reproducibility purposes.
