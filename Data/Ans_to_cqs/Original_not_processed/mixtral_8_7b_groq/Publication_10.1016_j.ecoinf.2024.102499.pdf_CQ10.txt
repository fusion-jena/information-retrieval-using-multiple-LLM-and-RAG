Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text only describes the methods and techniques used in the study, such as the NASnet architecture, Faster-rcnn backbone, and the datasets used for training and testing the models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the code repository. However, the study mentions that the models were implemented in Tensorflow2, so it is possible that the code could be found in a Tensorflow-related repository on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. If you are interested in the code, I would recommend contacting the authors of the study for more information.
