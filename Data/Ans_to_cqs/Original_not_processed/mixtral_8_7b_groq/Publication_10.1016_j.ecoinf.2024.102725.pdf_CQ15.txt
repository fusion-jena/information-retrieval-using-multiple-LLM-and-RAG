Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam used in a deep learning pipeline. However, the context does discuss the use of deep learning in the reconstruction of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data.

In the study by Wang et al. (2023), they applied deep learning-enhanced fusion methods for improved NDVI reconstruction and long-term vegetation cover study. They used a deep learning model called Deep Fusion (DF) to fuse NDVI data from different sources and reconstruct a high-quality NDVI time series. However, they do not specify the optimization technique used in training the deep learning model.

In another study by Charizanos and Demirhan (2023), they used a Bayesian neural network to predict wildfire event probability using NDVI data. While they do not explicitly mention the optimization technique used, they do mention that they used the Adam solver for training the Bayesian neural network.

Therefore, while not explicitly mentioned in most of the provided context, optimization techniques such as SGD, Adam, or others are likely used in deep learning pipelines for NDVI time series reconstruction and other applications. The choice of optimization technique may depend on various factors such as the complexity of the model, the size and quality of the data, and the computational resources available.
