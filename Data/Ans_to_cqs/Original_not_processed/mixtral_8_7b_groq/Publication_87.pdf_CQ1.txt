Answer:::

In the context provided, the primary method mentioned for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is the use of camera traps for surveys. Camera traps are sensors that automatically capture images or videos when triggered by motion or heat. In this specific case study, camera traps were used to collect images of a ecological community composed of the Eurasian lynx and its two main preys. These images were then used as input for training deep learning models to identify animal species.

Additionally, it's also mentioned that these models can be trained with public datasets, but in this case study, the authors used a dataset of labelled images for training and validation, and a new dataset of unlabelled images for prediction.

Another method that could be used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines is the use of public datasets, which are available for a wide range of tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and natural language processing. These datasets can be used as-is or can be augmented with additional data to improve model performance.

It's important to note that the choice of data collection method will depend on the specific problem and the available resources. For example, camera traps may be the best option for collecting images of wildlife in their natural habitat, while public datasets may be more suitable for tasks such as image classification or natural language processing.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include surveys using camera traps, sensors and public datasets. The choice of method will depend on the specific problem and the available resources.
