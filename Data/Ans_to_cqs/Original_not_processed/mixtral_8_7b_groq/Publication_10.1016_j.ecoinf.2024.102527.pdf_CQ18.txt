Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves tracking the model's training process on a validation set. The validation set is a separate dataset from the training set, used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model during the training process. Specifically, the loss value of the model on the validation set is monitored, and the training process is stopped when the loss value no longer decreases. This approach is known as early stopping, and it helps to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model performs well on the training set but poorly on new, unseen data.

In addition to early stopping, the model's performance is also evaluated on a test set after the training process has been completed. The test set is another separate dataset that the model has not seen during training. This final evaluation provides an unbiased estimate of the model's performance on new data.

The computing platform used for model training was a Dell PowerEdge C4130 rack server with two Tesla K80 GPUs and 256 GB of memory. The deep learning environment was PyTorch 1.7.1, and the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a momentum value of Î¼ = 0.9 was employed to train the model. Other hyper-parameter settings for model training were provided in Table S.4 of the Supporting Information.

Overall, the strategy for monitoring model performance during training involves using a validation set to prevent overfitting and a test set to provide an unbiased estimate of the model's performance. This approach is combined with early stopping and careful selection of hyper-parameters to ensure the model's performance is accurately evaluated and optimized.
