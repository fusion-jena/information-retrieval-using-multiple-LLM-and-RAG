Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include:

1. Number of epochs: The models were trained for 500 epochs.
2. Initial learning rate: The initial learning rate was 0.01.
3. Weight decay: The weight decay was 0.005.
4. Optimizer: The optimizer used was Adam.
5. Beta1: The value of beta1 for the Adam optimizer was 0.937.
6. Data augmentation: Data augmentation transformations were applied during training to artificially increase the size of the dataset and reduce the risk of overfitting.

These hyperparameters were used for training two versions of Faster R-CNN, namely Faster R-CNN (640) and Faster R-CNN (1280), both of which used Resnet50 as a backbone and had 41 m parameters. These models were pre-trained on ImageNet and used ROI pooling for accurate object classification.

After multiple tests, the 640-version had inconclusive results, and only the 1280 version was used in the benchmark. The mAP Eq. 4 (Mean average precision) was used to analyze the model's performance, which gives a score for the whole model, while the AP (average precision) was used to analyze how good it is at predicting each species.

The models were trained to be reliable enough to be used by experts in real-life conditions, allowing for 5% mistakes in the prediction of each species of interest. The benchmark was created to compare the results of state-of-the-art models of deep learning on this task.

Therefore, these are the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
