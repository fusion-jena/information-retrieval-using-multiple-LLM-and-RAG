Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some techniques mentioned that could be used to indirectly address data bias or improve model performance.

One such technique is batch normalization, which is used in the CNN model described in the context (Nair & Hinton, 2010; Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015). Batch normalization involves normalizing the activations of the neurons in a layer to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This can help to reduce internal covariate shift, which can improve the stability and speed of training. Additionally, the stochastic nature of batch normalization can have a regularization effect, as the model will not rely on neuron activations that have no good effect on prediction. This could potentially help to reduce the impact of data bias, as the model will be less likely to overfit to biased patterns in the training data.

Another technique mentioned in the context is average pooling, which is used in the CNN model to reduce the size of the feature maps produced by the convolutional layers (Dutr√®ve & Robert, 2016). Average pooling involves taking the average of a set of values within a defined kernel, and can help to reduce overfitting by reducing the number of parameters in the model. This could potentially help to reduce the impact of data bias, as the model will be less likely to overfit to biased patterns in the training data.

Finally, the context mentions the importance of diverse data collection in the context of climatology data (Karger et al., 2016). While this is not a preprocessing technique, it highlights the importance of collecting diverse and representative data to avoid bias in the first place.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention techniques such as batch normalization and average pooling that could indirectly help to reduce the impact of data bias. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of diverse data collection to avoid bias in the first place.
