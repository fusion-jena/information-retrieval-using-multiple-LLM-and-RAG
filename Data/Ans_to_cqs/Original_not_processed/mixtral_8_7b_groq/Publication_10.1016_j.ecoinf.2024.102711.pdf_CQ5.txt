Answer:::

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. However, it does mention the use of two AutoML models, AutoGluon and TabPFN, in a study. It also mentions that the dataset used in the study is limited, comprising only 113 data records. TabPFN is noted to be better suited to perform well on such a limited dataset.

In general, the choice of dataset in a deep learning pipeline depends on the specific task and the goals of the project. For image classification tasks, popular datasets include MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 for object recognition, and ImageNet for large-scale image recognition. Other datasets may be used for different tasks, such as speech recognition, natural language processing, or time series forecasting.
