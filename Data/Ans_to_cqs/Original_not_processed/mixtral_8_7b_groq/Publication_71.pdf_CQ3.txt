Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for training the DeepLabV3+ model. However, it can be inferred that some form of image-level annotation was used, as the model is a semantic segmentation model that classifies each pixel in an image into one of several categories.

Semantic segmentation models like DeepLabV3+ differ from other types of image classification models in that they provide a class label for each individual pixel in an image, rather than just classifying the entire image as a whole. This requires a more detailed level of annotation than techniques like bounding box annotation, where a bounding box is drawn around an object of interest in an image.

One possible annotation technique that could have been used for training the DeepLabV3+ model is instance segmentation, which involves not only classifying each pixel in an image, but also distinguishing between different instances of the same class. For example, in an image of a busy street scene, instance segmentation would not only classify each pixel as belonging to a class like "car" or "person", but would also differentiate between different cars and different people.

However, the provided context does not give enough information to definitively say whether instance segmentation or another annotation technique was used. It is possible that the annotation technique used was not specified in the given text, or that it was not relevant to the focus of the paper.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques used for training the DeepLabV3+ model, it can be inferred that some form of image-level annotation was used, and it is possible that instance segmentation or another annotation technique was used.
