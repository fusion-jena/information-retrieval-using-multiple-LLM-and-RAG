Based on the provided context, the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is suggested that more sophisticated methods such as convolutional neural networks (CNN) or deep learning could be explored for automated cattle detection. Therefore, it can be inferred that either a CNN or another type of deep learning model was potentially used or considered for use in the study.

The study by Avots et al. (2022) is cited as having proven the effectiveness of supervised machine learning algorithms for ungulate detection. While this study does not specifically mention the use of deep learning models, it is possible that such models were included in the "supervised machine learning algorithms" category.

Furthermore, the study by Gupta et al. (2021) is cited as relevant research in the field of automated cattle detection using deep learning. However, the specific deep learning model used in their study is not mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, while the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that a CNN or another deep learning model was potentially used or considered for use in the study. Future studies are encouraged to explore the feasibility of using more sophisticated deep learning models for ungulate detection.
