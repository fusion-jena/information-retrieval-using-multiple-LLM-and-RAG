The context provided does not give specific information about how the raw data was collected for the CNN training. However, it can be inferred that the data used is related to anuran calls, and it is collected through audio samples. It can be assumed that these audio samples are collected through field surveys or with the use of specialized sensors. Public datasets related to anuran calls might also be used, but this is not specified in the context.

Anuran calls are the vocalizations made by frogs and toads for communication purposes such as mating, territorial defense, and social interaction. These calls can be used to identify and classify different species of anurans. Therefore, the raw data for this CNN training is likely to be collected through audio recordings of anuran calls in their natural habitats.

These audio samples can be collected through various methods, such as manual recordings using handheld digital recorders or through the use of automated recording devices. Automated recording devices, such as acoustic sensors, can be deployed in the field to continuously record anuran calls over a period of time. These sensors can be programmed to record at specific times of the day or night, when anuran activity is most likely to occur.

Additionally, public datasets related to anuran calls might also be used as raw data for CNN training. These datasets can be obtained from various sources, such as research institutions, government agencies, or online repositories. These datasets can provide a large and diverse set of anuran call recordings, which can be used to train and test the CNN model.

In summary, the raw data for CNN training related to anuran calls is likely to be collected through audio recordings of anuran calls in their natural habitats. These audio samples can be collected through manual recordings or through the use of automated recording devices. Public datasets related to anuran calls might also be used as raw data for CNN training. However, the context provided does not give specific information about how the raw data was collected for the CNN training.
