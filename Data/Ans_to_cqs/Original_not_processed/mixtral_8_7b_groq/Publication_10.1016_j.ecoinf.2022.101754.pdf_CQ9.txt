Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the mentioned research. The context includes several papers and theses related to the estimation of aboveground biomass using machine learning and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data. However, none of them specify the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.

The context includes a paper by Zhang et al. (2019) that compares machine-learning methods for aboveground biomass estimation based on Landsat imagery. Another paper by Xue (2015) discusses the estimation of hardwood forest biomass in mountainous and bottomland environments using LiDAR and machine learning. However, neither of these papers mention the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.

The context also includes a reference to a paper by Ali et al. (2015) that reviews machine learning approaches for biomass and soil moisture retrievals from remote sensing data. While this paper discusses various machine learning methods for biomass estimation, it does not provide information about the data repository for any deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the research related to aboveground biomass estimation.
