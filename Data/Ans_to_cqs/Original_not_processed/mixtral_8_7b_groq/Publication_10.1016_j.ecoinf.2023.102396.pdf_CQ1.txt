The provided context does not directly discuss the deep learning pipeline or the methods used for collecting raw data in this context. However, it does describe a study that analyzes the number of harvested rabbits in Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) in Mississippi using harvest summaries reports published by the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks.

The raw data for this study was obtained from the wildlife harvest summaries of WMAs, which were compiled and published by the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks in three reports from the 1980s to the 2000s. The number of harvested rabbits per hunter day, a capture per unit effort (CPUE) index, was calculated as the total number of reported harvests divided by the total number of hunter days in a WMA for each year.

So, in this specific context, the raw data was collected through surveys, as the hunters reported their harvests to the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks, which then compiled and published the data in the harvest summaries reports.

Therefore,

Answer::: The raw data for the study was collected through surveys, specifically through the reporting of harvests by hunters in Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) in Mississippi. The data was compiled and published by the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks in wildlife harvest summaries reports.
