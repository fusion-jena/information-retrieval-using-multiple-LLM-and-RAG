Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The text focuses on the evaluation of machine learning models for predicting species occurrences using two test datasets and various metrics, such as True Skill Statistic (TSS), Kappa (k), and the 10th percentile training presence.

The training process itself is not discussed in detail, so it is not possible to provide a precise answer to the query. However, it is worth noting that in machine learning, training is often considered complete when the model's performance on a validation set stops improving or when the model begins to overfit the training data. Common techniques to prevent overfitting include early stopping, regularization, and cross-validation.

In summary, the provided context does not offer information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The text focuses on model evaluation metrics and the use of two test datasets for comparing model performance.
