Answer:::
The text does not provide specific information about which deep learning framework was used to build the model. The GoogLeNet architecture, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), was used for the model. However, the text does not mention any specific deep learning framework such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras that was used to implement the GoogLeNet architecture. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
