Based on the provided context, the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. The text focuses on describing various deep learning models, such as LeNet, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet, along with the inception module used in the ICSNet model. It includes details about the architecture of these models, including layers, filters, and activation functions. However, it does not discuss data collection methods.

Data collection methods can vary greatly depending on the specific application or problem being addressed. In some cases, data may be collected through sensors, surveys, or public datasets. For image classification tasks, like those described in the context, raw data might come from public image datasets, such as ImageNet, which was used in the ILSVRC 2012 and 2014 competitions that AlexNet and GoogLeNet won, respectively.

So, while the context provides valuable information about deep learning models, it does not directly answer the query about data collection methods.
