The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does describe the use of a machine learning model, specifically the MLP neural network-Markov chain (MLPnn-MC) model, in a study related to forest carbon sequestration mapping and economic quantification.

In the context of machine learning, randomness can be introduced in various stages of the pipeline, such as data preprocessing, model initialization, and evaluation. One common way to handle randomness is by setting a fixed seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.

In the study described in the context, the MLP neural network is used as a component of the MLPnn-MC model. The MLP neural network is a type of artificial neural network that is commonly used in deep learning applications. The training of MLP neural networks typically involves the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), which is a type of optimization algorithm that uses random sampling to update the model parameters iteratively.

The context provides some details about the MLP neural network used in the study, such as the number of input layer neurons, hidden layer nodes, and output layer neurons. It also mentions the use of a learning rate that decreases over time, as well as the use of a momentum factor. These parameters can affect the training process and the final model performance.

However, the context does not provide information on whether a fixed seed value was used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.

Answer:::
The provided context does not contain information on strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value.
