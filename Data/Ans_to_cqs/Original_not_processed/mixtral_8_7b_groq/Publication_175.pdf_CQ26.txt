Based on the provided context, there are no specific mentions of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some related concepts mentioned, such as training on limited datasets and data augmentation.

In the context of training a deep learning algorithm with a smaller dataset (AT1) and comparing it to a larger dataset (AT0), the authors mentioned the risk of overfitting when using the same image modified multiple times. This suggests that data augmentation, which involves creating modified versions of existing data, can help increase the size and diversity of the training set. However, it does not directly address data bias.

In the context of few-shot learning, the authors discussed the use of raw data instead of augmented data due to the risk of overfitting with very few training samples. This implies that data augmentation may not be as effective or appropriate in few-shot learning scenarios.

There are other techniques commonly used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling. Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subsets (or "strata") based on certain characteristics, such as class labels, and then randomly sampling from each stratum to ensure a balanced representation in the training and testing sets. Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances in underrepresented classes, while undersampling involves decreasing the number of instances in overrepresented classes. These techniques can help ensure that the deep learning model is exposed to a diverse and representative sample of the data during training.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline, there are related concepts mentioned such as training on limited datasets and data augmentation. Other common techniques to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling.
