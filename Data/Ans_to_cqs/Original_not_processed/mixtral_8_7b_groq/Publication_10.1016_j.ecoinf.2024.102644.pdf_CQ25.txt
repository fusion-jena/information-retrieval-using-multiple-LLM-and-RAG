Based on the provided context, there is no deep learning model mentioned or described in the research articles. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific purpose of a deep learning model in this case, such as classification, segmentation, or detection.

The articles do discuss the usage of machine learning models for predicting the potential effects of climate change on animal spatial distribution in a basin. However, these models are not specified as deep learning models. Instead, the authors mention using MaxEnt-based ecological niche models for species distribution modeling.

In summary, the context does not provide enough information to determine the purpose of a deep learning model.
