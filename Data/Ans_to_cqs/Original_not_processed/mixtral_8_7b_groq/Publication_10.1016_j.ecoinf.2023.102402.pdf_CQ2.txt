Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general information about the types of data formats that are commonly used in deep learning.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to model and solve complex problems. Deep learning models can be trained on various types of data, including images, audio, video, and structured data (e.g., CSV files).

For image data, deep learning models typically use multi-dimensional arrays or matrices to represent images. These arrays or matrices contain pixel values that represent the color and intensity of each pixel in the image. Common image file formats used in deep learning include JPEG, PNG, and TIFF.

For audio data, deep learning models typically use one-dimensional arrays or vectors to represent audio signals. These arrays or vectors contain numerical values that represent the amplitude and frequency of the audio signal over time. Common audio file formats used in deep learning include WAV, MP3, and FLAC.

For video data, deep learning models typically use a sequence of frames, where each frame is represented by a multi-dimensional array or matrix. These arrays or matrices contain pixel values that represent the color and intensity of each pixel in the frame. Common video file formats used in deep learning include MP4, AVI, and MOV.

For structured data, deep learning models typically use tabular data represented in CSV or JSON format. These files contain rows and columns of data, where each row represents a data point and each column represents a feature of the data point.

In summary, deep learning models can be trained on various types of data, including images, audio, video, and structured data. The specific data format used in a deep learning pipeline depends on the problem being solved and the type of data available.
