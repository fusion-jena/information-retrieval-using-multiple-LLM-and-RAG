Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning techniques for fish biomass estimation in aquaculture but does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, based on general practices in deep learning, the following preprocessing steps are typically involved before training a deep learning model:

1. Normalization: This step involves scaling the input data to a smaller range, such as [0,1] or mean = 0, standard deviation = 1. Normalization helps to improve the training speed and the final performance of the model.
2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling involves resizing the input data to a specific range or a particular size. This step is especially important when dealing with images or time-series data.
3. Data cleaning: This step involves removing any irrelevant or missing data from the dataset. Deep learning models are sensitive to noise and outliers, so cleaning the data is crucial for obtaining accurate results.
4. Data augmentation: This step involves artificially increasing the size of the dataset by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to the existing data. Data augmentation helps to improve the model's generalization ability and reduces overfitting.
5. Feature extraction: This step involves extracting relevant features from the input data. In the case of images, this could involve extracting color histograms, texture features, or shape descriptors.

In the context of fish biomass estimation, the preprocessing steps may include data cleaning, data augmentation, and feature extraction. For example, the authors in Fernandes et al. (2020) combined computer vision with deep learning to estimate fish biomass. They used a pre-trained deep learning model and fine-tuned it on their dataset. Before training, they may have applied data cleaning and data augmentation techniques to improve the model's performance.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved, it is reasonable to assume that the typical preprocessing steps for deep learning models, such as normalization, scaling, data cleaning, data augmentation, and feature extraction, are applied.
