Answer:::

In the study titled "Automated Conservation Assessment of the Orchidaceae Family using Deep Learning," several preprocessing steps are mentioned before training a deep learning model, known as IUC-NN. These steps include data splitting, validation, and feature engineering.

Firstly, the dataset is randomly split into a training set (90% of the entries) and a test set (10%). Additionally, 20% of the training set is used for validation. To account for the small dataset size, cross-validation is performed by shifting the validation set 5 times. This helps in quantifying the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy.

Before using the neural network for predictions, several feature engineering steps are performed. These include deriving features from digitally available occurrence records, which are grouped into four categories: geographic, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic. The geographic features consist of mean latitude and longitude, longitudinal and latitudinal range, extent of occurrence (EOO), area of occupancy (AOO), number of locations (sensu IUCN), and occurrence records. Climatic features include the mean of 19 bioclim variables. Biome features involve the presence in 14 biomes, while anthropogenic features consist of the mean Human Footprint Index.

Furthermore, a spatial cleaning process is applied to the data, which involves several levels of cleaning: full, medium, and raw. However, the context does not provide specific details about the spatial cleaning process.

Therefore, the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model include data splitting, validation, feature engineering, and spatial cleaning.
