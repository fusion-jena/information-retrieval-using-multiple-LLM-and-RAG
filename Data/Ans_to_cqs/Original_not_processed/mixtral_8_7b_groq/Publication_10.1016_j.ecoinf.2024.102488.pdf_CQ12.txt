Answer:::
The provided context does not specify the use of any type of deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the described pipeline. The models used in the pipeline are mainly ensemble machine learning models, including TKNN, TRF, TAdaBoost, TXGBoost, and TLightGBM, which are combined using a stacking technique with a Random Forest (RF) meta-model. Additionally, the pipeline involves Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) for feature pruning. However, there is no mention of any deep learning models.
