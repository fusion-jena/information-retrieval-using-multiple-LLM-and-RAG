Answer:::

 The code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study is not explicitly provided in the given context. However, it is mentioned that the DeepLabV3+ model with Conditional Random Fields (CRF) was used, and it was taken from the GitHub repository: <https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf>. This repository contains the implementation of DeepLabV3+ with CRF, which was used for semantic segmentation in the study.

 Although the exact pipeline used in the study is not provided, it is likely that the authors built their pipeline based on this DeepLabV3+ implementation. Therefore, while not a direct answer to the query, this GitHub repository is the closest available link to the deep learning pipeline used in the study.
