Answer:::
Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated which deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used to build the model. The context focuses on the paper's subject matter, which is the application of the MaxEnt model in ecological informatics for the Termo-Mediterranean, Supra-Mediterranean, Montane, and Sub-Alpine sectors. It includes information about the maximum iterations with the subsample run type, a 30 random test percentage, and the model's output. However, it does not mention any deep learning frameworks.

Answer::: 
In summary, the provided context does not contain information on the deep learning frameworks used to build the model.
