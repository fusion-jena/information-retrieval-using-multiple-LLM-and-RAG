Answer:

The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as for creating training, test, and validation datasets. However, it does provide some insights into the methods used for image segmentation and classification, which could be relevant for data preprocessing in the context of deep learning.

In the eCognition software, segmentation and classification strategies are used to extract features from remote sensing images. These strategies are still evolving, and there is no consensus on best practices yet. However, machine learning techniques are being increasingly used to automate the classification process. When using machine learning, some level of supervision and validation is still necessary, which could involve splitting the data into training, test, and validation sets.

In the example provided, the Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was used to classify data into 'woody cover' and 'herbaceous cover' classes. The response variable was framed as a number of 1-m by 1-m cells within the 20-m by 20-m cell of the DEM, and the quasi-binomial family was used to account for overdispersion. The data were split into training and test datasets, and the model was trained on the training dataset before being evaluated on the test dataset.

In the context of deep learning, data splitting criteria could include random sampling, stratified sampling, or clustering-based sampling. Random sampling involves selecting data points randomly from the dataset, while stratified sampling involves dividing the dataset into strata based on certain criteria, such as class labels, and then selecting data points randomly from each stratum. Clustering-based sampling involves dividing the dataset into clusters based on certain criteria and then selecting data points from each cluster.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it does provide some insights into the methods used for image segmentation and classification. When using machine learning, some level of supervision and validation is still necessary, which could involve splitting the data into training, test, and validation sets. In the context of deep learning, data splitting criteria could include random sampling, stratified sampling, or clustering-based sampling.
