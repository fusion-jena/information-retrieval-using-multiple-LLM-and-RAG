Answer:::
The deep learning model was built using the Caffe framework. The specific versions or releases of the Caffe framework are not mentioned in the provided context. It is also worth noting that other frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch were not mentioned as being used in the development of this model.

The model is a modified version of GoogleNet, which has several inception modules with batch normalization added after each pooling layer. The model was implemented using the Caffe framework, and a batch size of 16 images was used for each iteration. The learning rate was set to 0.0075, and images of 224x224 resolution were used. Simple crop and resize data augmentation was used with the default settings of Caffe.

Additionally, the model was pre-trained on a big available dataset, such as ImageNet, and then fine-tuned on scarcer domain-specific data, such as herbarium specimens classification. The methodology used for transferring knowledge from one dataset to another involves training the network from scratch on the first dataset, replacing the linear classification layer with a new one for the second dataset, and keeping the other layers unchanged. The network is then trained on the images in the second dataset.

In summary, the deep learning model was built using the Caffe framework, and no other frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch were mentioned as being used.
