The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is common practice to use data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the robustness of deep learning models.

In computer vision tasks, some common data augmentation techniques include:

1. Flipping: This involves flipping the image horizontally or vertically. This can help the model learn invariance to image orientation.
2. Rotating: This involves rotating the image by a certain angle. This can help the model learn to recognize objects in different orientations.
3. Scaling: This involves scaling the image up or down. This can help the model learn to recognize objects at different scales.
4. Translation: This involves shifting the image horizontally or vertically. This can help the model learn to recognize objects in different positions.
5. Color jittering: This involves randomly changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue of the image. This can help the model learn to recognize objects under different lighting conditions.

In the context of the paper, the authors used the Vision Transformer (ViT) and EfficientNet-B7 models for image classification tasks on the FishInTurbidWater dataset. While the paper does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used, it is likely that they used some or all of the above techniques to augment the training data.

Moreover, the paper mentions the use of transfer learning and weak supervision, which can be seen as indirect data augmentation techniques. Transfer learning involves using a pre-trained model on a large dataset and fine-tuning it on a smaller dataset. This can help the model learn features that are useful for a wide range of tasks and improve its performance on the smaller dataset. Weak supervision involves using noisy or incomplete labels for training. This can help the model learn to recognize objects in the presence of label noise or missing labels.

Therefore, while the paper does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used, it is likely that they used common data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, translation, and color jittering, as well as indirect data augmentation techniques such as transfer learning and weak supervision.
