Answer:

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training follows the Bayesian workflow described by Gelman et al. (Gelman et al., 2020). This iterative modeling process involves systematically repeating the cycle of inspecting the outputs of a model, analyzing the effects of the model and its configurations, and adjusting the configurations or switching to another model type according to the observations. 

In this specific context, the models used for training are a Bayesian logistic regression, MLE logistic regression, Bayesian GAM, and random forest. The Bayesian logistic regression and MLE logistic regression represent less flexible models, while the Bayesian GAM and random forest represent more flexible models. By comparing the performance of these model pairs, the strategy allows for a thorough examination of the model's behavior.

For the random forest model, which is the baseline model at a resolution of nine, the model performance is monitored by evaluating the outputs from the component trees and putting them through a majority vote to create a single output. This method is known to be a simple but powerful way of retaining the complex non-linearity of decision trees while avoiding overfitting.

Furthermore, the training area and target prediction area are visualized using a high-resolution grid with centroids approximately 50 km apart globally. This visualization, as depicted in Figure 1, helps in monitoring the model performance by providing a spatial understanding of the model's predictions.

In summary, the strategy to monitor the model performance during training involves an iterative modeling process, comparing model pairs, using a robust baseline model, and visualizing the training area and target prediction area.
