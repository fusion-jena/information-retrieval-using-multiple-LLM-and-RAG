Answer: The deep learning models were built using TensorFlow, as mentioned in the context. Specifically, the Keras API within TensorFlow was used for constructing the models. This is evident from the statement that mentions the use of the TensorFlow, OpenCV-python3, and Keras [38] libraries in the Jupyter Notebook. No other frameworks like PyTorch were mentioned in the provided context.
