Answer:::

The data augmentation techniques applied in the described deep learning pipeline include rotation, zoom, shear, shifting in height and width, brightness adjustment, and horizontal and vertical flipping. 

More specifically, a rotation range of 90 degrees, a zoom and shear range of 20%, a brightness scale between 0.2 to 1.0, and a shift range of 20% in height and width were utilized. Additionally, horizontal and vertical flipping were also implemented. These techniques help in increasing the amount of data available for training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model without acquiring new data, making the model more efficient. The features that are essential for predictions are retained even after rearranging the pixels through horizontal and vertical flipping.
