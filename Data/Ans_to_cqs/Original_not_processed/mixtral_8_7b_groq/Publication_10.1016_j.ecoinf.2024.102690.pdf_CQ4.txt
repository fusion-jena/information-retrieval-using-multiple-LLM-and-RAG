Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the use of the SOFM (Self-Organizing Feature Map) neural network approach for identifying optional ecological sources. It mentions the use of various datasets, such as the CRU dataset, Guangzhou statistical yearbook, and data from the National Earth System Science Data Center, but it does not mention any data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
