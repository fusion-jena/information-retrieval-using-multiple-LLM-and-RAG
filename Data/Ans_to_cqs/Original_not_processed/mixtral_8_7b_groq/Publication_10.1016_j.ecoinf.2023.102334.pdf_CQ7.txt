Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to train the model, where the model learns the underlying patterns in the data. The validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model and prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. The testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

The splitting criteria can vary depending on the dataset's size, the problem's complexity, and the specific use case. A common approach is to split the data into 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. Another approach is to use k-fold cross-validation, where the data is split into k folds, and the model is trained and validated k times, each time with a different fold as the validation set and the remaining k-1 folds as the training set. The final performance is then averaged over the k runs.

In the context of the experiment conducted for deer facial recognition, the model was evaluated on a test set using metrics like accuracy, loss, and a confusion matrix. However, the context does not provide information on how the data was split for training, validation, and testing.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it is common practice to split the data into training, validation, and testing sets. The splitting criteria can vary depending on the dataset's size, the problem's complexity, and the specific use case.
