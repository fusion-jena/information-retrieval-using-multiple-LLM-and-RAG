Based on the provided context, there is no information suggesting that a deep learning model, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer, is used in the pipeline. The context discusses various machine learning algorithms used for land use and land cover (LULC) classification, including support vector machines (SVMs), random forests (RFs), decision trees (DTs), and artificial neural networks (ANNs). However, it does not mention any deep learning models.

The study by Davidson et al. (2020) uses artificial neural networks (ANNs) for crop mapping in Canada, but ANNs are not considered deep learning models as they typically have fewer layers and lack the depth of modern deep learning architectures.

The study by Zhang et al. (2020) introduces a hexagonal random-sampling strategy and a tile model to improve the accuracy of LULC mapping in Madagascar, but it does not mention any deep learning models.

Therefore, based on the given context, it appears that no deep learning models are used in the described pipeline.
