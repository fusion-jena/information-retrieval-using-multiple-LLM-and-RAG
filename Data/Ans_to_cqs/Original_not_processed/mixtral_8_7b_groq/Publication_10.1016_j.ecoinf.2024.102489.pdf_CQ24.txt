The provided context discusses the Random Forest (RF) model, which is a machine learning algorithm that utilizes decision trees and incorporates randomness through the random selection of samples and features. However, the context does not directly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines, such as setting a random seed value.

Deep learning models, like RF, can benefit from introducing randomness during training to improve their performance and avoid overfitting. In the case of deep learning, strategies to handle randomness include:

1. Initializing weights randomly: Neural network weights are typically initialized with random values. This helps break symmetry and ensures that different neurons learn different features during training.

2. Shuffling training data: Deep learning models often benefit from shuffling the training dataset before each epoch. This ensures that the model does not learn patterns from a specific order in the data.

3. Regularization techniques: Techniques like dropout, where randomly selected neurons are "dropped" during training, help prevent overfitting and encourage the model to learn more robust features.

4. Data augmentation: Artificially increasing the size of the training dataset through transformations like rotation, scaling, or flipping can help the model generalize better.

5. Early stopping: Monitoring validation loss during training and stopping the training process early if the loss starts increasing can help prevent overfitting.

While the provided context does not discuss deep learning, it does mention the RF model, which handles randomness through random sampling and feature selection. The strategies mentioned above are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to manage randomness and improve model performance.
