Answer:::

The provided context does not offer direct information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does offer insights into the training phase of the models.

The training phase involved three solvers for the networks: Adam, SGDM, and RMSProp. These were used with three different input time series lengths: 3 days, 5 days, and 7 days. The models used in the training phase were CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM. The performance of each model was evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) in units of Î¼g/L.

As for the deployment phase, it can be inferred that the best-performing model, CNN-LSTM, was used for the algal blooms forecast in the Zhoushan fishery. However, the specifics of how this model was deployed, such as model serialization or platform selection, are not provided in the context.

In general, deploying a deep learning model involves several steps, including:

1. Model Serialization: This involves saving the trained model in a format that can be loaded later. This could be in the form of a .h5 file for Keras models, a .pth file for PyTorch models, or an .onnx file for ONNX models.

2. Platform Selection: This involves choosing the hardware and software platform where the model will be deployed. This could be a local machine, a cloud server, or an edge device. The choice of platform depends on the requirements of the application, such as latency, throughput, and cost.

3. Model Serving: This involves integrating the model into a server or an application. This could be done using a model server like TensorFlow Serving or TorchServe, or by integrating the model directly into an application using a deep learning library or framework.

4. Model Monitoring: This involves monitoring the performance of the model in production. This could involve tracking metrics like accuracy, latency, and throughput, as well as monitoring the model for drift and bias.

Without more specific information from the context, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
