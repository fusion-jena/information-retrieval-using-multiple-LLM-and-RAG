Answer:::
The provided context discusses a study related to carbon sources and sinks, but it does not explicitly mention the deep learning pipeline or the methods used for collecting raw data. However, it does mention that "half-hour temporal resolution flux tower data" was used in the study. Flux towers are tall masts equipped with sensors that measure various environmental variables such as wind speed, air temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide and water vapor concentrations (Oikawa et al., 2017). Therefore, it can be inferred that sensors were used to collect raw data in this study.

Additionally, the CRediT authorship contribution statement mentions "Data curation" as one of the contributions made by the authors. Data curation involves the cleaning, transforming, and maintaining of data to make it ready for analysis (University of Edinburgh, n.d.). This suggests that the raw data collected by the sensors was processed and cleaned before being used in the study.

It is important to note that while the context provides information about the data used in the study, it does not specify whether the data was collected specifically for this study or if it was obtained from a public dataset. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed whether public datasets or surveys were used in this study.
