Answer:::
The provided article does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps applied after model training. However, it discusses some relevant topics such as model optimization, monitoring Procapra przewalskii using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), and applying the Kalman Filter (KF) for object tracking and identification.

In the context of this article, the postprocessing steps could potentially include:

1. Metrics calculation: After training the detection model, it is essential to evaluate its performance using various metrics. Commonly used metrics for object detection include Precision, Recall, Intersection over Union (IoU), and Average Precision (AP). These metrics can help assess the accuracy and efficiency of the model in detecting and tracking Procapra przewalskii.

2. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model. It can be used to calculate Precision, Recall, and F1-score. In the context of this article, a confusion matrix could be used to assess the performance of the model in distinguishing Procapra przewalskii from other species or objects in the environment.

3. Saliency maps: Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the regions of an image that are most important for a model's prediction. In the context of this article, saliency maps could be used to understand which features of Procapra przewalskii the model is focusing on for detection and tracking.

4. Kalman Filter (KF) postprocessing: The KF is used for object tracking and prediction. After applying the KF, postprocessing steps may include smoothing the trajectories of the detected objects, filtering out false positives or negatives, and analyzing the transition and observation matrices to understand the behavior of Procapra przewalskii.

It is important to note that the specific postprocessing steps would depend on the objectives and requirements of the monitoring and conservation project.
