The text provided does not give detailed information on the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. However, it does offer some context about the model's creation and data preparation that can be inferred.

The model is a classification dendrogram generated using the FIT pairwise comparison model, trained on 44 trails from captive Amur tigers. The training process was iterated multiple times to minimize misclassifications, resulting in a model with 100% accuracy in predicting the captive tigers. This algorithm was then used to classify trails from free-ranging Amur tigers of unknown identity.

Before the model training, data validation was performed to determine the optimal size for the training and test sets. This step is crucial for the model's performance in real-world applications.

The model was used to classify trails collected from free-ranging Amur tigers. Each trail was formed by sub-trails where more than 10 footprints existed. For example, the text mentions that using the 25 left hind footprints from trail MW09, four sub-trails were derived.

However, the text does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or how the model was deployed for the field application in Northeast China. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to this query based on the given context.
