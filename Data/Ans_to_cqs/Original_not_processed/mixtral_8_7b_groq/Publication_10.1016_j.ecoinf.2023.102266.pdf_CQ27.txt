Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. The text focuses on the development and application of a wildfire spread prediction model, which utilizes a Monte Carlo method and stochasticity, rather than a deep learning model.

However, the text does mention the use of machine learning tools to improve the model, which could potentially include deep learning techniques. It is possible that a deep learning model was used as part of the machine learning tools mentioned, but the context does not provide information on the specifics of the deep learning model deployment process, such as model serialization or platform selection.

Therefore, I cannot provide a complete answer to the query based on the given context.
