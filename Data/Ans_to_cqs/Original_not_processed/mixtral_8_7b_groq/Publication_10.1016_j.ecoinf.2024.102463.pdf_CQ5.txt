Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for reconstructing caesium-137 chronics particulate concentration in rivers are not explicitly mentioned. However, the study does mention that they used data from three monitoring stations, one on the Rh√¥ne River and two on the Loire River, all of them downstream nuclear industries.

It is common in machine learning and deep learning studies to use publicly available datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet for benchmarking and comparing the performance of different models. However, in this specific study, the authors used a dataset that is not publicly available, but rather specific to their research question and context.

The study uses an encoder-decoder neural network, "Hierarchical Attention-Based Recurrent Highway Networks" (HRHN), which is known for its ability to extract the most relevant temporal and spatial information from the databases. The HRHN model is trained on the river monitoring data, which includes measurements of caesium-137 concentrations over time at the three monitoring stations.

The hyperparameter tuning method used in the study is Hyperband, which is a bandit-based approach for hyperparameter optimization. Hyperband works by exploring several configurations in parallel while allocating more training resources to promising configurations. This enables a more efficient search of the hyperparameter space, particularly when computational resources are limited.

In summary, while the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for this study are not explicitly mentioned, it is clear that the study uses river monitoring data from three stations downstream of nuclear industries. The study uses the HRHN model and Hyperband for hyperparameter tuning.
