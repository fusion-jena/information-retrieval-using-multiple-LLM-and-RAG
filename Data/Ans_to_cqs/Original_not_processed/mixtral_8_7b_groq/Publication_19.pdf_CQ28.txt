Answer: The provided context does not give information about which cloud platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the inference is done on the edge using a Raspberry Pi (RPi). Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was not deployed on a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Instead, the model is running locally on the Raspberry Pi.
