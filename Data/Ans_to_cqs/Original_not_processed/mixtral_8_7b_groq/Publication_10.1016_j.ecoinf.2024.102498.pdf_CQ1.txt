The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of satellite imagery in the context of land use and land cover (LULC) classification.

In the field of remote sensing, satellite imagery is a common source of data for training deep learning models. Satellite sensors capture images of the Earth's surface, which can then be used to extract features and train models for various applications, such as LULC classification. For example, the study by Javad et al. (2019) used Google Earth Engine to create a wetland inventory in Canada, while the study by Anjos et al. (2021) used remote sensing data to assess climatic guidelines and urban planning in Brazil.

In addition to satellite imagery, other sources of data for deep learning in remote sensing may include aerial photography, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, and hyperspectral imaging. These data sources can provide additional information and help improve the accuracy of deep learning models for LULC classification and other applications.

It is also possible to use public datasets for deep learning in remote sensing. For example, the study by Belgiu and Dragut (2016) used a public dataset of LULC classes to train a random forest model for classifying land cover types. Public datasets can be a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners, as they provide a large and diverse set of data that can be used to train and test deep learning models.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest that satellite imagery and other remote sensing data are commonly used in this field. Public datasets may also be a valuable resource for training and testing deep learning models.
