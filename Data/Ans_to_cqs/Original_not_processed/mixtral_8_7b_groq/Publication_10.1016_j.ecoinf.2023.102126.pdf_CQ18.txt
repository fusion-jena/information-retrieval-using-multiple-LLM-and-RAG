Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The text focuses on the use of the F-UJI tool and the FAIR principles to assess the quality of datasets in the context of agriculture. It describes the process of obtaining datasets, evaluating them using the F-UJI tool, and visualizing the results using a computational notebook report. However, it does not mention any details about monitoring the model performance during training.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query based on the given context. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that monitoring the model performance during training is an essential aspect of machine learning and deep learning models. Various strategies can be employed to monitor the model performance during training, such as using validation sets, early stopping, learning rate schedules, and model checkpoints. These techniques help to ensure that the model is not overfitting or underfitting the data and that it is generalizing well to unseen data.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention any details about monitoring the model performance during training, it is an essential aspect of machine learning and deep learning models. Various strategies can be employed to monitor the model performance during training, such as using validation sets, early stopping, learning rate schedules, and model checkpoints.
