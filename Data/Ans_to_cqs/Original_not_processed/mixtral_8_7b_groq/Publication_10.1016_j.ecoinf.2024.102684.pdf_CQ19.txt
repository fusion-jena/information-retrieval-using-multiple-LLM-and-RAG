Answer:::
The deep learning models were built using the Keras library in Python 3.8.3. Keras is a high-level neural networks API, capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated which backend was used for the Keras implementation. However, it is common practice to use TensorFlow as the backend for Keras, given its popularity and extensive community support. Therefore, while not explicitly confirmed, it is highly likely that the deep learning models were built using TensorFlow as the underlying framework.
