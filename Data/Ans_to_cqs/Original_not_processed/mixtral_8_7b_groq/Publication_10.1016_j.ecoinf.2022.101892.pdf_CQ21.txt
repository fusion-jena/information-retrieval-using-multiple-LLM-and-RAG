Answer:::
In the given context, there is no explicit mention of post-training processes such as saliency map generation or confusion matrix calculation. However, it does mention the calculation of a specific metric, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and comparing inference-time for determining the most computationally efficient model.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a model in age estimation tasks. It is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between the estimated age and the actual age for each sample.

In addition, the authors compared the inference-time of different models to determine the most computationally efficient one. They set the batch to 400 to achieve 100% GPU utilization and measured the maximum queries per second (QPS) achieved under real-world conditions. They expanded the dataset by a factor of five, fed batches of 50 images into the model to warm up the hardware, and recorded the inference-time of batches of 100 to quantify QPS.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the post-training steps involved are the calculation of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and determining the most computationally efficient model by comparing the inference-time.
