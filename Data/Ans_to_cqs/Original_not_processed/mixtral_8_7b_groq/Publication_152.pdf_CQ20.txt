The context does not provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that a high-performance computing system was used for training, as deep learning models like U-Net typically require significant computational power. Such systems often include GPUs or TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) to accelerate the training process. Therefore, it is likely that GPUs or TPUs were used for training the U-Net model in this study. However, without explicit information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
