Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling within the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the classification of ecological data using manual methods, online spectral libraries, and machine learning tools. However, it does discuss the potential of incorporating human abilities in pattern recognition with machine learning methods for classification.

Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for image analysis to increase the size of the training dataset and improve model performance. These techniques create new training samples by applying transformations to the existing images, such as horizontal or vertical flipping, rotating by a certain degree, and scaling (zooming in or out).

While the provided context does not discuss these specific data augmentation techniques, it is possible that they were used in the machine learning components of the study. However, without further information, it is not possible to confirm the use of these techniques in the deep learning pipeline.
