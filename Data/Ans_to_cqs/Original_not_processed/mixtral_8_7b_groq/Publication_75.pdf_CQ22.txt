Answer:::
The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using four metrics: average retrieval precision (ARP), average retrieval rate (ARR), Fscore, and mean average precision (mAP). 

The average retrieval precision (ARP) is calculated as the number of relevant images retrieved divided by the total number of images retrieved. It is averaged over five different simulations for all the networks.

The average retrieval rate (ARR) is evaluated by averaging on five different simulations for all the networks. It is calculated as the number of relevant images retrieved divided by the total number of relevant images in the database.

The Fscore is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, where precision is the number of true positive retrievals divided by the total number of positive retrievals, and recall is the number of true positive retrievals divided by the total number of relevant images.

The mean average precision (mAP) is calculated as the area under the precision-recall curve, which is a plot of precision (y-axis) against recall (x-axis). It provides an overall measure of the model's ability to retrieve relevant images.

In addition to these metrics, the performance of the deep learning model is also evaluated using accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. Specificity is the ratio of the number of true negatives to the total number of negatives, while sensitivity is the ratio of the number of true positives to the total number of positives. These metrics are used to evaluate the model's ability to classify images correctly.
