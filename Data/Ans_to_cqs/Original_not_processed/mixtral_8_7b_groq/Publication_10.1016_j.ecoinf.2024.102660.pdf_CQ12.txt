Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically a refined version of the UNet architecture. This model, named Res_AUNet, is designed to enhance the detection of water sun glint in UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) water images. The Res_AUNet model incorporates the Convolutional Block Attention Module into the encoding-decoding skip connections of the UNet network, thereby improving the network's ability to capture distinctive semantic features associated with water sun glint. Additionally, residual structures and reduced convolutional kernel numbers are used to mitigate overfitting. The Res_AUNet model was trained and evaluated using the WSGD dataset, achieving high accuracy, F1-score, and Intersection over Union (IOU) metrics. These results demonstrate the precision of the Res_AUNet model in water sun glint detection, offering valuable insights for effectively eliminating water sun glint and determining the optimal timing for UAV water image acquisition.

An important aspect of training the Res_AUNet model is the use of data augmentation techniques, such as random rotations and flips, to enhance the network's robustness. The model was constructed using the PyTorch library and trained on a Dell workstation with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6248R CPU, 512GB of memory, and an NVIDIA RTX A6000 graphics card with 48GB of memory. The training process involved 120 epochs with a batch size of 8, and the initial learning rate was set to 0.001, which was adjusted using the equal-interval adjustment strategy (StepLR) by halving the original rate every 10 epochs of iteration.
