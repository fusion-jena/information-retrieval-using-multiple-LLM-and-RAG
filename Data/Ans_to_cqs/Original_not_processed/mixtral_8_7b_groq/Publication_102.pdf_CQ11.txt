Answer:::

The provided context does not give a specific link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention two datasets that are used in deep learning research related to object detection in images.

The first dataset is the "aerial elephant dataset" which is mentioned in references [23, 25, 26]. This dataset is available on Zenodo, and the DOI for the dataset is 10.5281/zenodo.3234780. The dataset is a new public benchmark for aerial object detection and was used in a study that proposed a learning model based on a U-Net architecture.

The second dataset is not explicitly named, but it is referred to in reference [18] as "huge air-view images". The study in reference [18] used this dataset to detect animals using a CNN-based sliding window approach. It is possible that this dataset is available in a data repository, but the context does not provide a link to it.

Therefore, while there is no specific link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline, there are two datasets related to deep learning object detection research that are available in data repositories.
