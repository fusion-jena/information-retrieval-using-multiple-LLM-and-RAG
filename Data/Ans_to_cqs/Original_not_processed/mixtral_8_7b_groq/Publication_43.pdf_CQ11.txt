Answer:::
I am unable to provide a direct data repository link for the deep learning pipeline as it was not provided in the given context. However, the context does provide information about the training dataset used for the CNN classifier in a study related to Ziziphus lotus shrubs.

The training dataset for the CNN classifier consists of 100 image patches of Ziziphus lotus shrubs and 100 image patches of bare soil with sparse vegetation. Each image patch is of size 80 x 80 pixels. These images were identified from a set of 82 Ziziphus individuals georeferenced by botanic experts in the training-zone. Out of these 200 images, 80 images of each class were used for training, and 20 images of each class were used for validation.

Therefore, if one were to replicate the study, they would need to collect their own dataset of 80 x 80-pixel image patches of Ziziphus lotus shrubs and bare soil with sparse vegetation. The context does not provide information on how the original dataset was collected or where it can be found.

Additionally, the context provides information on the deep learning model used in the study, such as the loss function and the optimization algorithm. Specifically, the model was trained to minimize the average loss function J(w) using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm.

In summary, while I cannot provide a direct data repository link for the deep learning pipeline, I can provide information on the composition of the training dataset used in the study and the deep learning model architecture.
