Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. There is no mention of methods such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization techniques. The text does mention that the model was implemented in the R programming language using the Keras interface with a Tensorflow backend and an Nvidia RTX2080 graphics card, but it does not provide details about the optimization of the hyperparameters.

The model was trained for 300 epochs using a batch size of 24 images. The optimizer used was RMSprop with an initial learning rate of 0.0001. The loss function used was a sum of two terms: binary cross-entropy and Dice coefficient-related loss of the three predicted masks. However, the context does not mention any hyperparameter optimization methods.

It's possible that the authors used a method such as manual tuning or used a validation set to select the best set of hyperparameters. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
