Answer:::
In the given context, the deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, the two CNNs considered are ResNet and GoogLeNet. These models are commonly used for image classification tasks and are trained based on prediction loss minimization. The loss function used measures the difference between the output of the final layer and the ground truth. The Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimization algorithm is used to update the weights of the models.

ResNet, which won the first place in the 2015 ILSVRC, is currently the most accurate and deepest CNN available with 152 layers and 25.5 million parameters. Its main characteristic is that it creates multiple paths through the network within each residual module. GoogLeNet, the winner of the 2014 ILSVRC, is based on inception v3 and has 22 layers with learnable weights organized in four parts. It has 23.2 million parameters.

For the experiments with GoogLeNet and ResNet-based models, the open-source software library Tensorflow was used. The image patches were resized from 80 × 80-pixels to 299 × 299 by GoogLeNet and to 224 × 224 by ResNet.

To improve the accuracy and reduce overfitting, fine-tuning and data augmentation techniques were used. Fine-tuning was done by initializing the evaluated models with the pre-trained weights of ImageNet. Data augmentation techniques were applied to increase the size of the dataset from 100 to 6000 images.

Therefore, based on the given context, the deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), specifically ResNet and GoogLeNet.
