Answer:::

The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-measure.

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. It gives an overall idea of how well the model is performing. However, it may not be a reliable metric when the classes are imbalanced.

Precision, also known as Positive Predictive Value, is the ratio of true positives (correctly predicted positive instances) to the sum of true positives and false positives (incorrectly predicted positive instances). It measures the model's ability to not label negative instances as positive.

Recall, also known as Sensitivity or True Positive Rate, is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives (incorrectly predicted negative instances). It measures the model's ability to find all positive instances.

F1-measure is the Harmonic Mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that encapsulates both. It is a more balanced measure when dealing with imbalanced classes.

In the provided context, the performance of the deep learning models (ResNet and GoogLeNet) is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-measure, as shown in Table 3. The table displays the results for Test-zone-1 at different sliding window sizes. The metrics are calculated based on true positives (TP), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN).

The training of deep CNNs, such as ResNet and GoogLeNet, is based on prediction loss minimization. The loss function measures the difference between the output of the final layer and the ground truth. During training, the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is used to update the weights, aiming to minimize the average loss.

In summary, the performance of deep learning models is evaluated using various metrics, with precision, recall, and F1-measure being commonly used. These metrics are calculated based on true positives, false positives, and false negatives, and provide insights into the model's ability to correctly predict positive instances, not label negative instances as positive, and find all positive instances.
