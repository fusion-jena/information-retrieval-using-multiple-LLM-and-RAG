Answer:::

The text does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines. However, it does discuss the use of randomness in various machine learning algorithms and techniques.

In the context of the 'neuralnet' package (Fritsch, Guenther, & Guenther, 2019), randomness can be introduced during the initialization of weights and biases in neural networks. This randomness helps to break symmetry and allows the network to learn different features during training.

In the context of ensemble methods, such as Random Forests (Breiman, 2001) and Gradient Boosting (Friedman, 2002), randomness is employed to select a subset of features for splitting at each node (mtry in Random Forests) or to determine the sequence of models for boosting (shrinkage in Gradient Boosting). These techniques help to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of the model.

In the context of hyperparameter tuning (Table 1), random search or grid search can be used to explore the space of hyperparameters. These methods involve randomly or systematically selecting combinations of hyperparameters and training a model for each combination. This process introduces randomness into the model selection and can help to identify a robust set of hyperparameters.

In the context of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for biomass estimation (Ghasemi, Sahebi, & Mohammadzadeh, 2011), randomness can be introduced during the preprocessing of SAR data, such as speckle filtering, to reduce the noise and improve the accuracy of biomass estimation.

In the context of the 70/30 or 80/20 relation between training and testing sets (Gholamy, Kreinovich, & Kosheleva, 2018), randomness is used to split the data into training and testing sets. This split helps to evaluate the performance of the model on unseen data and estimate its generalization error.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, it does mention the use of randomness in various machine learning algorithms and techniques. These strategies include random initialization of weights and biases, random selection of features for splitting, random search or grid search for hyperparameter tuning, random speckle filtering for SAR data, and random splitting of data into training and testing sets. These techniques help to improve the generalization of the model, reduce overfitting, and estimate the performance of the model on unseen data.
