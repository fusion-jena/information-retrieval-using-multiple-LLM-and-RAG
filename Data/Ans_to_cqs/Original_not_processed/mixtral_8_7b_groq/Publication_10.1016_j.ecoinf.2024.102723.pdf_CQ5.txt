Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. The text focuses on the description of a deep learning model for regression problems in agriculture, specifically for predicting crop yields. It explains the implementation of two types of neural network architectures, MCD and VBI, using TensorFlow and Keras. However, it does not provide information on the datasets used in this pipeline.

Commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, CIFAR for image classification, and ImageNet for large-scale image recognition. However, without explicit reference to these or any other datasets in the provided context, it is not possible to accurately answer this query.
