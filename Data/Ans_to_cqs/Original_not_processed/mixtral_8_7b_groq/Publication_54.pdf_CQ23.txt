To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model for recognizing endemic bird species, several measures were taken. Firstly, the training dataset was augmented 10 times, resulting in a total of 31,320 images, to allow the deep networks to converge and improve the model's ability to generalize adeptly. This data augmentation technique helps increase the diversity of the training set by creating modified versions of the original images, thereby reducing overfitting and improving the model's ability to handle new, unseen data.

Secondly, the training dataset was split into two subsets: a training set (80%) and a validation set (20%). This splitting strategy, known as stratified sampling, helps maintain the original dataset's class distribution in both the training and validation sets. By preserving the class distribution, the model is exposed to a diverse range of bird species during the training phase, which in turn improves its ability to generalize and classify new, unseen bird species accurately.

Thirdly, a multistage model validation approach was adopted, where the misclassified datasets from the training and validation sets were swapped, and the model was retrained until it yielded the highest accuracy possible on both the validation and test datasets. This mechanism further enhances the model's generalizability by allowing it to learn from its mistakes and adapt accordingly.

Lastly, five-fold cross-validation was employed to verify the predictive performance of the model. Cross-validation is a powerful technique for assessing a model's generalizability, as it involves dividing the dataset into k subsets or folds, where k-1 folds are used for training, and the remaining fold is used for testing. This process is repeated k times, with each fold serving as the test set once. The average performance across all k iterations provides a more reliable estimate of the model's generalizability than using a single test set.

In summary, the deep learning model's generalizability was ensured through data augmentation, stratified splitting, model retraining with misclassified datasets, and five-fold cross-validation. These measures helped the model learn diverse domain-invariant features from different datasets, facilitating the classification of endemic bird images of new datasets with high accuracy.
