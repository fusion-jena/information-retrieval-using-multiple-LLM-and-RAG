The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some sources and types of data used in the studies.

In the study by Dujardin and Lehning (2022), it appears that they used near-surface wind fields as the raw data, which were downscaled to high-resolution topography using deep learning. The source of these wind fields is not specified in the context.

Elith and Leathwick (2009) used species distribution models, which typically rely on observational data collected through surveys or monitoring programs. However, the specific data sources are not mentioned in the context.

Fick and Hijmans (2017) developed WorldClim 2, a dataset of high-resolution spatial climate surfaces for global land areas. These data were created by interpolating climate observations from weather stations, which were obtained from various public datasets.

Frey et al. (2016) used spatial models to reveal the microclimatic buffering capacity of old-growth forests. They collected microclimate data using sensors deployed in the forest.

Fridley (2009) downscaled climate over complex terrain using high-resolution spatial data. The data sources for these data are not specified in the context.

Potter et al. (2013) discussed microclimatic challenges in global change biology. They mentioned using various types of data, including weather station data, remote sensing data, and eddy covariance data. However, they did not specify how these data were collected.

Hopkinson et al. (2012) optimized input data for gridding climate normals for Canada. They used climate data from weather stations, which were obtained from various sources, including Environment Canada and the National Climatic Data Center.

Overall, while the context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data, it suggests that a variety of data sources and collection methods were used, including surveys, sensors, and public datasets.
