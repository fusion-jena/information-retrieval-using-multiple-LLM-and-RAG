Answer:::

The methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline can include surveys, sensors, and public datasets. However, the provided context focuses more on the analysis of data rather than its collection.

Surveys can be used to collect data in the form of responses from participants. For instance, in the context of ecological modeling, Everaert et al. (2013) discuss the development and assessment of ecological models in the context of the European water framework directive, which would require data collection through surveys or other means.

Sensors are commonly used for data collection in various applications. For example, in water resources applications, Bowden et al. (2002) discuss the optimal division of data for neural network models, which implies the use of sensors for data collection. Similarly, in civil engineering problems, Uncuoglu et al. (2022) compare various methods, including neural networks, which would require data collected through sensors.

Public datasets are another source of raw data for deep learning pipelines. In the context of wind forecasting, Feng et al. (2017) propose a data-driven multi-model methodology with deep feature selection, which suggests the use of public datasets for training and testing their models. Additionally, in the context of streamflow forecasting, Dehghani et al. (2023) compare LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM models using deep learning approaches, which would require a dataset for training and testing the models. While the context does not explicitly mention public datasets, they are a common source of data for deep learning applications.

In summary, surveys, sensors, and public datasets can be used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, the provided context focuses more on the analysis of data rather than its collection.
