Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. The text mentions the use of Wiener, 2002) model with default hyperparameters such as number of trees (ntree = 500), minimum number of observations in a terminal node (nodesize = 5), and number of variables tried at each split (mtry = ⌊Nβ⌋ = 1, where Nβ = 5 is the number of predictors). However, it does not specify any method for hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search or random search.

The context mainly focuses on the use of covariance-weighted bagging to improve the true model performance for machine learning models trained with clustered data. The authors suggest that this improvement may be due to reduced bias during model training from down-weighting over-sampled information. However, they do not explicitly test this hypothesis.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a clear answer to the query regarding the optimization of the model's hyperparameters.
