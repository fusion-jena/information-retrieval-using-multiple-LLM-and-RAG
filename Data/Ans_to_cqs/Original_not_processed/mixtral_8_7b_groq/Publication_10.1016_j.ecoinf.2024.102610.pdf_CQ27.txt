Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, it does mention that the analyses were performed using the Caret and VSURF packages in the R programming language. This suggests that the model was likely trained and validated within an R environment.

The context also describes a feature elimination process that resulted in four retained databases, which were used for model training. This implies that the model was trained on a subset of the original data, selected based on feature importance.

In addition, the authors mention the creation of a "mask to delineate the 'area of applicability'" for the trained model. This suggests that the model's predictions may be limited to certain regions or conditions, and that some form of spatial validation or filtering may be applied during deployment.

However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer about the specific steps taken to deploy the trained deep learning model.
