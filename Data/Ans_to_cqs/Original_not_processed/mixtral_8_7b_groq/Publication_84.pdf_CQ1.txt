Answer:::
The article does not provide specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the authors used Landsat satellite images as the primary data source for their study. Landsat is a series of Earth-observing satellites that have been collecting multispectral imagery of the Earth's surface since the 1970s. These images are publicly available and can be accessed through platforms like Google Earth Engine, which was also used in this study.

The authors used spectral data from Landsat images to capture the three stages of paddy rice growth: sowing, green (emergence and full growth), and bare soil (harvest). Spectral data refers to the measurement of electromagnetic energy reflected or emitted from the Earth's surface in various wavelength bands. By capturing the spectral signatures of paddy rice at different growth stages, the authors aimed to enhance the spectral separability between paddy rice and other land cover types.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the authors used Landsat satellite images as the primary data source for their deep learning pipeline. These images were likely processed to extract spectral data, which was then used as input data for the deep learning model. However, the article does not provide information on whether any additional data sources, such as surveys or other public datasets, were used in the study.
