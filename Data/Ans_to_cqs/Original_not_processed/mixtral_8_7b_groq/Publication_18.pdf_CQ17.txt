The provided context includes information about various topics in deep learning, but it does not directly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting, such as dropout and L2 regularization. However, it does discuss techniques that can help improve the learning and generalization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which can be related to regularization methods.

Data-augmentation is one of the techniques mentioned in the context, which can help increase the robustness and generalization capacity of CNNs (37, 38, 39). Data-augmentation consists of applying specific transformations to the training images, such as scaling, rotations, translations, and different illumination conditions. These transformations simulate the deformations that data could suffer in real-world scenarios, and they can help the model learn to be more invariant to these variations.

Another technique mentioned in the context is transfer learning, which consists of using the knowledge acquired in one problem (problem A) to another problem (problem B) (38). Transfer learning is implemented by initializing the weights of the model for problem B using the pre-trained weights on problem A. This technique can help improve the learning of CNNs, especially when the number of annotated images for problem B is small.

Regularization methods, such as dropout and L2 regularization, are techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Dropout is a regularization technique that consists of randomly dropping out neurons during training, which helps prevent over-reliance on any single neuron and promotes the learning of more robust features (49). L2 regularization, on the other hand, adds a penalty term to the loss function that encourages the model to have smaller weights, which can help prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model (50).

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly mention dropout and L2 regularization, it does discuss techniques that can help improve the learning and generalization of CNNs, such as data-augmentation and transfer learning. These techniques can be related to regularization methods, as they can help prevent overfitting and improve the performance of deep learning models.
