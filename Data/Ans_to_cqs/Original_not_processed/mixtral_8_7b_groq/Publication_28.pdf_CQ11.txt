Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in satellite image classification. The context discusses various models, techniques, and datasets used in the studies, but it does not provide a specific link to a data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.

The first source discusses the structure of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and its use in satellite image classification. It explains the reparameterization trick and the unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning steps used for learning the network parameters.

The second source describes a study that uses red and near-infrared band data for the publicly available SAT-4 & SAT-6 datasets classification. The study presents novel deep learning frameworks for three distinct networks using hyper-tuning and two-band data.

The third source is a figure from a study that analyzes the computation time of the PTDLEN-VAE model on the AID dataset.

Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in satellite image classification.
