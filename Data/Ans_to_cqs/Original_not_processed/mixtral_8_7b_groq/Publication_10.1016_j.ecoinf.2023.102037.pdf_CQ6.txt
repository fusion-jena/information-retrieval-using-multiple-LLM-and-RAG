Answer:::

The provided context discusses the training of a deep learning model for insect detection, but it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps applied to the images before training. However, it can be inferred that the images were split into smaller tiles and maintained their original pixel dimensions.

Image tiling is a common preprocessing step in deep learning, especially when dealing with high-resolution images. The context mentions that the images were sliced into tiles of a fixed size (512x512 pixels) using the "impy" library in Python. This allowed for the efficient use of memory during training while preserving the important information required for detecting small insects.

Additionally, the context implies that the images were not subjected to any cleaning or normalization techniques. This is evident from the fact that the white balance of the images was set to "Incandescent," which suggests that the original color balance of the images was preserved.

However, it is important to note that other preprocessing steps, such as normalization and scaling, are commonly used in deep learning. Normalization is the process of scaling the pixel values of an image to a range between 0 and 1, which can improve the training of deep learning models. Scaling is the process of resizing the images to a fixed size, which can reduce the computational cost of training.

In summary, based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model for insect detection include image tiling to maintain the original pixel dimensions and efficiently use memory. However, other common preprocessing steps such as normalization and scaling were not explicitly mentioned in the context.
