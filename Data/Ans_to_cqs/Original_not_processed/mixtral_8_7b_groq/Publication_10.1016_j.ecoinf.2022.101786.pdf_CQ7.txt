Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in the study referenced involve creating separate datasets for training, validation, and testing. The training dataset, which consists of 58,148 images, was used to train the CNN model. During this process, the algorithm cycles through the training set, evaluating performance on the validation set, and adjusting CNN node weights before repeating the cycle. This is done to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model can predict both the training set and independent data it has not seen.

The validation set, which is also part of the training dataset, is used to evaluate the performance of the model during the training process. The optimum number of iterations is determined by monitoring the performance on both the validation and training sets. Once the performance on the validation set starts to diverge from the training set, it indicates that the CNN is overfitting and becoming more specialized at predicting the training set while becoming less able to predict the validation set.

The testing dataset, composed of 500 manually annotated images from the same transect, is used to calculate the performance of the different CNNs and the effect of different confidence thresholds outside the Darknet framework. Predictions made on the testing set are compared to the manual annotations of the same images to measure the accuracy of the model.

In summary, the data is split for deep learning model training in this study by creating separate datasets for training, validation, and testing. The training dataset is used to train the model, the validation set is used to evaluate the performance during the training process, and the testing set is used to measure the accuracy of the model. The split is done to prevent overfitting, ensure the model can predict independent data, and measure its performance.
