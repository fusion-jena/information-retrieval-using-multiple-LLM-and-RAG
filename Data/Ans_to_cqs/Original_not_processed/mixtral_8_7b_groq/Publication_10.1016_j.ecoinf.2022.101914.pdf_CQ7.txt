Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. However, it does mention that the researchers used six modeling approaches, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) as one of the machine learning models.

The context explains that the data was divided into five folds for cross-validation purposes during model training. One fold was set aside for obtaining presences and background points to use during external evaluation, while the remaining four folds were used for internal cross-validation during model training. This process was followed for each of the six modeling approaches.

For the ensemble models, the researchers used the best models from each of the six modeling approaches to create an ensemble. This suggests that the data splitting for the deep learning model (ANN) would have followed the same criteria as the other modeling approaches, which is cross-validation using five folds.

However, the context does not mention any specifics about the criteria used to split the data for the train, test, and validation sets in the context of deep learning model training. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query based on the given context.
