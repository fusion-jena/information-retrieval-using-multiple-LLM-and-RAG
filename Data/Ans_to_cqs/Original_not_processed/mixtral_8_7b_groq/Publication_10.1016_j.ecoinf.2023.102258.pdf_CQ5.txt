Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for bioacoustic sound event detection. However, it does mention two datasets, QU and MGE, which contained very short sounds at around the scale of the typical granularity of spectrograms (10 ms per frame). The framewise CNN of Du_NERCSLIP excelled on these datasets.

In general, the deep learning pipeline for bioacoustic sound event detection involves the use of spectrograms or other feature extraction methods to convert audio data into a format that can be processed by deep learning models. These models are typically trained on large datasets of annotated audio data, such as the Xeno-Canto and Macaulay Library digital bioacoustic archives. However, the context suggests that many bioacoustic sound event detection scenarios involve small datasets, which can make it difficult to apply deep learning methods effectively.

Therefore, while the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for bioacoustic sound event detection are not specified in the provided context, it is clear that the pipeline involves the use of spectrograms or other feature extraction methods, deep learning models trained on annotated audio data, and potentially the application of transductive few-shot learning methods to mitigate the challenges of small datasets.
