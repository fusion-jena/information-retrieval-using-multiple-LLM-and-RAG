Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the machine learning (ML) model. However, there are some indications of the performance evaluation metrics that were used in the study.

The study reports the accuracy of the ML bounding box model as 92.2% on the given data. Additionally, the study provides a confusion matrix (Fig. 3) that shows the percentage of true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative classification outcomes. From this, we can derive other performance metrics such as precision and recall. The study reports a precision of 92.6% and recall of 91.5%.

In the context of training a machine learning model, one common criterion used to determine when training is complete is when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly. This indicates that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data and is not overfitting. However, this information is not provided in the context.

Therefore, based on the given context, we cannot definitively answer the query regarding the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the ML model. However, we can infer that the study evaluated the performance of the ML model using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, and recall.
