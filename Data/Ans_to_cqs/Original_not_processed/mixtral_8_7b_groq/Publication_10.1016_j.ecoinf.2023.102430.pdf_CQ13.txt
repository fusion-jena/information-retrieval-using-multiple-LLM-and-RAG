Answer:::

The deep learning model used in the study mentioned was a pre-trained convolutional neural network called AlexNet (AN). The training of this model was carried out in MATLAB, and the stochastic gradient descent with momentum optimizer was used with default settings. However, the initial learning rate was set to 0.001, and the maximum number of epochs was set to 15.

Additionally, the study mentions that they used scikit-learn in Python for running 'classical' machine-learning algorithms. Although the specific deep learning model used is AlexNet, the study does not mention any other hyperparameters used in this model.

Therefore, the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are the initial learning rate of 0.001, the stochastic gradient descent with momentum optimizer, and the maximum number of epochs of 15.
