The provided context discusses the evaluation methods used for the models, but it does not explicitly mention the use of accuracy, precision, or recall as metrics for evaluating the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention two metrics that are used: the area under the curve (AUC) and the maximum attainable true skill statistic (TSS).

The area under the curve (AUC) is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model. It measures the entire two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve (receiver operating characteristic curve), which is a plot of the true positive rate against the false positive rate. An AUC of 1 represents a perfect classifier, while an AUC of 0.5 represents a classifier that is no better than random guessing.

The maximum attainable true skill statistic (TSS) is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model, particularly in the context of remote sensing and ecology. It is defined as the maximum vertical distance between the ROC curve and the line representing random guessing. A TSS of 1 represents a perfect classifier, while a TSS of 0 represents a classifier that is no better than random guessing.

Additionally, the context states that the models are evaluated quantitatively with numerical scores and calibration plots, and qualitatively through predictions mapped on geographic locations in QGIS. The models are evaluated using 500 posterior draws, with the point estimates being the medians of the predictions and reported with their interquartile ranges (IQRs), or the width of the 50% credible intervals.

It is important to note that because a supervised feature selection procedure was utilized, final model assessments not calculated via a nested approach may overestimate model performance. However, nested CV experiments for E. maximus indicate that this bias is very slight.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the area under the curve (AUC) and the maximum attainable true skill statistic (TSS) are the two metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model.
