Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix after the model training. The context mainly focuses on the process of transfer learning and the results of different experiments.

However, it does mention the calculation of Top-1 and Top-5 accuracies as part of the testing stage of the experiments. This could be considered a form of metrics calculation, but it is not a postprocessing step that occurs after the model training.

In conclusion, based on the given context, there are no specific postprocessing steps mentioned after the model training.
