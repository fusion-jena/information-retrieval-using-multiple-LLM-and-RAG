Answer:::
The deep learning model for classifying 2D LiDAR images into "Plateau", "White-sand", and "Riparian" classes was built using the fast.ai framework. The fast.ai platform, which is based on PyTorch, was used to train and validate the models for this classification problem. This choice was made because the ResNet-34 architecture, a variant of the ResNet family that is widely used for deep learning tasks, was utilized inside the fast.ai framework. Additionally, the dataset used in this study is relatively small, and the fast.ai framework is particularly useful for such cases as it can leverage existing knowledge.
