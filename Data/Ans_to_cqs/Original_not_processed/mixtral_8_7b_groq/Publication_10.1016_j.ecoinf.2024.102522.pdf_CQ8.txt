Answer:::

 I am unable to locate the specific information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline in the provided pieces of context. The context consists of various research papers and articles about the ecological distribution and spread of certain pests, such as Hyphantria cunea and Agrilus planipennis, but there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It is possible that the research did not involve a deep learning pipeline or that the code repository is not publicly available or was not included in the papers. I would recommend reaching out to the authors of the relevant papers for more information.
