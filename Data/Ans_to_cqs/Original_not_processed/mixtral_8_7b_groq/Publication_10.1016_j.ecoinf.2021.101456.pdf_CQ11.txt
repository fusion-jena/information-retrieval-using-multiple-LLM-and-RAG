Answer:::

I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the use of a dynamic β-VAE for obtaining low-dimensional latent representations of insect spectral data, with the aim of creating clusters for species classification. It discusses the architecture of the VAE, the optimization objective, and the benefits of using a dynamic β-VAE compared to other methods. However, there is no mention of where the dataset or the deep learning pipeline can be found or accessed.
