Answer:::

The provided context does not contain specific information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, deep learning models can handle various data formats such as images, audio, video, and structured data like CSV files. The type of data format used depends on the problem at hand and the type of deep learning model being implemented. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used for image and video data, while recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are used for sequential data like audio and time-series data. Ultimately, the choice of data format depends on the specific application and the data available.
