Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not include information about the specific deep learning model used in the study. Therefore, I cannot provide the hyperparameters of the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer, as they are not specified.

However, the context does mention that the relative importance of each predictor variable on both the response variables (i.e., richness and abundance) was calculated based on the change in prediction error using a model. This suggests that some sort of predictive model was employed, but the specific type of model (e.g., deep learning, random forest, etc.) is not mentioned.

In summary, while the context provides information on the study area, data sources, and methods for calculating the relative importance of predictor variables, it does not include details about the deep learning model's hyperparameters.
