Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. Generalizability, also known as model's ability to perform well on unseen data, can be assessed using various techniques such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, and stratified splitting. However, the context focuses more on the tagging efficiency experiment, data collection, and model performance evaluation rather than the steps taken to enhance the deep learning model's generalizability.

Answer:::

However, we can infer some practices that might have been employed to enhance the deep learning model's generalizability. First, the dataset used in the study consisted of 6936 tagging events from three treatments, which could indicate a certain level of diversity in the data. Second, the R package glmmTMB was used to fit the model, which is a generalized linear mixed model that can handle complex data structures and potentially improve model performance. Lastly, the R package DHARMa was used to evaluate the fit of the GLMM, which includes simulation-based dispersion and outlier tests that could help identify potential issues in the model.

Answer:::

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, there are some inferences that can be made based on the data collection, model fitting, and evaluation techniques used in the study. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the study primarily focuses on the tagging efficiency experiment and model performance evaluation rather than the generalizability of the deep learning model.
