Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the availability of supplementary materials and archives. These materials include Metadata of FAOâ€™s GDA photointerpreted very high resolution plots and Metadata of training dataset of continuous larger sample CNN-based model. These are available as Archive S1 and Archive S2 in the supplementary materials. However, these do not seem to be a comprehensive data repository for the entire deep learning pipeline.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of various datasets for training the CNN models, but it does not provide links to these datasets. These include the NWPU-RESISC45 dataset, Google scholar academic search engine results, and Google Maps.

In conclusion, while there are supplementary materials and archives associated with this study, there is no explicit link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The datasets used in the study are also not directly accessible from the provided context.
