Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the processing of satellite imagery data, including resampling and harmonizing the band data to a 10-meter resolution for image classification. It also mentions the importance of training samples and their parameters for a reliable accuracy assessment. However, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query using the given context.
