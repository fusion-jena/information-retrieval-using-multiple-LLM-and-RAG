Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the Random Forest (RF) model was used to examine the relative importance of the selected environmental and anthropogenic variables on the invasive plant species richness and abundance separately. The RF modeling approach is a bagging technique that has an enhanced predictive accuracy and allows quantification of variable importance for each potential predictor. The RF model uses bootstrap aggregation and randomization of predictors, and works by using the training dataset containing both the response and predictor variables, associated distance matrix, and distance thresholds. The model's performance could be monitored by using techniques such as cross-validation, where the data is split into training and testing sets, and the model's performance is evaluated on the testing set. However, the specific strategy used in this case is not mentioned in the provided context.
