Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of any optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the use of the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) neural network approach for identifying ecological sources and setting scenarios. The SOFM algorithm is used to classify ecosystem functions objectively and automatically form weights among the elements, avoiding subjectivity in weight setting. However, it does not specify any optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

The context provides information on the use of the Davis-Boldin Index (DBI) for establishing the ideal number of bundles and hotspot analysis using Getis-Ord G*i for spatial clustering of Ecological Service Value (ESV). The analysis aims to uncover the dominant service functions and ecological values of the land-use types where the ecological sources are located.

Moreover, the context includes tables comparing the Cost Ratio and Coefficient of Variation (CV) values of three methods, namely ES bundles, ES importance assessment, and Morphological spatial pattern analysis. However, these tables do not provide any information on optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
