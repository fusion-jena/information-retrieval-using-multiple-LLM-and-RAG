Answer:::
The deep learning models were implemented in PyTorch and trained using Nvidia RTX2080Ti GPUs. This information is provided in section 4.5 of the context, which discusses the implementation details of the models. The training of each neural network on a single GPU took approximately 14 days, indicating the significant computational resources required for training these models. However, the context does not mention the use of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) for training. Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that Nvidia RTX2080Ti GPUs were used for training the deep learning models.
