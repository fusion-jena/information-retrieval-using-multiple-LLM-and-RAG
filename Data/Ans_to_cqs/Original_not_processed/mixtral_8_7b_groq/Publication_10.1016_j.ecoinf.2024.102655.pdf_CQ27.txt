Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, including steps such as model serialization or platform selection.

However, the context does mention that machine learning models, which can include deep learning models, were applied and used for prediction. The results from these models were then discussed in Section 4 of the study. Additionally, the context highlights the importance of analyzing historical trends in water quality data to find the most variable and representative scenarios for machine learning model training.

Therefore, while the specifics of the model deployment process are not provided, it can be inferred that the trained machine learning models were analyzed and evaluated in Section 4 of the study. The models' performance and predictive outputs were likely assessed to determine their effectiveness and suitability for the intended application.

It is also possible that the models were serialized, or saved in a format that allows for easy loading and deployment, although this is not explicitly stated in the context. Similarly, the platform or environment in which the models were deployed is not mentioned.

In summary, while the specifics of the model deployment process are not provided in the given context, it can be inferred that the trained machine learning models were evaluated and assessed for performance. However, further information would be needed to provide a more detailed answer regarding model serialization and platform selection.
