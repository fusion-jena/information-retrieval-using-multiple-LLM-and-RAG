Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. The text discusses a deep learning pipeline for classifying bird species using their songs, but it does not specify which dataset was used. Commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, CIFAR for image classification, and ImageNet for large-scale image recognition. However, in this case, the input to the models are log-mel spectrograms of bird songs, which suggests that a specific bird song dataset was used, but it is not named in the text. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query without additional information.
