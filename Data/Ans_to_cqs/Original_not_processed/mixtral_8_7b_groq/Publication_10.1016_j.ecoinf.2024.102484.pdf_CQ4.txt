The provided context does not include information on the specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for monitoring ecosystem service change or assessing land degradation. However, it does mention the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and soil property datasets.

In general, data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for image analysis tasks. These techniques can help increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, improving the model's ability to generalize and reducing overfitting.

Flipping involves horizontally or vertically flipping the images in the dataset, which can help the model learn symmetries in the data. Rotating involves rotating the images by a certain angle, which can help the model learn invariance to rotation. Scaling involves changing the size of the images, which can help the model learn invariance to scale.

Other data augmentation techniques that can be used in deep learning pipelines for image analysis tasks include brightness and contrast adjustment, adding noise, and cropping.

It's important to note that the choice of data augmentation techniques depends on the specific task and dataset at hand. Therefore, it's essential to experiment with different techniques and evaluate their impact on the model's performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for monitoring ecosystem service change or assessing land degradation, techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in image analysis tasks. The choice of data augmentation techniques depends on the specific task and dataset, and it's essential to experiment with different techniques and evaluate their impact on the model's performance.
