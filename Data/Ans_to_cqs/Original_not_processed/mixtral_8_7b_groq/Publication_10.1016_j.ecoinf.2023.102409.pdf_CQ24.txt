Answer:::

The strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include the use of a fixed random seed value, data augmentation, and dropout.

A fixed random seed value ensures that the same initial weights are used for each iteration of the training process, which can help to ensure reproducibility of results. This is important for scientific research, as it allows other researchers to replicate the results and build upon them.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data. This can include rotations, translations, and flips, among other transformations. By applying these random transformations, the model is exposed to a wider variety of data, which can help to improve its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Dropout is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction of the input units to zero, which can help to prevent the model from becoming too reliant on any one input feature. This can help to improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

In the context of the article provided, the authors use deep learning models to generate high-precision fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) in drylands using high-resolution remote sensing images. While the article does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that the authors used a fixed random seed value and data augmentation to ensure reproducibility and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.
