Answer:::
The provided context does not offer explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model after training. However, it does offer some insights into the training process that might imply certain deployment steps.

The training was conducted using Tensorflow 1.14 and executed on a GTX2080Ti GPU. This suggests that the model could be deployed on systems with similar or higher specifications. The use of Tensorflow also indicates that the model could be deployed in a variety of ways, such as being exported as a Tensorflow SavedModel or a frozen graph, which can then be used in different applications or integrated with other systems.

However, the context does not mention any specifics about the platform selection for deployment, model serialization, or how the model was integrated with the image processing module. Therefore, while we can infer some possible steps based on the training details, the exact process followed for deploying the trained deep learning model remains unknown based on the provided context.
