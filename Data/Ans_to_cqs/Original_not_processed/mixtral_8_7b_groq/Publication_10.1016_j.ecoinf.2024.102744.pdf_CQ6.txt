The provided context discusses the construction of a deep learning model for classifying pollen-bearing and non-pollen-bearing honeybees, but it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps applied to the images before training the model. However, based on common practices in deep learning, we can infer some possible preprocessing steps.

Answer:
In deep learning, several preprocessing steps are typically applied to input data before training a model. These steps may include normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Although the provided context does not explicitly mention these steps, we can still discuss them.

1. Normalization: Normalization is the process of rescaling pixel values to a range between 0 and 1. This is done by dividing each pixel value by 255 (since RGB values range from 0 to 255). Normalization helps the model converge faster during training and reduces the likelihood of getting stuck in local minima.

2. Scaling: Scaling refers to adjusting the input image size to match the model's input requirements. In the given context, the input size is 224x224 pixels. Scaling is necessary because deep learning models require a fixed-size input.

3. Cleaning: Cleaning involves removing noise or unwanted artifacts from the images. This may include cropping unnecessary parts of the image, removing blur, or adjusting contrast and brightness. While the context does not mention any specific cleaning steps, it is still an essential preprocessing step.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps, it is likely that the authors applied normalization, scaling, and cleaning to the input images before training the deep learning model.
