Answer: The provided context discusses the use of deep learning techniques for estimating aquatic ecosystem health indices, but it does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a random forest (RF) regression model and XGBoost model, both of which involve some level of randomness.

In the case of the RF regression model, the number of estimators was set to 100, and the random state was set to 0. The random state parameter is used to specify the seed of the pseudo-random number generator, which is used when shuffling the samples. By setting the random state to a fixed value, the same set of random numbers is generated each time the model is run, which can help to ensure reproducibility of the results.

Similarly, the XGBoost model has several hyperparameters that involve randomness, such as the subsample ratio of the columns when constructing each tree and the maximum depth of a tree. However, the context does not mention whether a fixed seed value was used for the XGBoost model.

In addition, the context mentions the use of an autoencoder, which is a deep learning algorithm that involves encoding and decoding mechanisms. Autoencoders typically involve some level of randomness in the initialization of the weights and biases. However, the context does not mention any specific strategies used to handle randomness in the autoencoder.

Overall, while the context does not provide extensive details on strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of a fixed random state value in the RF regression model and the potential for randomness in the initialization of weights and biases in the autoencoder.
