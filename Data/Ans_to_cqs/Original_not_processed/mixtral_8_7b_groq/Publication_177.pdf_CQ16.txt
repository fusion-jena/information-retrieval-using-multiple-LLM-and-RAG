Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific information about the criterion used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the models were trained for a maximum of 10 epochs using the stochastic gradient descent with momentum (sgdm) optimizer. This suggests that the training may have been set to stop after a fixed number of epochs, regardless of the performance of the model on the validation dataset.

In general, when training a machine learning model, it is common to monitor the performance of the model on a validation dataset during training. Training is typically considered complete when the performance on the validation dataset stops improving or begins to degrade, even if training has not yet reached the maximum number of epochs. This is often referred to as early stopping.

Early stopping helps to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model performs well on the training dataset but poorly on new, unseen data. By monitoring the performance on the validation dataset, which is not used during training, it is possible to get an estimate of how well the model is likely to perform on new data. If the performance on the validation dataset stops improving or begins to degrade, it is likely that the model is beginning to overfit to the training dataset, and training can be stopped to prevent this.

In the context provided, it is possible that early stopping was used, but this is not explicitly stated. It is also possible that training was simply set to stop after a fixed number of epochs. Without more information, it is not possible to say for certain.
