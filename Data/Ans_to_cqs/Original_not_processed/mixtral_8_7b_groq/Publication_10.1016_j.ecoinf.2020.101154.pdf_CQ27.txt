Based on the provided context, there is no information about the deployment of a deep learning model. The text focuses on the hyperparameter tuning of Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) models for the analysis of herring assessment data. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer regarding the deep learning model deployment process, such as model serialization or platform selection.

However, I can summarize the hyperparameter tuning process for the GBRT models described in the context:

1. The learning rate and maximum tree depth were initially set to low values for both CS and NW datasets.
2. A grid search was performed on both datasets with a two-part split to find hyperparameters with the highest accuracy. The learning rate was set to 0.05, and the maximum tree depth was set to 4 for both CS and NW models.
3. Early stopping was used to determine when to stop model training and avoid overfitting.
4. The number of iterations required until convergence was 120 for CS and 106 for NW.
5. For RY models, the best performing models were those with a slow learning rate of 0.005 and shallow trees.
6. The number of iterations was kept at 500 for RY models.
7. The subsample rate was 0.75% for all models.
8. Parameters for 2-part splits were defined through grid search, whereas parameters for 3-part splits were tuned manually.
