Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, we can infer that various metrics and techniques are used to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of the model.

Firstly, confusion matrices are used to provide detailed information regarding both correct and incorrect classifications made by the model. This valuable insight enables the identification of potential deficiencies in classifying specific classes or categories.

Secondly, various performance metrics are used to assess the model's accuracy, including balanced accuracy (B. Acc), F-measure Fβ, Cohen’s kappa coefficient k, and Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC). These metrics provide a more complete and accurate picture of the model's performance, which is essential for proper evaluation.

Thirdly, the context mentions the use of graphical visualizations to portray the performance estimation achievement. This suggests that visual monitoring of the model's performance during training is also part of the strategy.

Lastly, the model's performance is evaluated based on the final results obtained in a real fire. This implies that the strategy includes monitoring the model's performance in real-world scenarios to ensure its applicability and effectiveness.

Therefore, while the specific strategy for monitoring the model performance during training is not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that various metrics, visualizations, and real-world evaluations are used to ensure the model's accuracy and effectiveness.
