Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically ResNet-50. This model is used to extract features from frequency-reassigned spectrogram images of data segments. The activations from the fully connected layer fc1000 of ResNet-50 are then utilized as a feature vector for each detected signal. These features are subsequently used in a one vs. all Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to differentiate 'boatwhistles' from 'other' signals within the feature space. Therefore, the overall model can be classified as a CNN-SVM transfer learning pipeline.
