Answer:::

To monitor the model performance during training, a strategy of randomly separating 80/20% of the classified points was implemented. This separation generated a training/validation dataset, which was used later in the accuracy assessments. This approach allowed for the continuous evaluation of the model's performance as it was being trained, ensuring that the model was not overfitting to the training data and was able to generalize well to new, unseen data.

In addition to this, a separate geometry called 'add trees' was created to address the issue of an unbalanced training set. This occurred when a completely random sampling protocol produced a training set with a low number of woody cover examples, resulting in the misclassification of smaller woody plants. By adding well-defined examples of woody cover elements to the 'add trees' geometry, the number of training points for the woody cover class was increased to match that of the other class. This new geometry was then merged with the randomly allocated woody points, creating a more balanced and representative training set.

The training and validation points were collected from sampling plots that were strategically placed within the vegetation types described by Gertenbach (1983). Instead of generating 400 random points over the entire boundary, the sampling plots were created within each vegetation type to ensure that the training/validation points were representative of the diverse vegetation within each boundary. The size of the sampling plots was calculated by first determining 5% of the total area covered by the boundary, and then dividing that area by the number of vegetation types intersecting the boundary.

The use of these strategies allowed for the continuous monitoring of the model's performance during training, ensuring that the model was able to accurately classify the different vegetation types within the boundary. This is important for the accurate monitoring and management of the land cover within the Maiella National Park, as well as for the creation of land cover maps that can be used for global change studies.
