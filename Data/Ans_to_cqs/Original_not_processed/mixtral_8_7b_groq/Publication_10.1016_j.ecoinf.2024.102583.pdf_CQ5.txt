Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM). However, it does mention the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) for LSM. Commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, CIFAR for image classification, and ImageNet for large-scale object recognition. It is possible that the researchers used similar image datasets for LSM, but this is not explicitly stated in the context.

The context does provide information on the factors and their corresponding categories used in the LSM study. These factors include soil, distance to stream, land cover, lithology, and distance to road. The categories for each factor are as follows:

* Soil: Inceptisols, Ultisols, Entisols, Alfisols, and other soil types
* Distance to stream: 0-50m, 50-100m, 100-150m, 150-250m, 250-360m
* Land cover: Forest, Grassland, Wetland, Cropland, Barrenland, Urban, Water body
* Lithology: Mica-schist, Henderson-Gneiss, Garnet-mica-schist, Biotite-gneiss and schist, Migmatitic-granitic-gneiss, Amphibolite and biotite-gneiss, Granite-gneiss, Porphyroblastic-gneiss, Caesars-Head Granitic-Gniess
* Distance to road: <200m, 200-400m, 400-600m, 600-800m, >800m

These factors and categories were used to create landslide susceptibility maps using various machine learning models, including CNN and RCNN. The performance of these models was then compared with other machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in the context of landslide susceptibility mapping.
