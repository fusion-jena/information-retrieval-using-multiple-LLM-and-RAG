Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix following the model training. The context focuses on the use of Bayesian networks and cluster analysis for exploring coral reef communities in Puerto Rico.

However, it does mention a process of "realigning the conditional probabilities in the network from the data" and "convergence (no change) or a stopping point is reached," which could be considered part of the model evaluation process.

Additionally, the context describes the creation of a "hierarchical clustering network that summarizes information on the coral reef community from the measured variables across taxa." This suggests a postprocessing step of visualizing and interpreting the results of the model through a hierarchical clustering network.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention common postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix, it does describe a process of model evaluation and the creation of a hierarchical clustering network for interpreting the results of the model.
