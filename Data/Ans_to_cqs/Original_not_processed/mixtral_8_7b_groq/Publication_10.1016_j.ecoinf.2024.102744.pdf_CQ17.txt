Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline provided in the context uses the Dropout layer as a regularization method to prevent overfitting. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during the training process, which helps to make the network more robust and less prone to overfitting on the training data. However, L2 regularization is not explicitly mentioned in the given context.

The Dropout layer is integrated into the classification network after the Global Average Pooling layer, which summarizes features and generates input for the fully connected layer. The subsequent three fully connected layers generate the predicted class for the original image. The Probability value associated with the Dropout layer is 0.5, meaning that half of the neurons will be dropped out during training.

Moreover, the context discusses other techniques to improve the deep learning pipeline, such as the Focal Loss function and the Overlap Sampler technique. While these methods are not strictly regularization techniques for preventing overfitting, they contribute to the overall performance of the model. The Focal Loss function is used to address data imbalance issues, and the Overlap Sampler technique is used to improve the object detection network's performance by focusing on overlapping regions.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline described in the context uses Dropout as a regularization method to prevent overfitting. Dropout is applied after the Global Average Pooling layer, and the probability of dropping out neurons is set to 0.5. Other techniques, such as Focal Loss and the Overlap Sampler, are used to improve the model's performance but are not directly related to preventing overfitting.
