Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the specific deep learning model used, its hyperparameters, learning rate, or optimizer. The context focuses on the use of Random Forest (RF) as a machine learning algorithm in the GEE (Google Earth Engine) environment for ecological informatics.

The RF model's hyperparameters were preserved in the GEE implementation, except for the number of trees, which was set to 500 for improved computational efficiency and precision in BA (burned area) estimates. The mean decrease in the Gini Index (dGI) was calculated to assess RF variable importance on classification accuracy.

In summary, the context does not provide information about the deep learning model or its hyperparameters.
