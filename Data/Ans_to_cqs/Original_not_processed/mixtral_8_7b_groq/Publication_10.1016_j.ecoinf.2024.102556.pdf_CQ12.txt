Answer:::
The deep learning model used in the pipeline described in the context is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is inferred from the mention of various components and processes that are characteristic of CNNs. 

Firstly, the Res2Net module, which is a novel residual network structure, is used. Residual networks are a type of CNN that mitigate the degradation problem associated with an increase in the number of layers by adding shortcut connections. 

Secondly, the context mentions the use of convolutional kernels of different sizes (1 × 1 and 3 × 3) for feature extraction. This is a fundamental operation in CNNs where kernels are slid over the input to extract features.

Thirdly, the context describes the use of group convolution in the Res2Net framework. Group convolution is a technique used in CNNs to increase the computational efficiency of the network by dividing the input channels into groups and applying convolution separately to each group.

Lastly, the context mentions the use of Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks (ELAN) and Hybrid Convolutional (MPConv). Both of these are layers used in CNNs for feature extraction and aggregation. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
