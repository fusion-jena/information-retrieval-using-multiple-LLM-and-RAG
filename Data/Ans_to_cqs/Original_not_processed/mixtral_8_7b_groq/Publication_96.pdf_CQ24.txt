The provided context does not give specific information about how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome. However, it is common practice in deep learning to use a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results.

A random seed value is used to initialize the random number generator, which is used in various parts of the deep learning pipeline such as weight initialization, data shuffling, and dropout regularization. By setting a fixed random seed value, the same sequence of random numbers is generated every time the model is trained, ensuring that the same set of weights are initialized and the same data samples are used in each training epoch. This helps to ensure that the training process is reproducible and that any differences in model performance can be attributed to changes in model architecture, hyperparameters, or training data, rather than randomness.

In the context of mapping burned areas, using a fixed random seed value could help ensure that the same spectral training samples are used in each training epoch, and that the same sequence of random weight initializations is used. This could help to ensure that any differences in model performance are due to changes in model architecture, hyperparameters, or training data, rather than randomness.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a fixed random seed value, it does mention the use of a semi-automated methodological approach for mapping burned areas. This approach likely involves some degree of human intervention and decision-making, which could introduce a source of non-randomness into the mapping process. However, the high overall accuracy of the mapping approach (97%) suggests that any sources of non-randomness were effectively controlled.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline for mapping burned areas, it is common practice in deep learning to use a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This practice could have been employed in the mapping approach described in the context, but this is not explicitly stated.
