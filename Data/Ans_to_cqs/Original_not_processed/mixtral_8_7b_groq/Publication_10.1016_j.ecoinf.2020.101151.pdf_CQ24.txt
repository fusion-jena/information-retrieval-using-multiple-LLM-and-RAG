I'm sorry for any confusion, but the query you provided is about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, while the context you've given is about vegetation, fire weather indices, and forest fire vulnerability. 

The two topics are not related, so I can't provide an answer to the query using the given context. If you have any questions related to the context provided, I'd be happy to try to answer those.
