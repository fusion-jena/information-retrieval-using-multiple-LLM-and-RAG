Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through grid search, random search, or any other method. The text focuses on the comparison of different allometric equations for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) in a Pinus sylvestris forest using UAV-derived datasets.

However, it can be inferred that the models were calibrated and validated using ground-measured tree morphological parameters and UAV-derived parameters. Several equations were compared, and equation W4 showed the best performance (R2 = 0.731, RMSE = 2.46 kg) in estimating AGB for the Pinus sylvestris forest. It is possible that the optimization of hyperparameters was conducted as part of the development of these allometric equations, but the specific methods were not mentioned in the provided context.
