Answer:::
The deep learning model for detecting polar bears was trained using a GeForce RTX 2070 Super graphics processing unit (GPU) with 8 GB of memory. No other hardware resources such as TPUs were mentioned in the provided context.

The use of a GPU for deep learning tasks is common due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which is essential for the computationally intensive nature of these tasks. The specific GPU used in this case, the GeForce RTX 2070 Super, is a high-performance GPU that is well-suited for deep learning tasks.

The 8 GB of memory available to the GPU is a crucial factor in determining the mini-batch size used during training. The mini-batch size is the number of training examples used in one iteration of the training process. A smaller mini-batch size may not provide sufficient image data for the network to learn from, while a larger mini-batch size may cause the network to overfit to the training images.

The size of the images used in this case is 224 × 224 pixels × 3 bands, and the ResNet-50 network used as the foundation of the CNN has 25.6 million internal parameters. These factors, along with the available GPU memory, determine the maximum mini-batch size that can be used during training.

In summary, a GeForce RTX 2070 Super GPU with 8 GB of memory was used for training the deep learning model for detecting polar bears. The GPU's ability to perform parallel processing and the available memory were critical factors in determining the mini-batch size used during training.
