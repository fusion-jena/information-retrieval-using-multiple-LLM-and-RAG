The provided context does not directly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. However, it does discuss a study using Fisher Identity Test (FIT) for species and sex discrimination of martens, which involves some data preprocessing.

In the FIT process, outliers were identified and removed from the dataset before subsequent analyses (Ecological Informatics 79(2024)). This suggests that data cleaning is an essential preprocessing step.

For the discriminant analysis of species and sex, the authors used tracks of martens and divided the data into training, validation, and test groups (Alibhai et al., 2023). Although not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the data was prepared by organizing it into appropriate categories and splitting it into these groups for analysis.

The study by Alibhai et al. (2023) also mentions that their approach simplifies the FIT process by requiring fewer landmark points and being adaptable to tracks of varying quality. This implies that some form of data normalization or scaling might have been applied to make the data more consistent and suitable for analysis.

In summary, based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model may include:

1. Data cleaning: Removal of outliers or anomalies to improve data quality.
2. Data organization: Preparing the data by categorizing and splitting it into appropriate groups (e.g., training, validation, and test sets).
3. Data normalization or scaling: Adjusting the data to make it more consistent, which might include techniques like standardization or normalization of features.

However, it is important to note that the context does not explicitly mention deep learning models or specific preprocessing techniques.
