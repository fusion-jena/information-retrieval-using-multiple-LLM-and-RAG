Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the deep learning pipeline or the methods used for collecting raw data in that pipeline. However, it does mention the use of remote sensing data for training machine learning models in the field of ecological informatics.

Remote sensing is the acquisition of information about the Earth's surface using sensors that are not in direct contact with the surface. These sensors can be carried by aircraft or satellites, and they can measure various characteristics of the Earth's surface, such as reflectance in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. In the context provided, remote sensing data from NAIP, RapidEye, and Landsat imagery are used for training machine learning models.

To collect this remote sensing data, sensors are used to capture electromagnetic radiation reflected or emitted from the Earth's surface. The specific sensors used for NAIP, RapidEye, and Landsat imagery are not mentioned in the context, but they are likely to be multispectral or hyperspectral imaging sensors that can measure reflectance in multiple bands of the electromagnetic spectrum.

In addition to remote sensing data, the context also mentions the use of "training locations" and "metadata records" for training machine learning models. These training locations and metadata records are likely to have been collected through field surveys or other ground-based data collection methods. However, the specific methods used for collecting these data are not described in the context.

Therefore, while the context provides some information about the use of remote sensing data in machine learning pipelines, it does not give a complete picture of the methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines.
