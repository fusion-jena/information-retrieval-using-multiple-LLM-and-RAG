Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline described in the context uses the Adam optimizer. In the network setup for investigations, a ResNet50 model is used in conjunction with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) during all three phases. The ResNet50 model is initialized with ImageNet weights from Keras before phase 1 and phase 2. The Adam optimizer is used in conjunction with the ResNet50-FPN setup during each phase.

In the first and second phases, the pipeline trains a classification network and a segmentation network, respectively, using GBIF image data. The classification network applies class activation mapping to generate weak segmentation maps, which are then used for training the segmentation network in the second phase. In the third phase, the network's weights can be used to train a plant cover prediction network on actual vegetation data or applied directly to vegetation data to generate zero-shot predictions without any training on plant cover annotations.

It is important to note that the optimization technique used in the comparison baseline is not explicitly stated in the context. A ResNet50 model pre-trained on the ImageNet classification dataset with added FPN is used for comparison. However, the optimizer used during the training of this baseline model is not specified.

Answer:::

In summary, the deep learning pipeline described in the context uses the Adam optimizer for training the ResNet50-FPN model during the first two phases. The pipeline applies class activation mapping to generate weak segmentation maps, which are then used for training the segmentation network. In the third phase, the network's weights can be used for training a plant cover prediction network or applied directly to vegetation data for zero-shot predictions. The optimization technique used in the comparison baseline is not explicitly stated.
