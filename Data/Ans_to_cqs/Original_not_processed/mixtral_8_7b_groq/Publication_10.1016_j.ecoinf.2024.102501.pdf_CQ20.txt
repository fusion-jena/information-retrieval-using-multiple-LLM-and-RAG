The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. However, it is mentioned that deep learning methods such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and other machine learning models like Support Vector Regression (SVR) have been used to predict dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration. It is common to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to train deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which significantly speeds up the training process compared to using a Central Processing Unit (CPU) alone. Therefore, it is likely that GPUs or TPUs were used for training the deep learning models in the studies mentioned in the context, but this information is not explicitly stated.
