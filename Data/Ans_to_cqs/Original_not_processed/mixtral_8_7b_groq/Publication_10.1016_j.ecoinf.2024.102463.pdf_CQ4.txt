Based on the provided context, there is no information about data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the described deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the use of the HyperBand algorithm for optimizing hyperparameters in model architectures, specifically for a deep learning model with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent layers.

The hyperparameters mentioned include the CNN window size and the number of filters, as well as the structure of the encoder. The HyperBand algorithm explores different configurations of these hyperparameters in parallel, allocating more training resources to promising configurations while eliminating those with inferior performance.

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide information on the data augmentation techniques used in this pipeline.
