Answer:::

The pieces of context provided do not directly answer the query about data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines. However, they do contain information about the use of deep learning for image analysis in various applications such as identifying vegetation and corn plants using UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) flights.

In the context of these applications, image segmentation is a common data annotation technique used in deep learning pipelines. Image segmentation involves dividing an image into multiple segments or regions, each representing a different object or class. This technique is used in the contexts [20], [21], [24], and [29] for identifying and classifying different types of vegetation, maize drought, and corn plants.

Instance segmentation, a more advanced form of image segmentation, is also used in deep learning pipelines. Instance segmentation involves not only dividing an image into multiple segments but also identifying and labeling each instance of an object within the image. This technique is used in the context of [22] for counting corn plants.

Another data annotation technique used in deep learning pipelines is bounding box annotation. This technique involves drawing a bounding box around an object within an image and labeling it. While this technique is not explicitly mentioned in the provided contexts, it is commonly used in object detection tasks.

Data augmentation is another technique used in deep learning pipelines to improve results quickly. This technique involves creating new training data by applying various transformations such as rotation, scaling, and brightness changes to the existing data. This technique is used in the context of [29] for improving the F1 score of the CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model.

In summary, image segmentation, instance segmentation, bounding box annotation, and data augmentation are common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for image analysis tasks.
