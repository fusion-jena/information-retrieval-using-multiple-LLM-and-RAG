The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline of the DIVERSIMAR project or the INDITIC Consortium. The focus of the texts is on the data acquisition, processing, and analysis of biodiversity-related tweets rather than the machine learning algorithms used.

However, it is mentioned that the twarc2 library was used to handle the data in JSON format returned by the Twitter API. Twarc2 simplifies handling quota limits and pagination, but it does not explicitly mention any optimization techniques for deep learning models.

In general, optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), and others are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to minimize the loss function and improve model performance. The choice of optimization technique depends on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not specify the optimization techniques used in the DIVERSIMAR project or the INDITIC Consortium, it is common practice in deep learning pipelines to use optimization techniques like SGD, Adam, and others to minimize the loss function and improve model performance.
