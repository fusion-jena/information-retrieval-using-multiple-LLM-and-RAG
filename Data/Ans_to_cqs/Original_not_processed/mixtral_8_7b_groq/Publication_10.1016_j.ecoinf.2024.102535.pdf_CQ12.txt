Answer:::

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is inferred from the descriptions of the chosen CNN architectures, namely VGG, ResNet, and Xception, which are all variants of CNNs. These CNNs are used for image classification tasks and are composed of a feature extractor stage that reduces the spatial resolution of the input through convolution and pooling operations, followed by fully connected layers that predict the input image class based on the extracted features. The context also mentions specific components of CNNs, such as convolution (Conv and SConv), maxpooling, dropout, and dense layers, further confirming the use of CNNs in the pipeline.
