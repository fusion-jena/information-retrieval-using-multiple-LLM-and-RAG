Answer:::

The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention several studies that use deep learning techniques for image recognition and classification in various fields.

In deep learning, randomness can be introduced in various stages of the pipeline, such as the initialization of weights, data shuffling, and dropout regularization. These techniques help to prevent overfitting, improve generalization, and provide a robust model.

For instance, in the study by Szegedy et al. (2017), they introduced Inception-v4 and Inception-ResNet models, which use residual connections to improve learning. These models may have used random initialization of weights and dropout regularization during training. Similarly, in the study by Liu et al. (2023a), they proposed a deep residual convolutional neural network based on YOLOv5 for species recognition. This model may also have employed randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Furthermore, in the study by Tiwari et al. (2021), they used dense convolutional neural networks for multiclass plant disease detection and classification using leaf images. They may have used a random seed value for weight initialization and data shuffling to ensure the robustness of the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is common practice to introduce randomness in various stages of the deep learning pipeline, such as weight initialization, data shuffling, and dropout regularization. These techniques help to prevent overfitting, improve generalization, and provide a robust model.
