Based on the provided context, there is no specific information on how the hyperparameters of a model are optimized. The context discusses various topics related to ecological informatics, remote sensing, and the use of spectral vegetation indices for monitoring vegetation and pest damage level. However, it does not mention any methods for hyperparameter optimization such as grid search or random search.

Hyperparameter optimization is an important aspect of machine learning model building, as it can significantly impact the model's performance. Grid search and random search are two common methods for hyperparameter optimization. Grid search involves systematically searching through a predefined set of hyperparameter values, while random search involves randomly sampling hyperparameter values within a defined range.

Therefore, without additional information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query regarding the optimization of hyperparameters in the context provided.
