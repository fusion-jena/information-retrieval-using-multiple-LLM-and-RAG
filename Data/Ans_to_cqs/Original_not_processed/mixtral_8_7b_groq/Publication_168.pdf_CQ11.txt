Answer:::

I am unable to provide the exact data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the mentioned studies as it was not provided in the given context. However, the studies mentioned in [4], [7], [8], and [9] have used hyperspectral image (HSI) data for forest species classification. HSI data is a type of remote sensing data that captures detailed information about the earth's surface in hundreds of narrow, contiguous spectral bands.

The study in [4] used the Indian Pines dataset, which is publicly available and can be downloaded from the University of Indiana's website. The studies in [7], [8], and [9] used the Pavia University dataset, which is also publicly available and can be downloaded from the website of the University of Pavia.

These datasets can be used to reproduce the deep learning pipelines used in the studies. Additionally, the papers provide detailed descriptions of the data preprocessing, network architecture, and training procedures used in the studies.

Therefore, if you are interested in reproducing the deep learning pipelines used in these studies, you can download the HSI datasets from the aforementioned links and follow the procedures described in the papers.
