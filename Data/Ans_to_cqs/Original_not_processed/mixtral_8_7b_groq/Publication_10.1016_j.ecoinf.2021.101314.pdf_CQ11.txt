The provided context does not include a direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention a website where more information about the study can be found.

The study referenced in the context is "Ecological Informatics 63(2021)1013147" by Galbrun et al. The authors provide a link to the website of The Nature Conservancy (TNC) where the GIS data used in the study can be found: <http://maps.tnc.org/gis_data.html>.

It is possible that the deep learning pipeline data is available through this website, but the context does not provide specific information on this. If the data repository link is crucial for your research, I would recommend contacting the authors directly or checking the TNC website for more information.
