Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning model being used in the described study. The model developed for the study is a random forest (RF) binary classification model, which is a type of machine learning model and not a deep learning model.

Deep learning models are a subset of machine learning models that are inspired by the structure and function of the brain, and are capable of learning and making decisions based on large amounts of data. Common deep learning models include convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and segmentation, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequence prediction and natural language processing.

In contrast, the RF model used in the study is a type of ensemble learning model that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions. The RF model is trained on a subset of the training data randomly sampled with replacement, and makes predictions by averaging the class assignment probabilities produced by all trees in the forest.

Therefore, the purpose of the deep learning model in this study is not clear, as there is no mention of a deep learning model being used. The model used in the study is a RF binary classification model, which is used to identify iceplant within Santa Barbara County coast vegetation.
