Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline mentioned in the context is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This is specified in the context in section 4.3.3, where it mentions that the LSTM model is a common deep learning model used to solve the prediction problem of time series data. The LSTM model is used to replace the Markov chain prediction model to better capture the nonlinearity and long-term dependency relationships in time series data, improving the prediction accuracy of land conversion.
