Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF for the deep learning pipeline. However, the document does reference several models and papers that are part of the deep learning pipeline.

The document cites the ImageNet database, which is a large-scale hierarchical image database that is widely used in visual recognition research. The ImageNet database can be accessed at the following link: <http://www.image-net.org/>.

The document also references several models that are used in the deep learning pipeline, including Wide-ResNet-101, ResNet-101, InceptionV3, and MnasNet-A1. These models are described in various papers, including:

* Wide Residual Networks: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07146>
* Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567>
* MnasNet: Platform-aware Neural Architecture Search for Mobile: <https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.11626>

These papers provide more information about the models and their implementation, but they do not provide a direct link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline.

Finally, the document references several other papers that discuss various aspects of deep learning, including data augmentation and the impact of biased mislabeling on learning with deep networks. These papers may provide additional context for the deep learning pipeline, but they do not provide a link to a data repository.

In summary, while the provided context does not include a direct link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline, it does provide references to several models and papers that are part of the pipeline. Additionally, it references the ImageNet database, which is a widely used resource in visual recognition research.
