Based on the provided context, the specific details of the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model were not mentioned. The text focuses on the methodology and results of a study that employed an ensemble modeling approach using the BIOMOD2 package in R to predict the distribution of certain study species. The models used include one regression-based model and three machine-learning models (MaxEnt, RF, and SVM). The models' performance was tested using cross-validation and the Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) as the accuracy index. However, there is no information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
