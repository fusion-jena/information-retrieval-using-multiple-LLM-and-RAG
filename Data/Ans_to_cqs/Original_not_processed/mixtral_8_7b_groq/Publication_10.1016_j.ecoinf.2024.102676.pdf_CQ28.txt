Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text mentions the use of OpenAI's ChatGPT for spell checking, grammar checking, and debugging in code, but this tool was used for improving the readability of the work and not for deploying the deep learning model. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine the specific cloud platform (such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform) used for deploying the deep learning model.
