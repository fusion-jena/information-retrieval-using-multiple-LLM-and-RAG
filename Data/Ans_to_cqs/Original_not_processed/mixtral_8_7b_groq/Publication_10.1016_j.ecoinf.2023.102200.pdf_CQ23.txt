Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some implications that suggest that cross-validation or a diverse dataset may have been used.

In the study by Liu and Abd-Elrahman (2018), they used LiDAR data with a density of 78 points/m2 for individual tree segmentation. The generation of this LiDAR data met the requirements for the study, but it is not clear if data from multiple sources or with different densities were used to train the deep learning model. If so, this would have contributed to the model's generalizability.

In the study by Marasigan et al. (2019), they measured mangrove crown diameter from airborne LiDAR data using a marker-controlled watershed algorithm. While they did not use deep learning, they explored the performance of their algorithm using different input parameters. This kind of sensitivity analysis can help ensure that the model performs well across a range of conditions, which is an important aspect of generalizability.

In the study by Martins et al. (2021), they used machine learning and SLIC for tree canopies segmentation in urban areas. They used a dataset of high-resolution aerial images from four different cities, which suggests that they took steps to ensure the generalizability of their model by using a diverse dataset. However, they did not explicitly mention using cross-validation or stratified splitting.

In the study by Jin et al. (2018), they used deep learning for individual maize segmentation from terrestrial LiDAR data. They used a faster R-CNN and regional growth algorithms, but they did not mention using cross-validation or a diverse dataset. However, they did use data from multiple plots and different growth stages, which may have contributed to the model's generalizability.

In the study by Kaartinen et al. (2012), they conducted an international comparison of individual tree detection and extraction using airborne laser scanning. They used data from multiple sites and countries, which suggests that they took steps to ensure the generalizability of their model. However, they did not explicitly mention using cross-validation or stratified splitting.

In the study by Kuenzer et al. (2011), they reviewed remote sensing of mangrove ecosystems. They mentioned the importance of using a diverse dataset, including different mangrove species, sites, and sensors, to ensure the generalizability of remote sensing models. However, they did not provide specific examples of studies that had done this.

Therefore, while there is some indirect evidence that cross-validation or a diverse dataset may have been used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models in these studies, there is no explicit information provided in the context.
