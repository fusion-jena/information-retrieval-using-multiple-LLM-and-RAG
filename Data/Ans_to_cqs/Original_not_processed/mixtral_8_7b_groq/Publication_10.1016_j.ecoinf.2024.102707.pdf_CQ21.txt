Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the calculation of F1 scores, which is a type of metric used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model.

F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect precision and recall. Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions (TP) to the total predicted positives (TP + FP), where FP stands for false positives. Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions (TP) to the total actual positives (TP + FN), where FN stands for false negatives.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the postprocessing steps after model training include the calculation of true positive, false positive, and false negative predictions, as well as the calculation of precision, recall, and F1 scores.

However, there is no mention of other postprocessing techniques such as saliency maps or confusion matrices. Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the important features in the input data that the model uses to make its predictions. Confusion matrices are tables that summarize the predictions made by a model, showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

In summary, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps after model training include the calculation of F1 scores, precision, recall, true positive, false positive, and false negative predictions. However, there is no explicit mention of other postprocessing techniques such as saliency maps or confusion matrices.
