Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text does not mention any specific techniques used for hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization.

However, it does provide information about the architecture of the EF network, which consists of three convolutional layers, two max-pooling layers, and two fully connected layers. The filter size and output size of each layer are specified, but there is no mention of how these parameters were chosen or optimized.

Additionally, the text mentions that the buffer of both references was obtained by applying morphological dilation using a disk of radius 2 and then performing a difference between the dilated and original images. This operation expanded the boundaries of the deforested polygons and resulted in the outer edge, which was not considered for training, validation, or test. However, this is related to data preprocessing rather than hyperparameter optimization.

Therefore, while the context provides valuable information about the model architecture and data preprocessing techniques used in the study, it does not explicitly answer the query regarding hyperparameter optimization.
