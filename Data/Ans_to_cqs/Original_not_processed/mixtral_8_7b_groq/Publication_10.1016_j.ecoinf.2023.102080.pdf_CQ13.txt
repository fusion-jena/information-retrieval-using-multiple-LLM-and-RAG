Answer:::

The provided context does not mention any deep learning models or hyperparameters specific to deep learning models such as learning rate or optimizer. The models mentioned are GLM (Generalized Linear Models), GAM (Generalized Additive Models), and RF (Random Forests). The hyperparameters mentioned are related to these models and the data preprocessing steps.

The data preprocessing steps include collinearity filtering (Step A) and model-specific embedding (Step B). The collinearity filtering function, `covsel.filteralgo()`, has a specific argument `corcut` which is the correlation coefficient threshold used for identifying collinearity. The model-specific embedding function, `covsel.embed()`, has specific arguments such as `ncov` (target number of covariates to include in the final set), `maxncov` (maximum possible number of covariates to include in the final set), `nthreads` (number of cores to be used during parallel operations), and `force` (name(s) of the covariate(s) to be forced in the final set).

The models GLM, GAM, and RF are fitted using selected covariate sets from the main and complementary procedures. The accuracy of these models is evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC), the maximized True Skill Statistic (maxTSS), the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI), and their average "Score" value obtained through a split-sample strategy repeated 100 times with 30% of the data kept aside for validation. However, there are no hyperparameters specific to deep learning models mentioned in the context.
