Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. The context focuses on comparing the performance of two models, DL-YOLO and YOLOv5n, in terms of metrics like missing detection, bounding box deviation, and duplicate detection. It also provides some statistical data, such as weight, estimated efficiency, identified accuracy, root mean square error, and mean relative error. However, there is no mention of the hyperparameter optimization process. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
