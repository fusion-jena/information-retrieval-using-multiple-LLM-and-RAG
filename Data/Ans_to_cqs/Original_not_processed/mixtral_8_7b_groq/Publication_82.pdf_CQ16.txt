Answer:::

The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the experiments is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that each experiment runs for a total of 30 epochs, where one epoch is defined as the number of training iterations in which the neural network has completed a full pass of the whole training set. It is also noted that the learning always converged well within 30 epochs. Therefore, it can be inferred that the training is completed after a fixed number of epochs, in this case, 30 epochs, regardless of any validation loss plateau or other convergence criteria. This approach is often used when there is a limited amount of data or computational resources, or when the model is known to converge quickly. However, it may not always be the most effective way to train a model, especially when dealing with larger and more complex datasets.
