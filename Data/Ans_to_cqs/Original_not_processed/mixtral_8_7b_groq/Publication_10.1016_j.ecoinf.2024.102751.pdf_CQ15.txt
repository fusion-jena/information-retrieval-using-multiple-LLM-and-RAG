The provided context does not contain specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for estimating soil moisture. However, it does mention the potential use of machine learning or deep neural networks for increasing the accuracy of soil moisture prediction.

In general, optimization techniques are crucial in deep learning pipelines to adjust the parameters of the model and minimize the loss function. Some commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the parameters of the model by taking a single random sample from the training dataset and computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters. SGD is computationally efficient, but it may converge slowly and get stuck in local minima.

Adam is a more advanced optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of several optimization techniques. It uses the moving averages of the gradient and the squared gradient to adapt the learning rate for each parameter. Adam is computationally efficient, requires little memory, and is less sensitive to the choice of the learning rate.

The choice of the optimization algorithm depends on the specific problem and the characteristics of the dataset. For example, if the dataset is large and the computational resources are limited, SGD may be a good choice. If the dataset is small and the model has many parameters, more advanced optimization algorithms such as Adam may be more appropriate.
