The provided context does not directly discuss the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does describe a methodology for selecting samples in a study involving ecological informatics and remote sensing. This methodology includes both automatic and semi-automatic techniques for creating and refining sample collections.

In the automatic selection process, random samples are generated within a study area, with the constraint that the selected points must be located within EGI and WCNV shapefiles. These samples are then categorized into two classes: "citrus" and "non-citrus." Notably, the random samples are created separately for EGI and WCNY, resulting in distinct sample sets for each classification.

To enhance the accuracy and robustness of the sample selection, post-supervision and manual collection steps are implemented. In the post-supervision step, a human operator reviews the automatically generated sample feature collection and deletes any inappropriate selections using GE's images. Additionally, a variety of samples are manually collected based on the GEE satellite view, introducing a semi-automatic element to the process.

While this context does not directly address the query regarding deep learning pipeline randomness strategies, it does highlight the importance of addressing potential issues in data collection methodologies. In the case of deep learning pipelines, employing a fixed random seed value can help manage randomness and ensure reproducibility in the training process. Other strategies, such as cross-validation and ensemble methods, can also be used to mitigate the effects of randomness and improve model performance.
