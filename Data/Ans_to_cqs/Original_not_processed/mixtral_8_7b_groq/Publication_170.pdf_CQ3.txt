Answer:::
The provided context does not include specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for image classification. However, it does mention the use of "newly-labeled images" in the training of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model for automatically identifying and counting wild animals in camera-trap images (Norouzzadeh et al., 2018).

In general, data annotation techniques for deep learning in computer vision tasks such as image classification can include:

1. Image-level labeling: This is the simplest form of annotation where each image is assigned a single label corresponding to the dominant object or scene in the image.
2. Bounding box annotation: In this technique, a bounding box is drawn around each object of interest in an image. This provides a rough localization of the object and is useful for object detection tasks.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with the class of the object it belongs to. This provides a more precise localization of objects and is useful for tasks such as instance segmentation and object counting.
4. Keypoint annotation: In this technique, specific keypoints or landmarks are identified and labeled on objects in an image. This is useful for tasks such as human pose estimation and facial landmark detection.

The context does mention that the DCNN model used in the study is the AlexNet model, which includes five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). However, it does not provide specific details about how the training images were annotated. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
