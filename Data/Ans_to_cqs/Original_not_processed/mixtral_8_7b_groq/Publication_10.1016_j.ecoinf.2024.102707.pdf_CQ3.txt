The provided context does not contain specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the studies mentioned. However, it does mention the use of deep learning and remote sensing for various applications such as detecting penguin guano, counting animals from drone imagery, and surveying seabird colonies.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for computer vision tasks include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a rectangle around the object of interest in an image. It is a simple and efficient way to annotate data, especially when dealing with large datasets.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel of an object in an image, providing a more precise localization of the object. It is more time-consuming and labor-intensive than bounding box annotation but can provide better results for certain applications.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling pixels in an image according to the object class they belong to, without distinguishing individual instances. It is useful for applications where the number of instances is not important, but rather the overall distribution of classes in the image.

For the specific studies mentioned, it can be inferred that some form of data annotation was performed, as deep learning models require labeled data for training. However, the exact techniques used are not specified in the provided context.
