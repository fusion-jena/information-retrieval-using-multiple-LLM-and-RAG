Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context consists of various research articles and studies related to ecological informatics, species distribution modeling, and environmental biogeography. However, none of these studies mention or describe a deep learning pipeline or provide a link to a data repository for one. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested information.
