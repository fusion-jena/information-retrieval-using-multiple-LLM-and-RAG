In the context provided, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. This is mentioned in the description of the Faster R-CNN approach, which is a method for object detection in images. The Faster R-CNN uses a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to propose object locations in feature maps generated from the input image. These object locations are represented as bounding boxes, which are rectangular regions that enclose the objects of interest in the image. The RPN serves as the 'attention' mechanism of the unified Faster R-CNN, focusing on these proposed object locations and refining them for prediction.

The use of bounding box annotation in the Faster R-CNN approach is further supported by the references to various applications of deep learning in agricultural pest recognition. For instance, [19] introduces IP102, a large-scale benchmark dataset for insect pest recognition, which uses bounding box annotation to represent the location of insect pests in images. Similarly, [20] describes an automatic localization and count system for agricultural crop pests based on a deep learning pipeline, which also uses bounding box annotation.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline is bounding box annotation. This technique is commonly used in object detection tasks, where the goal is to locate and classify objects within an image.
