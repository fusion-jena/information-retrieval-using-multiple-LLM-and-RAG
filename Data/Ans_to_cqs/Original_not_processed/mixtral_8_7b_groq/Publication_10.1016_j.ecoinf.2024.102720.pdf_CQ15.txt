Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning algorithm for strategic planning mentioned in Report 1998.

However, it is mentioned that a deep learning algorithm was used for strategic planning, and deep learning algorithms typically use optimization techniques to adjust the weights and biases of the neural network during training. Some common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad.

For instance, in a more recent study by Ren, Cao, Du in 2023, they used an ecosystem service value and changes in food supply and demand in Liaoning Province, but no specific optimization techniques were mentioned. Similarly, Rotar and Sangeorzan in 2018 studied the evolution of minimum arable land and food consumption from 1961 to 2013, but there is no information about deep learning or optimization techniques.

In another study by Saadi and Antoni in 2023, they assessed the role of settlement in the environmental challenges of sensitive ecosystems, but no mention of deep learning or optimization techniques was made.

Therefore, while optimization techniques are commonly used in deep learning algorithms, there is no specific information provided in the given context about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning algorithm for strategic planning mentioned in Report 1998.
