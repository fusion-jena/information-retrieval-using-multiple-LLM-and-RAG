The provided context discusses the use of annotated data in the training of machine learning models, specifically for the fine-tuning of pre-trained language models. However, it does not explicitly mention specific data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. These techniques are commonly used in computer vision tasks, while the context focuses on natural language processing.

In the described approach, researchers can either fly the exploitation or sale of a particular taxa, or annotate a randomly selected sample of collected data according to their own relevancy criteria. Annotating a random sample may not be suitable for cases where relevant examples make up a small proportion of the collected data, as imbalanced training data can lead to poor classification performance.

For their study, the authors used a dataset of web articles and social media posts related to bat-related or exploitation-related terms. Documents were split into chunks of 300 tokens using the NLTK word-tokenizer, and chunks containing any of the original query terms were retained. The first such chunk of the document was then retained for use in model training and evaluation.

The authors fine-tuned pre-trained language models, such as BERT and SciBERT, to achieve high classification accuracy with less than 500 training examples. They noted that, beyond a certain peak number of training examples, model performance is likely determined by the nature of the textual data and the model, rather than the volume of training data.

In summary, while the provided context discusses the importance of annotated data in the training of machine learning models, it does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. These techniques are commonly used in computer vision tasks, and the context focuses on natural language processing.
