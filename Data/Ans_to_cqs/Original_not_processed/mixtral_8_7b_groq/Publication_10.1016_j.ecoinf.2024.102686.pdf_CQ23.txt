Answer:

The provided context does not give specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. It mainly discusses the use of machine learning, particularly Support Vector Machines (SVM), for large-scale partitioning and regional differentiation studies. However, it does mention the importance of analyzing and processing a large amount of complex data for such studies.

In the context of machine learning and deep learning, generalizability is often enhanced through various measures, such as:

1. Diverse dataset: Using a dataset that covers a wide range of variations and scenarios can help the model to generalize better to unseen data.

2. Cross-validation: This technique involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on one subset, and testing it on another. This process is repeated for all subsets, providing a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.

3. Stratified splitting: In cases where the dataset is imbalanced or has specific class distributions, stratified splitting can ensure that the training and testing sets maintain the same class distribution as the original dataset.

4. Regularization: Techniques like L1 and L2 regularization can prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging the model to have simpler weights.

5. Early stopping: Monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training and stopping the training process when the performance starts to degrade can help prevent overfitting.

Without specific information from the context, it's impossible to determine which of these measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
