The text provided does not give specific details about the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that AutoGluon, an open-source AutoML library, was used in the study. This library simplifies the process of training high-performance ML models, including neural networks, on structured data with minimal code. It automates various steps such as feature engineering, data pre-processing, model training, and ensembling.

Given this information, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was likely deployed using the serialization feature provided by AutoGluon or a similar library. Model serialization is the process of saving the state of a trained model to disk so that it can be loaded and used for making predictions at a later time, without having to retrain the model. This is a common practice in machine learning and deep learning model deployment.

As for the platform selection, the text does not provide any information on where the model was deployed. It could have been deployed on a local machine, on a cluster, or in the cloud, depending on the requirements of the application.

In summary, while the text does not provide specific details about the process of deploying the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized using a library like AutoGluon, and deployed on a platform suitable for the application.

Answer:::
The text provided does not give specific details about the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was likely deployed using model serialization, and the choice of platform would have depended on the requirements of the application.
