Answer:::

The provided context does not mention any specific deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers being used in the pipeline. The study focuses on the analysis of forest fires using data layers like FWI and FFMC with a spatial resolution of 1 × 1 km, and comparing the number of correct predicted forest fires given by different variants. The analysis is based on 135 forest fires from the year 2018 and 195 forest fires from 2019, using two approaches: analyzing 100 × 100 m grid cells where ignition points of forest fires are located and analyzing a 300 × 300 m data grid that includes the surrounding eight cells. The context mainly discusses the methodology, data, and evaluation of the forest fire prediction, but it does not specify any deep learning models used in the process.
