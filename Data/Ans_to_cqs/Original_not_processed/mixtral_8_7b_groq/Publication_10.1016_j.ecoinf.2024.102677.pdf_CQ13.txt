The context provided does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention that several state-of-the-art CNN architectures, including Visual Geometry Group (VGG), Inception, and residual network (ResNet) CNNs, were fine-tuned using the training dataset. These networks have their own default hyperparameters, which may have been used or adjusted during the fine-tuning process.

In general, hyperparameters refer to the configuration variables that are set before the learning process begins. Some common hyperparameters in deep learning include:

1. Learning rate: This determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function.
2. Optimizer: This is a method used to update the weights and biases in the network based on the gradient of the loss function.
3. Number of epochs: This is the number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.
4. Batch size: This is the number of samples that will be used in one iteration.
5. Regularization techniques (e.g., L1, L2): These are methods used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function.

Without more specific information, it is difficult to provide the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, the context does suggest that the ResNet50 model was found to be the most effective for the rural landscape type classification task.
