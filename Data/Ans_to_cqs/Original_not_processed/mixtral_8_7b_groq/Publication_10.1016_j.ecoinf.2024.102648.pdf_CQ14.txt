Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific information on how the hyperparameters of the models used for predicting bark thickness, hypericin content, insect pests, or disease factors were optimized. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.

Grid search involves creating a grid of hyperparameter values and training the model with each combination to find the best set of hyperparameters. Random search, on the other hand, randomly selects hyperparameter values from predefined ranges and trains the model with these values. Bayesian optimization uses Bayesian inference to iteratively select hyperparameter values that are likely to result in better model performance.

In the study by Mosaffaei and Jahani (2021), they used ANN and regression models to predict bark thickness of ash with 61.6% and 83% accuracy, respectively. However, they did not mention how they optimized the hyperparameters of the ANN model. Similarly, Saffariha et al. (2021) observed that the ANN technique (multi-layer perceptron) had an advantage over radial basis function (RBF) and support vector machine (SVM) in predicting hypericin content in Hypericum perforatum with 87%, 80%, and 54% accuracy, respectively. However, they did not provide details on hyperparameter optimization.

Shang and Zhu (2021) proposed a prediction model that combines the genetic algorithm and machine learning algorithms (ANN) to forecast the occurrence of insect pests. While they mentioned using ANN, they did not specify how they optimized the hyperparameters.

In the study by Singh et al. (2018), they used weather data with an extreme learning machine (ELM) and AICR potato database for potato disease infection and achieved an accuracy of 91.5%. However, they did not mention how they optimized the hyperparameters of the ELM model.

Xiao et al. (2018) developed a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to predict the presence of pests like bollworm, whitefly, and jassid. They used historical weather data and crop growth information as input features. However, they did not provide information on hyperparameter optimization.

In summary, while the context provides information on various models used for predicting different agricultural factors, it does not provide specific details on hyperparameter optimization. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.
