Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about specific postprocessing steps like Saliency maps or Confusion matrix after the model training. However, it does mention the calculation of several statistical metrics to evaluate the performance of the model.

After the training of the W-ANN model, the following postprocessing steps were taken to evaluate its performance:

1. **Metrics Calculation**: The model's performance was assessed using several statistical metrics. These include Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and correlation coefficient (R). These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and predictive capability of the model by measuring the deviation between the predicted EVI values and the actual observed values.

However, the context does not mention any postprocessing steps like Saliency maps or Confusion matrix. Saliency maps are often used in image classification tasks to highlight the important features that the model used for making a particular prediction. A Confusion matrix, on the other hand, is used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It compares the predicted classifications with the actual classifications and can provide insights into the types of errors the model is making.

But given the nature of the task in the provided context, which is predicting EVI values using a W-ANN model, these postprocessing steps might not be applicable or necessary. The focus was more on the accuracy of the predictions as evaluated by the statistical metrics mentioned above.
