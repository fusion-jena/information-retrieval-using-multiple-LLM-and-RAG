Answer:::

The provided pieces of context do not offer a direct answer to the query regarding the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention some sources of data that are used in the studies.

In the context of vegetation studies, remote sensing is a common method for collecting data. Remote sensing involves the use of sensors on satellites or aircraft to measure various characteristics of the Earth's surface, such as vegetation health, biomass, and phenology. For example, Perry et al., (2022) used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data to study spatial and temporal biomass and growth for grain crops. Potter and Alexander (2020) used remote sensing data to investigate changes in vegetation phenology and productivity in Alaska over the past two decades. Tan et al., (2022) used remote sensing indicators to investigate the effects of snow cover and vegetation on soil temperature in the three river source region, China. Zhang et al., (2003) used MODIS data to monitor vegetation phenology. Zhang et al., (2016) used synthetic NDVI time series blended from Landsat and MODIS data for grassland biomass estimation. Zhao et al., (2021) studied spatiotemporal variation in vegetation coverage and its driving factors in the Guanzhong basin, NW China using remote sensing data.

Public datasets are also used in the studies. For example, Beck and Goetz (2011) used satellite observations of high northern latitude vegetation productivity changes between 1982 and 2008 from a public dataset. Beck et al., (2006) used MODIS NDVI data from a public dataset to improve monitoring of vegetation dynamics at very high latitudes.

Therefore, it can be inferred that remote sensing and public datasets are methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for vegetation studies. However, the context does not provide information on other methods such as surveys or other types of sensors.
