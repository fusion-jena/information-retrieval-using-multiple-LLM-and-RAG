Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several papers and articles that discuss the use of deep learning in remote sensing and related fields, but none of them provide information about a specific code repository.

It is possible that the authors of these papers and articles have made their code available in a repository, but they have not provided a reference to it in the context. Therefore, it would be necessary to contact the authors directly to inquire about the availability of the code.

Alternatively, there are many open-source deep learning libraries and frameworks available that can be used for remote sensing applications, such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch. These libraries provide pre-built functions and modules that can be used to develop deep learning models for remote sensing data.

For example, the TensorFlow library provides a module called TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS) that can be used to load and preprocess remote sensing data for deep learning models. Additionally, there are several pre-trained deep learning models available in the TensorFlow library that can be fine-tuned for remote sensing applications.

Therefore, while there is no specific code repository mentioned in the provided context, there are many resources available for developing deep learning pipelines for remote sensing applications.
