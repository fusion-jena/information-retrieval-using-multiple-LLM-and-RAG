Answer:::

The text provided does not give specific details about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It mentions that some model parameters were modified from the default configuration, but it does not specify the method used to find the optimal parameters. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves testing a model with all possible combinations of a predefined set of hyperparameter values. Random search, on the other hand, involves randomly selecting hyperparameter values to test within a given range. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic model to make informed decisions about which hyperparameter values to test next. Without more information, it is not possible to determine which of these methods, if any, were used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model in this study.
