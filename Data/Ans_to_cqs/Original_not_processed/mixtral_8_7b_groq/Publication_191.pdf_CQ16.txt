Answer:::

The criteria used to determine when training is complete varies depending on the specific parameter settings and learning policies employed. In the first context, the learning rate is decreased by a factor of 10 when the validation set accuracy stops improving. This implies that the validation set accuracy is being monitored during training, and if it fails to improve after a certain number of iterations, the learning rate is reduced to promote further learning. In this case, the training process continues until the learning rate can no longer be decreased.

In contrast, the second context describes a different set of criteria for determining when training is complete. Here, the learning rate is initially set to 10âˆ’3 for all layers, but it is decreased by a factor of 10 every 20K iterations and training is stopped after 100K iterations. This indicates that the training process is set to run for a fixed number of iterations, regardless of the validation set accuracy or loss.

It's important to note that both of these approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages. The first approach allows the model to continue learning until it can no longer improve, but it may lead to overfitting if the learning rate is not decreased at the right time. The second approach prevents overfitting by setting a limit on the number of iterations, but it may not allow the model to learn optimally if the learning rate is not decreased sufficiently.

Therefore, the criteria used to determine when training is complete depend on the specific learning policy and parameter settings employed. Common criteria include monitoring the validation set accuracy or loss, setting a fixed number of iterations, and adjusting the learning rate based on the model's performance.
