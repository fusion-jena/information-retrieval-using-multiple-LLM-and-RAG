Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text does not mention any specific techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization.

However, it does provide information about the hardware configurations used for the experiments and the training times of different models. It can be inferred that some level of hyperparameter tuning was performed to achieve these results, as different models have different default hyperparameters that can significantly impact their performance.

In addition, the context discusses the impact of data split on the final accuracy of wetland mapping. This involves evaluating the classification results of the proposed model with different training data ratios. While this is not explicitly optimizing hyperparameters, it is a form of model tuning that can affect the performance of the model.

Overall, while the specific method of hyperparameter optimization is not provided in the context, it can be inferred that some level of tuning was performed to achieve the results presented.
