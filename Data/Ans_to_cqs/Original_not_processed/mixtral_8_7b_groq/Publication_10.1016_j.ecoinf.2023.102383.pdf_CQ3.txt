Answer:

The context provided discusses the use of deer annotation in a deep learning pipeline, but it does not explicitly mention the specific techniques used such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it can be inferred that bounding box annotation was used in this case.

Bounding box annotation is a common data annotation technique where rectangular boxes are drawn around objects of interest in an image. This is evident in the context where it mentions "The 72 deer are annotated by ImageLab as shown in the right image" and Fig. 10 shows images with deer annotated using bounding boxes.

Instance segmentation, on the other hand, involves labeling each pixel of an object in an image, providing a more detailed and precise annotation compared to bounding box annotation. The context does not mention or imply the use of instance segmentation.

Moreover, the context also discusses the use of feature maps and anchor boxes in the deep learning pipeline. Feature maps are extracted from original images using CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to identify potential objects of interest and locate their rough positions within an image. Anchor boxes then generate regions of interest (RoIs) and facilitate bounding box regression, refining RoIs to better match the bounding box of the objects of interest.

In summary, based on the provided context, bounding box annotation is used in the deep learning pipeline for deer annotation. There is no mention or implication of the use of instance segmentation.
