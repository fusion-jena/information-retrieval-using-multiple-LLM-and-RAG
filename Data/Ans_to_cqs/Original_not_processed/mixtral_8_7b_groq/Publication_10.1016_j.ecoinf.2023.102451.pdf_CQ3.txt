The provided context does not give specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this particular study. However, I can provide some general information about common data annotation techniques used in deep learning.

Annotation is an essential step in deep learning projects, especially for computer vision tasks, as it helps the model understand and learn from the data. There are various annotation techniques, and the choice of technique depends on the specific task and the level of detail required. Here are some common data annotation techniques:

1. Image-level annotation: In this technique, images are annotated at the image level, meaning the entire image is assigned a single label. This is the simplest form of annotation and is often used for image classification tasks.

2. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a bounding box around objects of interest in an image. It provides more precise location information than image-level annotation and is commonly used for object detection tasks.

3. Semantic segmentation: In semantic segmentation, each pixel in an image is assigned a class label. This technique provides detailed information about the location and shape of objects and is often used for image segmentation and scene understanding tasks.

4. Instance segmentation: This technique is an extension of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and assigned a unique identifier. It is used for tasks that require identifying and distinguishing individual objects within an image, such as counting objects or tracking object movement.

5. Landmark annotation: In this technique, key points or landmarks are identified and marked on objects within an image. It is often used for tasks that require understanding the spatial relationships between objects, such as facial recognition or human pose estimation.

Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline for environmental microorganism classification involves using a dataset (EMDS-6) with microscopic images of different microorganisms. The images are divided into a training set for training the EMViT-Net model. However, the specific data annotation technique used for this study is not mentioned.
