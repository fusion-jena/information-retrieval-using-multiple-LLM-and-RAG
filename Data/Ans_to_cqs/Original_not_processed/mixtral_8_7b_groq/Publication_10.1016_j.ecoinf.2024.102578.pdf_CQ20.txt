Answer:::
The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions that the models were trained using the keras package in R with a TensorFlow backend, but it does not specify whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware accelerators were used. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question.
