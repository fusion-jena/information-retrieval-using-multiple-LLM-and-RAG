The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the model training and testing processes were repeated for 1000 iterations, utilizing distinct sample sets each time. It is possible that the training was completed after a certain number of iterations or epochs, or perhaps based on some other criterion such as a plateau in validation loss or accuracy. Without more information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
