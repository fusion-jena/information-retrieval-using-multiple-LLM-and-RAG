Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of images in the context of color blindness and creating color blind-friendly visualizations.

In the field of deep learning, various data formats can be used depending on the specific task and model. Common data formats include images, audio, video, and structured data (such as CSV files).

Images are often used in tasks such as object detection, image segmentation, and image classification. These images can be in various formats, such as JPEG, PNG, or TIFF.

Audio data can be used in tasks related to speech recognition, music information retrieval, and other audio-related applications. Audio data is typically stored in formats like WAV, MP3, or FLAC.

Video data is used in applications such as video action recognition, object tracking in videos, and video summarization. Video data is usually stored in formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV.

Structured data, often stored in CSV files, is used in tasks such as regression, classification, and time series forecasting.

In summary, while the provided context does not discuss deep learning pipelines specifically, it is clear that various data formats, including images, audio, video, and CSV files, can be used in deep learning, depending on the task and model.
