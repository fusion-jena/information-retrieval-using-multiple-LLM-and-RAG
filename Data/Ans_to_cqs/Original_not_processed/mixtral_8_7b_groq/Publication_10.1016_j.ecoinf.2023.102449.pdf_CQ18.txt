Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is likely being monitored using validation data, which is a common practice in machine learning. 

The architecture of the model is based on BirdNetâ€™s encoder, which suggests that the training process might be similar to that of BirdNet. In the BirdNet study, the model's performance was monitored by setting aside a portion of the data for validation. This validation set was used to compute the model's accuracy and loss at the end of each training epoch. This information would have been useful to adjust the learning rate, early stop the training, or apply other strategies to improve the model's performance.

Moreover, the use of batch normalization and wide residual networks also suggests a strategy to monitor and control the model's performance. Batch normalization not only helps to mitigate internal covariate shift and stabilize training but also allows the use of higher learning rates, which can speed up training and reduce power usage. The use of wider networks with fewer layers (Wide ResNets) can also help to speed up training due to shallower architectures. These techniques would have been useful to control the model's complexity and prevent overfitting, which are crucial aspects of model performance monitoring.

Finally, the use of rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation functions in the hidden layers is a strategy to monitor and improve model performance. ReLU activation functions are computationally efficient and help to prevent the vanishing gradient problem, which can hinder training and lead to poor model performance.

In conclusion, while the specific strategy for monitoring the model's performance during training is not provided, it can be inferred that the authors used a combination of techniques, including validation data, batch normalization, wide residual networks, and ReLU activation functions, to monitor and control the model's performance.
