Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves several steps. First, the dataset for each period was divided into training, testing, and validation sets in a ratio of 70:20:10, respectively. This division of data allowed for the model's performance to be evaluated at different stages of training.

During the training phase, the accuracy calculation was performed for each model trained on the corresponding period using the sklearn library. The models were trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and the output value of each neuron was calculated using the formula âˆ‘n zi = f (wjxj + bi), where zi is the output value of the i-th neuron, wj is the convolution weight for input value xj, bi is the bias, and f is the activation function.

The Pooling Layer, a crucial component of the CNN, performs data downsampling, reducing dimensionality, and extracting essential features. The most common pooling method is max pooling, which selects the maximum value from a region of input data. Pooling helps reduce the number of parameters and computations, enhances invariance to small shifts and scale changes, and improves the model's generalization ability.

The performance of the model was evaluated using various spectral indices, including Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Green-Red Vegetation Index (GRVI), Built-up Index (BU), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and others. These indices were calculated using specific formulae, such as NDVI = Nir (cid:0) Red / (Nir + Red), where Nir and Red represent the Near-Infrared and Red bands, respectively.

Finally, the land use and land cover change matrix for 2005-2015 was created, which shows the changes in land use and land cover in different categories, such as Croplands (CPL), Grasslands (GSL), High vegetation (HV), Bare lands (BL), Shrublands (SBL), Bare soils (BSL), Urban lands (URL), and Water (WTR). This matrix provides a comprehensive view of the model's performance in monitoring land use and land cover changes over time.

Therefore, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves dividing the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets, using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Pooling Layer, evaluating the model's performance using various spectral indices, and creating a land use and land cover change matrix.
