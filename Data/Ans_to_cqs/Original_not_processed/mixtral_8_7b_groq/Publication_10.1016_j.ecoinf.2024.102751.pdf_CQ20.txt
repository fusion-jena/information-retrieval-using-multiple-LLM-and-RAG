Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that exploring machine learning algorithms, which could include deep neural networks, could improve the predictive power of the spatial modeling for estimating Volumetric Water Content (VWC) on a reclaimed spoil heap. Therefore, it is likely that the researchers used hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to accelerate the training of deep learning models. These hardware resources are commonly used for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel computations, which significantly speeds up the training process compared to using a Central Processing Unit (CPU) alone. However, the specific hardware used in this study is not specified in the context.
