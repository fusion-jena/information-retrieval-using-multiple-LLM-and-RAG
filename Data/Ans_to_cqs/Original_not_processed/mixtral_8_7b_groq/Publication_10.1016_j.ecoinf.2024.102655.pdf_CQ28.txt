The provided context does not contain information about the use of deep learning models. The text mentions machine learning models in several sections, but it does not specify which platform was used to deploy them, if any. It is possible that the machine learning models were implemented and trained using local resources, or through a platform that is not specified in the text. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query with the information given.
