Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The text discusses a study that uses linear mixed modeling (LMM) to analyze the influence of season, habitat, survey type, and survey method on the number of species detected. However, it does not mention any details about model performance monitoring during the training phase.

Another source mentioned is a study that used automated bioacoustic recorders to replace human wildlife surveys. While this study uses a different methodology and context from the LMM study, it also does not provide information about model performance monitoring during training.

In general, monitoring model performance during training is an important aspect of machine learning and statistical modeling. Techniques such as cross-validation, early stopping, and learning curve analysis can be used to assess model performance and prevent overfitting. However, without additional information from the provided context, it is not possible to determine if any of these techniques were used in the LMM study.
