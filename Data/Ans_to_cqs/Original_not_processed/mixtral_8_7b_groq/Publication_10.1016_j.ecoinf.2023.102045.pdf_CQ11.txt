Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a specific data repository link such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The article by Rocchini et al. focuses on the development of the R package "cblindplot" to help color-blind individuals visualize spatial patterns in ecological data. They discuss the importance of accessible scientific maps and communication, particularly for scholars and students with color blindness. However, they do not present a deep learning pipeline or associated data repository in this article.
