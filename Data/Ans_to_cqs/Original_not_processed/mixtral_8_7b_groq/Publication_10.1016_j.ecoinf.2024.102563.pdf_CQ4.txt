The provided context does not directly discuss data augmentation techniques in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does contain information about various methods used for image classification and digital soil mapping.

In the context of image classification, Saboori et al., 2019 and Lu et al., 2010 have used multi-scale textural features from high spatial resolution images in combination with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), and Random Forest (RF) algorithms for urban land use extraction. Similarly, Sheykhmousa et al., 2020 compared Support Vector Machine (SVM) and SVM with multi-textural features for land use/land cover classification. These studies show the importance of feature extraction and selection in image classification tasks.

In the context of digital soil mapping, Mohammadi and Toomanian, 2016 used Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for database extension. Liu et al., 2020 presented a graded proportion method for training sample selection to update conventional soil maps. These studies highlight the significance of data preprocessing and training sample selection in digital soil mapping.

Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for image classification tasks. These techniques help increase the size of the training dataset, reduce overfitting, and improve model generalization.

Flipping involves horizontally or vertically flipping the image, which helps the model learn features invariant to orientation. Rotating the image at different angles helps the model learn features invariant to rotation. Scaling involves changing the size of the image, which helps the model learn features invariant to scale. These techniques can be applied during training to generate new synthetic samples from the original dataset.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not directly discuss data augmentation techniques, they are essential components of deep learning pipelines for image classification tasks. Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling help improve model generalization and reduce overfitting.
