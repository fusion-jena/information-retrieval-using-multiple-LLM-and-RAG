Answer:
In the context provided, the data for deep learning model training is split using specific criteria. For the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, 80% of the samples were used for training, and the remaining 20% were used for testing. This strategy is commonly used to enhance the generalization of a machine learning model and prevent overfitting.

Additionally, a balanced sampling approach was carried out for the test set. Specifically, one audio sample (along with its corresponding data augmentation samples) was selected out of five for each type of anuran call. As a result, 7623 samples were used for training, and 1892 samples were used for testing.

It is important to note that the data splitting criteria were applied before training the first CNN for the initial four sound classes. Afterward, a second CNN was trained to expand the classification system to include a total of five classes.

Furthermore, the number of epochs and batch size were also specified as criteria for the training process. For the first network, the best results were obtained with training in only eight epochs and a batch size equal to 32. For the second network, the best training was achieved with six epochs and, again, a batch size equal to 32.

Overall, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this context include the percentage of samples for training and testing, balanced sampling, and the number of epochs and batch size for the training process.
