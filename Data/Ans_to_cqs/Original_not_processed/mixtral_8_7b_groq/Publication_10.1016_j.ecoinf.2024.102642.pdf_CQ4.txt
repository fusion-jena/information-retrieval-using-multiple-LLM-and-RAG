Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation is a common technique used to increase the size and diversity of training datasets in deep learning by applying various transformations to the existing data. However, the context focuses mainly on the use of multi-annotation campaigns, inter-annotator variability assessment, and annotation set aggregation methods to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cetacean vocalization detection.

In the study, the authors worked with two distinct sets of annotations: those created by novice annotators and those created by an expert annotator. They trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on these annotations to address annotation discrepancies and evaluate the performance of the CNNs. To optimize the potential of multi-annotation and mitigate the presence of noisy labels, two annotation aggregation methods (majority voting and soft labeling) were proposed and tested.

The evaluation of the CNNs' performance involved using datasets containing other SEIO PBW vocalizations and blue whale's Dcall. A small portion of these datasets was used to reduce computational time. The recordings used for the evaluation of the SEIO PBW vocalizations were sourced from the SWAMS site, located in the Indian Ocean's oceanic zone, between Kerguelen and Amsterdam Island. These recordings were collected at a depth of 1000 m with a sampling rate of 240 Hz.

In summary, while data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, the provided context does not mention their application in this specific study. The focus of the study is on addressing annotation discrepancies and improving annotation quality through multi-annotation campaigns, inter-annotator variability assessment, and annotation set aggregation methods.
