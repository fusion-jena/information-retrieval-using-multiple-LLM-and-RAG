Answer:::

The article does not provide specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that eight deep learning algorithms were employed for bird object detection and their performance was evaluated. Therefore, it can be inferred that the models were likely serialized, or saved, after training so that they could be deployed and tested on new data. 

In terms of platform selection, the article mentions that the dataset was acquired by camera traps in Chinaâ€™s Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park. This suggests that the trained models may have been deployed on a system located in or near the park for real-time bird detection. However, the specific platform or hardware used for deployment is not mentioned in the article.

Additionally, the article highlights the importance of choosing appropriate training times for different models to save computing resources. This suggests that the researchers may have considered the computational requirements and resources available when deploying the models.

Overall, while the article does not provide specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning models, it can be inferred that the models were likely serialized and deployed on a system located in or near the park for real-time bird detection. The researchers may have also considered the computational requirements and resources available when deploying the models.
