Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data into training, testing, and validation sets. However, it does mention that the datasets were split into train and test sets in an 8:2 ratio. This means that 80% of the data was used for training, and the remaining 20% was used for testing. There is no mention of a validation set in the provided context.

In addition, the context describes an experimental group that involves taking 40%, 60%, and 80% of the original dataset as the new dataset and then replacing 80% of these three datasets with generated images. However, it does not specify whether these subsets were further divided into training, testing, and validation sets.

It is important to note that the process of splitting the data into training, testing, and validation sets is a crucial step in deep learning model development. This process helps to ensure that the model can generalize well to new, unseen data. Typically, the data is split into three sets: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

There are various strategies for splitting the data, including random sampling, stratified sampling, and k-fold cross-validation. Random sampling involves randomly selecting a certain percentage of the data for each set. Stratified sampling involves dividing the data into strata based on certain criteria, such as class labels, and then randomly selecting a certain percentage of the data from each stratum for each set. K-fold cross-validation involves dividing the data into k folds, where each fold is used as the test set once, and the remaining k-1 folds are used as the training set.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it does mention that the datasets were split into train and test sets in an 8:2 ratio. The process of splitting the data into training, testing, and validation sets is a crucial step in deep learning model development, and there are various strategies for splitting the data.
