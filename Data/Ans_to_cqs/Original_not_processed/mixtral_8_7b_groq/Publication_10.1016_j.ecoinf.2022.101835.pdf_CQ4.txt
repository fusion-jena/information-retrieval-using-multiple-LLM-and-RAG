Based on the provided context, there is no information about data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the optimization of machine learning models, specifically Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) models, using Optuna for hyperparameter tuning. The parameters and ranges for these models are described, but there is no mention of data augmentation techniques.

The models' performance is evaluated based on the loss function (mean squared error), mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination (R2). The optimized ANN models did not have any intermediate layers, and the best model was determined to be the one with an input layer followed by the output layer.

In addition, the context discusses the calculation of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values for each explanatory variable to evaluate the magnitude of the effect on the response value. However, there is no information about data augmentation techniques.
