Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for ecological prediction. However, it can be inferred that various data sources are used, such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets.

For instance, in the context of predicting bark beetle outbreaks in conifer forests, the authors use remote sensing data from Landsat satellites, which are public datasets. These datasets provide information on land cover, vegetation, and other environmental factors that can influence bark beetle outbreaks.

Additionally, the authors mention the use of statistical analyses of the data, which suggests that some form of data collection through surveys or measurements may have been conducted. However, the specific methods are not mentioned.

In the field of computational ecology and machine learning, it is common to use various data sources, including sensors, surveys, and public datasets, to collect raw data for deep learning pipelines. Sensors can include devices that measure environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. Surveys can include field observations, questionnaires, and interviews with experts. Public datasets can include data from government agencies, research institutions, and other organizations that make data available for use by the public.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data, it can be inferred that a combination of data sources is likely used in the deep learning pipeline for ecological prediction.
