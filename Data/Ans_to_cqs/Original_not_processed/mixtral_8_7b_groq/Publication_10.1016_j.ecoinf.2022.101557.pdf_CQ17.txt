Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline described in the context employs dropout as a regularization method to prevent overfitting. Specifically, dropout is used during the training of a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a rate of 0.3. This means that 30% of the neurons in the CNN are randomly dropped out during each training iteration, which helps to make the model more stable and less prone to overfitting to the training data.

In addition to dropout, the CNN is trained using a technique called ADAM optimization with a learning rate of 0.0001. While ADAM optimization is not a regularization method per se, it can help to reduce overfitting by finding optimal weights in the neural network that minimize the cross entropy loss between the network's predictions and the pre-labelled data.

It is worth noting that the context does not mention the use of any other regularization methods, such as L2 regularization or early stopping. However, the use of dropout and ADAM optimization, along with data pre-processing techniques like cross-validation and splitting the data into smaller areas, can still help to mitigate overfitting and improve the generalizability of the CNN model.
