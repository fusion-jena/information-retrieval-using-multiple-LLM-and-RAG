Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the mentioned studies. The sources only discuss the methodologies, data sources, and results of various research projects related to digital soil mapping, land cover classification, and crop identification. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket link for the deep learning pipeline code repository. If you are interested in a specific study's methodology or code, I would recommend contacting the authors directly for more information.
