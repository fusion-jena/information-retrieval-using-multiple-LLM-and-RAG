The provided context does not contain information about the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the bird identification model. The text mentions the use of machine learning algorithms for identifying bird species based on their sounds, and that these algorithms were developed using a large number of labeled recordings from Xeno-canto, a public online database. However, it does not specify which deep learning frameworks were used in the process.
