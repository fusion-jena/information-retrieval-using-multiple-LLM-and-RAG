The pieces of context provided do not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention the use of field recordings and passive acoustic monitoring, which suggest the use of audio sensors or microphones for data collection.

In the study by Sankupellay and Konovalov (2018), they used bird call recordings as the raw data for their deep convolutional neural network model. Similarly, Teixeira et al. (2022) used bioacoustic data, specifically nest monitoring recordings of endangered black-cockatoos, for their call recognition model.

Passive acoustic monitoring is also mentioned as a method for data collection in the context. Ross et al. (2023) discussed the use of passive acoustic monitoring for answering fundamental ecological questions. This method involves the use of sensors or microphones that continuously record audio in a particular environment, without any active involvement from researchers.

Therefore, it can be inferred that audio sensors or microphones are used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for call recognition tasks. Additionally, surveys or field recordings may also be used to collect data, although this is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Public datasets may also be a source of raw data for deep learning pipelines. However, the context does not mention any specific public datasets used for call recognition tasks.

In summary, while the pieces of context provided do not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, they do suggest the use of audio sensors or microphones for data collection. Additionally, surveys, field recordings, and public datasets may also be used as sources of raw data.
