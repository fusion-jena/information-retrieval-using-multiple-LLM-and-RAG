The provided context does not include specific information about the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it does offer insights into various machine learning algorithms, their parameters, and data considerations for predicting different variables.

When it comes to splitting data for model training, there are common practices in machine learning and deep learning. Generally, the dataset is divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing.

1. Training set: This portion of the data is used to train the model, enabling it to learn the underlying patterns and relationships.

2. Validation set: This subset is employed to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. By assessing the model's performance on the validation set, adjustments can be made to improve the overall model.

3. Testing set: Finally, the testing set is utilized to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. This step provides an unbiased assessment of the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

These practices are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context; however, they are generally accepted and practiced within the machine learning and deep learning communities.

In summary, the provided context does not contain specific information on the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. However, common practices involve dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets for effective model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.
