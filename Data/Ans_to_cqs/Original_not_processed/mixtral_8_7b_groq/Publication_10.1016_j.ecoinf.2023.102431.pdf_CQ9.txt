Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The study focuses on the development of a non-invasive method for species and sex identification of rare forest carnivores using footprint identification technology. The authors used Fisher and Marten species for the study and collected track data to create a dataset for discriminant analysis. However, the context does not mention where the data repository is available, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
