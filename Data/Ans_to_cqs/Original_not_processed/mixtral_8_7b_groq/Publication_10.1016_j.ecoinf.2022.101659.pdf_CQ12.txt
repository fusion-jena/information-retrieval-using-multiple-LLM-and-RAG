Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The text discusses the use of sensors and big data to study the relationship between valve gape and environmental variables in bivalves, but it does not mention any deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
