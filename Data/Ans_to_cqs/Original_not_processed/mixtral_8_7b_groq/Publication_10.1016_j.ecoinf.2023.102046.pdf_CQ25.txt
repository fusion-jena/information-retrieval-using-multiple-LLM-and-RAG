Answer:::

The deep learning models mentioned in the context are used for image classification tasks. Specifically, ResNet-50, Inception-V3, and Vision Transformer (ViT) are convolutional neural network models that classify images into different categories.

ResNet-50 is a model that uses skip connections, which made it possible to train deeper models than was previously possible. The purpose of using ResNet-50 is for comparison as it is a proven computer vision classification model that is commonly used and provides a well-performing baseline.

Inception-V3 is another convolutional neural network used for image classification. It has an auxiliary classifier that acts as a regularizer. The Inception-V3 architecture is built on previous Inception models, with the aim of making the V3 computationally efficient.

Finally, the Vision Transformer (ViT) is a deep learning model that resizes images to (224, 224) pixels and is trained using contrastive learning. The purpose of using ViT is to learn visual concepts through natural language supervision. The image encoder maps an image to a vector that can be considered a robust semantic feature representation of the image, which can transfer to diverse tasks and often perform competitively with fully supervised baselines in a zero-shot fashion.

In summary, the deep learning models mentioned in the context are used for image classification tasks. These models include ResNet-50, Inception-V3, and Vision Transformer (ViT), which are all convolutional neural network models that classify images into different categories.
