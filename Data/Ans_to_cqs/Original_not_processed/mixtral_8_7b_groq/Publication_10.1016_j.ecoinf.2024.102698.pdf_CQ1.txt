Based on the provided context, the text does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of satellite data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) for studying coral reefs and heat stress. It is also mentioned that synthetic data can be generated using classical and deep learning methods for various purposes such as promoting reproducibility, rapid testing of ecological hypotheses, and generating behavioral science datasets.

In general, raw data for deep learning can come from various sources such as:

1. Surveys: Surveys can be conducted to collect data on various variables of interest. For example, in behavioral science, surveys can be used to collect data on individual behavior, attitudes, and beliefs.
2. Sensors: Sensors can be used to collect data on various physical phenomena such as temperature, pressure, and motion. For example, in the study of coral reefs, satellite data from NOAA can be used to collect data on heat stress and wave stress.
3. Public datasets: Public datasets are often available for various domains and can be used as raw data for deep learning. For example, in the study of ecological systems, public datasets on species distribution and abundance can be used.

The choice of data collection method depends on the specific problem and the available resources. In general, it is important to ensure that the raw data is of high quality and representative of the population or phenomenon of interest.
