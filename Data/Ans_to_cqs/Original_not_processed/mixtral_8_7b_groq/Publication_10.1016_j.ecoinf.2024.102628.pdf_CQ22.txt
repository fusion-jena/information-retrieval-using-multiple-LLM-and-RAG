Answer:::
The metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model is the weighted F1 score. The F1 score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, which provides a balanced measure of both false positives and false negatives in the classification results. To calculate the F1 score, the true labels and predicted majority classes for each transect are obtained from the aggregated data. Then, the Python Scikit-learn library is used to compute the confusion matrix for the true and predicted labels, considering the three classes: "p", "w", and "r". Finally, the weighted F1 score is calculated using the f1_score function from Scikit-learn, specifying the true labels, predicted labels, and the average parameter set as "weighted". Other metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
