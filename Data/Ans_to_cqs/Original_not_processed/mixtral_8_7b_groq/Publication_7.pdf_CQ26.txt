The provided text does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss some methods used for feature extraction and image classification in the context of marine image annotation.

In the classification process, the authors use pre-trained VGGnet models and fine-tune them on the Benthoz15 dataset, which consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. This can be seen as a form of diverse data collection, as the dataset is specific to the domain of marine images and contains annotations from experts.

For the classification experiments and results, the authors train their classifier using multiple patches at different scales and achieve the best performance when using patch sizes of 28 × 28, 224 × 2
