Answer:::
The provided context discusses a machine learning study that uses covariance-weighted bagging for modeling, rather than a deep learning model. Therefore, it does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, I can provide some general measures that are commonly used to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

1. Diverse dataset: To ensure that the deep learning model can generalize well to new data, it is important to provide it with a diverse and representative training dataset. This includes data from different sources, domains, and classes.
2. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model by splitting the dataset into multiple folds. The model is then trained and tested on different subsets of the data, and the performance is averaged across all folds. This helps to reduce overfitting and provides a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.
3. Stratified splitting: Stratified splitting is a technique used to ensure that the training and testing datasets have a similar distribution of classes. This is especially important in imbalanced datasets where one class may be overrepresented. By stratifying the dataset, we can ensure that the model is trained and tested on a representative sample of each class.
4. Regularization: Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. This helps to reduce the complexity of the model and encourages it to learn more generalizable features.
5. Data augmentation: Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the existing data. This helps to improve the model's ability to generalize to new data by providing it with more diverse examples.

While the provided context does not mention these specific measures for a deep learning model, they are commonly used in machine learning to ensure the generalizability of models.
