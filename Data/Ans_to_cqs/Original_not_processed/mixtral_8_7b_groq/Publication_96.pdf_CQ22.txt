Answer:::
The text provided discusses the use of a deep learning model for mapping burned areas, and it mentions some metrics that were used to evaluate the performance of the model.

First, the model's accuracy is mentioned. Accuracy is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. It is defined as the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions made. In the context of this study, the overall accuracy of the deep learning model was 94.1%.

Additionally, the text mentions the use of a confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predictions made by a model. It compares the true class labels of the data (also known as the reference or ground truth) with the predicted class labels. From the confusion matrix, other metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score can be calculated.

Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions (correctly predicted burned areas) to the total number of positive predictions (all areas predicted as burned). It is a measure of the model's exactness. In the study, the precision of the deep learning model was 97.0%.

Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances in the data. It is a measure of the model's completeness. In the study, the recall of the deep learning model was 70.1%.

The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it provides a single metric that balances both precision and recall. It is a more robust metric than accuracy, especially when the classes are imbalanced. However, the text does not provide the F1-score for the deep learning model.

Therefore, based on the provided text, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, precision, and recall.
