The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions that the ANN models were implemented using the Keras library, but it does not specify if GPUs, TPUs, or any other specific hardware accelerators were used during the training process. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
