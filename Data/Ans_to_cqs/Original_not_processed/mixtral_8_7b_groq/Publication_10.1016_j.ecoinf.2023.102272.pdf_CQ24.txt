Answer:::

The text provided does not explicitly mention the use of a specific random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe a model selection procedure that includes elements of randomness and strategies to manage it.

In the model selection procedure, the authors randomly generate five models for each of the four available deep-ANN architecture types, totaling 20 models. These models are then trained with a small subset of the training data for four epochs. The accuracy of candidate models is compared using a left-out validation data set, and the model with the highest performance is selected for training on the full training data for up to 30 epochs.

This approach incorporates randomness by generating different models with potentially different initial weights. By comparing the performance of these models on a validation data set, the authors reduce the risk of overfitting or selecting a model that performs well by chance. This strategy helps ensure that the selected model generalizes well to new data.

In addition, the use of a deep Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (DeepConvLSTM) architecture and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture suggests that the authors are employing strategies to handle temporal and spatial dependencies in their data, which can also help manage randomness. These architectures are designed to capture patterns and trends in sequential data, which can improve model performance and reduce the impact of randomness.

Overall, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, it does describe a model selection procedure that incorporates randomness and strategies to manage it, as well as the use of architectures designed to handle temporal and spatial dependencies in the data.
