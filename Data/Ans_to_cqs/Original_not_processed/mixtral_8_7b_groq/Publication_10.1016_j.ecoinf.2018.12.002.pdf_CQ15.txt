The provided context discusses the use of machine learning algorithms, including random forests and support vector machines, in the classification of animal behavior based on acceleration data. However, it does not directly mention the optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.

In general, optimization techniques are used in deep learning to adjust the weights and biases of the neural network during training, with the goal of minimizing the loss function and improving the model's performance. Some common optimization techniques include:

* Stochastic gradient descent (SGD): This is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the weights and biases of the neural network by taking a step in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function.
* Momentum: This is a technique that can be added to SGD to improve convergence by incorporating the past gradients into the update.
* Adagrad: This is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradient information.
* Adadelta: This is an extension of Adagrad that uses a running average of squared gradients instead of the historical gradient information.
* Adam: This is an optimization algorithm that combines the ideas from Adagrad and momentum to adapt the learning rate for each parameter.

It is important to note that the provided context is about the use of machine learning algorithms in the classification of animal behavior, and not about deep learning specifically. Therefore, it does not mention any optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
