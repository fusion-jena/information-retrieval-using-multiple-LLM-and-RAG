Answer:::

In the deep learning pipeline for classifying soundscape recordings into bird species, the datasets used are not specifically named as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, a crucial role is played by a large image database called ImageNet. This dataset is used for pre-training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, such as Inception, MobileNet, and Resnet50, before they are fine-tuned for the specific task of bird species classification in soundscape recordings.

ImageNet contains over one million samples distributed across 1000 classes. Pre-training on such a diverse and extensive dataset enables the CNN models to learn powerful feature extractors that can be later utilized for the target task.

In cases where the main task is to target foreground species or when dealing with more acoustically sparse soundscapes, CNN architectures with fewer (<10) convolutional layers have proven to be sufficient. This is because the raw audio data is represented in the form of spectrograms, which are essentially three-dimensional images with temporal information on the horizontal axis, frequency increasing along the vertical axis, and sound power level represented by color.

The use of pre-trained models like ResNet50 and Inception for this specific task did not yield significant improvements in classification performance. Therefore, a simpler architecture, similar to those implemented by Ruff et al., 2020; Sprengel et al., 2016, was employed instead.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline for classifying bird species in soundscape recordings uses the ImageNet dataset for pre-training CNN architectures. These models are then fine-tuned for the specific task, making use of the power of transfer learning.
