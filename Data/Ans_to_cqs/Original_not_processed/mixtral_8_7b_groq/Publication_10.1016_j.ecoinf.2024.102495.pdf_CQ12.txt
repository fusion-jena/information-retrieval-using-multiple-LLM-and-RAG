Answer:::
The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This information can be inferred from the context provided in the first piece of text, which mentions that the study uses a CNN to process two or more dimensions of data with high complexity. Additionally, Table 3 in the context provides details about the configurations of the CNN used in the study. The text also mentions that the CNN consists of several parts, including the feature extraction layer and the fully connected layer, which are used to extract features from the given input data and perform the classification process, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN.
