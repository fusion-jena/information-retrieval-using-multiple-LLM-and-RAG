The provided context does not give information about the specific deep learning model used in the study. However, it does mention the use of a Transfer Update Rule (TUR) and two models, GRNN and SVR, used in conjunction with IFTL (Incremental Fuzzy Transfer Learning) for GDP prediction based on CO2 emission data.

The context also mentions the use of a hyperparameter gamma (γ) in the IFTL implementation, which is kept constant at 10% for all experiments. This hyperparameter is used in the calculation of δPjF, which is the prediction difference between the fuzzy intuitionistic prediction and the TUR prediction.

As for the deep learning model, the context does not provide information on the learning rate or optimizer used. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
