The provided context includes a portion of a research paper that discusses the evaluation of a deep learning model for a classification task. However, it does not explicitly list the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.

However, based on the common practice in evaluating classification models, we can infer that the following metrics were likely used:

1. Accuracy: This is the most common metric for evaluating classification models. It measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions made.
2. Precision: This metric measures the proportion of true positive predictions (correctly labeled positive instances) out of all positive predictions made.
3. Recall: This metric measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances in the data.
4. F1-score: This metric is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and provides a balanced assessment of both metrics.
5. Confusion matrix: This is a table that summarizes the predictions made by the model, including the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

The context mentions that the deep learning model was trained and tested on a dataset of 261 instances, and that it achieved a high level of performance. However, without the specific evaluation metrics, it is difficult to quantify the exact level of performance.

Therefore, based on the provided context and common practice in evaluating classification models, we can infer that the deep learning model was likely evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix. However, the exact values of these metrics are not provided in the context.
