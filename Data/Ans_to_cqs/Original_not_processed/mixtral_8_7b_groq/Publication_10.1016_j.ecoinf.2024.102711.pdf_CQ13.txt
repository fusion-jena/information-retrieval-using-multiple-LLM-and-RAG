Based on the provided context, the hyperparameters mentioned are for data-driven models, specifically for Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost. The hyperparameters mentioned for these models include:

For Random Forest:
- Maximum depth
- Number of estimators
- Learning rate

For XGBoost:
- Maximum depth
- Number of estimators
- Learning rate

However, the context does not mention any hyperparameters for deep learning models such as learning rate or optimizer. Deep learning models have different hyperparameters compared to RF and XGBoost. Some examples of hyperparameters for deep learning models include:

- Learning rate
- Number of layers
- Number of neurons in each layer
- Type of optimizer
- Type of activation function
- Batch size
- Number of epochs

Therefore, the context does not provide enough information to answer the query regarding the hyperparameters used in deep learning models.
