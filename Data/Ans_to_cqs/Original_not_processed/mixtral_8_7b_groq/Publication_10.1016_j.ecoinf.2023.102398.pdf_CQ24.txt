Answer:

The provided context discusses various aspects of deep learning models, including the SENet attention mechanism, training hyperparameters, and performance metrics. However, it does not directly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline using techniques such as random seed values.

In general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines is crucial for ensuring reproducibility and stability of training. One common method to control randomness is by setting a fixed random seed value. This ensures that the random number generator used in the deep learning framework produces the same sequence of random numbers in every run, leading to consistent results.

The following are some ways randomness can be managed in deep learning:

1. **Initialization of weights**: Deep learning models typically initialize weights randomly. By setting a fixed random seed value, the same set of initial weights will be used in every run, ensuring consistent training behavior.
2. **Data shuffling**: During training, data is often shuffled to ensure that the model does not overfit to a particular order of the training data. By setting a fixed random seed, the same shuffled order will be used across different runs.
3. **Dropout**: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent overfitting. A fixed random seed ensures consistent neuron selection across runs.
4. **Batch normalization**: Batch normalization scales and recenters the inputs of each batch. The randomness in this process can be controlled using a fixed random seed.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these strategies, it does discuss techniques that can be influenced by randomness, such as data shuffling and weight initialization. It is reasonable to assume that deep learning practitioners would employ strategies to manage randomness when implementing these techniques.
