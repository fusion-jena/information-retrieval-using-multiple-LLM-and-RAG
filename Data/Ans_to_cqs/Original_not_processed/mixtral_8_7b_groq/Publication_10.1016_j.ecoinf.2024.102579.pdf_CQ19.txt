Based on the provided context, there is no information suggesting that a deep learning model was built or which framework was used to build it, if one was constructed. The text discusses the use of the NN3 and NN4 estimators in the context of continuous forest cover and ecological informatics. However, these are not deep learning models but rather types of inventory estimators.

The NN1 and NN2 estimators are also mentioned, but there is no indication that these are deep learning models. Instead, they are described as methods for estimating forest attributes based on sample data.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as there is no information provided in the context to support an answer.
