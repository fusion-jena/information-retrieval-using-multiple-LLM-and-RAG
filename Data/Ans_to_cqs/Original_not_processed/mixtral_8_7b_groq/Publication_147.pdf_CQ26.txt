Answer:::

The provided context discusses a study comparing shallow learning (XGB) and deep learning (CNN) methods for wetland classification, but it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the data used for training and validation includes two datasets generated from photo interpretation and one field validation dataset. This suggests that the researchers may have employed diverse data collection techniques to minimize bias.

In general, there are several techniques commonly used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain characteristics (e.g., class labels) and then randomly selecting samples from each subgroup to ensure that each subset is representative of the overall population.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of samples in underrepresented classes to balance the dataset. This can be done by duplicating existing samples or by generating synthetic samples using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of samples in overrepresented classes to balance the dataset. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of samples from the overrepresented classes.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources, locations, and conditions to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help to minimize bias and improve the generalizability of the model.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, it is possible that they were employed during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. It is also possible that other techniques were used to address data bias. Without further information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to this query.
