Answer:::
The provided context does not give a specific link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. However, it does mention that the deep neural network algorithm (IUC-NN) was implemented as an R package (IUCNN) available on GitHub at <https://github.com/azizka/IUCNN>. The study used occurrence records of the Orchidaceae family, which can be digitally accessed. The occurrence records were used to derive four groups of features: geographic, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic. The geographic features were derived from mean latitude and longitude, longitudinal and latitudinal range, extent of occurrence (EOO), area of occupancy (AOO), number of locations, and occurrence records. The climatic features were derived from 19 bioclim variables. The biome features were derived from presence in 14 biomes, and the anthropogenic features were derived from the mean Human Footprint Index. While the exact data repository for the pipeline is not provided, the study does offer transparency in its methodology and data processing through the IUCNN R package and the references to the data sources.
