Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of any deep learning pipelines or datasets commonly used in deep learning tasks such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, the context does discuss the usage of several remote sensing and forest inventory datasets in the context of ecological informatics and biomass estimation.

The study "EcologicalInformatics81(2024)10256613" utilizes field-collected data, forest inventory data, and remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation. Specifically, it employs the GIMMS NDVI3g dataset to downscale forest inventory data spanning from 1989 to 2018, creating a 1 km resolution map of forest biomass density in the Qinba Mountains.

Additionally, the study "Bortolot, Z.J., Wynne, R.H., 2005. Estimating forest biomass using small footprint LiDAR data: an individual tree-based approach that incorporates training data" uses small footprint LiDAR data for estimating forest biomass.

Lastly, the study "Chen, T.R., 2007. Research on the forest biomass and carbon storage in Xiaolong" discusses the usage of forest inventory data for researching forest biomass and carbon storage.

Therefore, while the context does not directly mention any deep learning datasets, it does provide information on the usage of remote sensing and forest inventory datasets in the context of ecological informatics and biomass estimation.
