Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the researchers might have used some regularization techniques to avoid overfitting, as they have mentioned the importance of preventing overfitting in the model training process.

Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used techniques to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the model more robust and less prone to overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from assigning too much importance to any single feature, thereby reducing overfitting.

The context mentions that the model was trained for 20,000 epochs, and further training would have either resulted in overfitting or no further drop in losses. This statement suggests that the researchers might have used early stopping, another regularization technique that involves stopping the training process when the validation loss stops decreasing or starts increasing, to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, while the specific regularization methods used in this study are not mentioned in the provided context, it is likely that the researchers used a combination of techniques like dropout, L2 regularization, and early stopping to prevent overfitting in their deep learning pipeline.
