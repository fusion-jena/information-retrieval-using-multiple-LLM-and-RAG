Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline described in the given context uses primarily tabular data in the form of CSV files. The research focuses on Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and employs a new loss function tailored for these models. The data used in this pipeline consists of species occurrence records and environmental variables, both of which are typically represented in tabular format.

The authors mention their intention to expand the research to various types of data, including environmental rasters, satellite images, and time series data. However, the current pipeline primarily works with tabular data. Environmental rasters and satellite images are types of gridded data, which can be converted into raster or matrix formats, similar to tabular data. Time series data, on the other hand, can be represented as a table with each row containing a specific time point and corresponding variable values.

The context does not explicitly mention the use of other data formats, such as image, audio, or video files. While the authors allude to exploring more complex neural network architectures, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, which are commonly used for image, audio, and video processing, the primary focus remains on the aforementioned tabular data for SDMs.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline discussed in the provided context primarily works with tabular data in CSV format, with plans to explore other formats such as environmental rasters, satellite images, and time series data. Other formats, such as image, audio, or video files, are not explicitly mentioned in the context.
