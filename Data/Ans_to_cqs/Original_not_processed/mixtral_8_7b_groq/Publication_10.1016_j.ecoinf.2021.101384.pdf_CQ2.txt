Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in question uses standardized NetCDF files for geospatial data. NetCDF (Network Common Data Form) is a set of software libraries and machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented scientific data. It is commonly used in Earth system sciences and other fields that require handling large volumes of multidimensional data.

In this specific case, the NetCDF files contain geospatial data related to fishing activity, which is one of the focus areas of the study. The Global Fishing Watch (GFW) organization provides global-scale fishing data for the 2012-2016 period, which are downloadable for scientific purposes. These data are already aggregated at a 0.01-degree resolution, with fishing activity cells classified through a machine learning model.

It is worth noting that the deep learning pipeline is part of a workflow that implements a FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) approach, which facilitates data FAIRness through the indexing of resources in the D4Science catalogue. This catalogue can be accessed by all processes via the Catalogue Services for the Web (CSW) standard of the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention other data formats such as image, audio, or video, it does confirm that standardized NetCDF files are used for geospatial data in the deep learning pipeline.
