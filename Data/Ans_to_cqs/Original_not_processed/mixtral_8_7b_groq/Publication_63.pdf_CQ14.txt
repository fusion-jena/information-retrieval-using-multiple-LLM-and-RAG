Answer:::

The context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. The text mentions the hyperparameters used for the training process, such as a batch size of 20 images, RMSprop optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and a learning rate decay of 0.0001, the mean squared error loss function, and the MAE for prediction accuracy quantification. However, it does not specify whether a systematic approach like grid search or random search was used to find the optimal values for these hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given context.
