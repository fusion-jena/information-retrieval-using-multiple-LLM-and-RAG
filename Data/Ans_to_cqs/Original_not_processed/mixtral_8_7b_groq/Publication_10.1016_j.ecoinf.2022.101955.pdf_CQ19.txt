Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention which framework was used to build the deep learning model. The text only specifies that the "nnet" package in R was used for building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. However, "nnet" is not a deep learning framework; it is a general-purpose machine learning package for R that includes an implementation of a basic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network.

Deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras provide more sophisticated tools for building and training deep neural networks. These frameworks offer advanced features such as automatic differentiation, large-scale matrix operations, and support for GPU acceleration.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine whether a deep learning framework was used to build the model.
