Answer:::

The provided context does not mention any specific hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs being used for training a deep learning model. Instead, it describes the use of the DAFNE HPC scientific computing center of the Universit`a degli Studi della Tuscia for computing tasks. The center provides two Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) ProLiant DL560 Gen10 nodes, each equipped with four Intel Xeon Gold 5118 2.30GHz processors, 12 cores, 24 threads, and 512 GB of RAM. The two nodes worked in a parallel configuration managed by the Python 3.6.8 package Ray, version 1.9.2.

The study focuses on the combination of Least Squares (LS) method and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for the physiologically based model parameter estimation. The authors used a genetic algorithm for preliminary exploration of the space of the parameters and provided a preliminary optimization of the parameter values. Then, the MCMC algorithm was used to tune the parameter estimation, providing the statistical distribution and the uncertainty associated with every single parameter.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it appears that the study did not involve training a deep learning model, and no information is given about the use of hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs.
