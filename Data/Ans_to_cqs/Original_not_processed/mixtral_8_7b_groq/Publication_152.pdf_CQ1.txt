Answer:::

The text provided discusses the use of a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) or drone equipped with a Global Positioning System (GPS) to collect image data for training a deep learning model to identify a specific invasive plant species, Hedychium Coronarium.

According to the text, a DJI Phantom 2 drone was used to gather images for the study. This suggests that the method utilized for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline is the use of sensors, specifically a camera mounted on a drone.

The text does not mention the use of surveys or public datasets for collecting raw data in this particular deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data are limited to the use of sensors, specifically a camera mounted on a drone.

It's worth noting that the use of sensors, such as cameras, is a common method for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines related to computer vision tasks. Other examples of sensors that can be used for collecting raw data include LiDAR sensors, radar, and thermal sensors. The choice of sensor depends on the specific task and the type of data required to train the model.

In summary, based on the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for identifying Hedychium Coronarium include the use of sensors, specifically a camera mounted on a drone.
