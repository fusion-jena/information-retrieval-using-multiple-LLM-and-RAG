Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various studies and papers related to deep learning and automated machine learning (AutoML), but it does not mention where the code for these studies is hosted. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query. If the code repository is mentioned in one of the provided sources, it was not apparent enough to answer the query. I would recommend checking the authors' websites or contacting them directly for more information about the code repository.
