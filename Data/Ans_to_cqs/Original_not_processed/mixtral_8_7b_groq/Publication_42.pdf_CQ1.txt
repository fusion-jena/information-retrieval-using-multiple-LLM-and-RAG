Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in the context provided begins with the collection of raw data through surveys. The surveys involved capturing sequences of images over a period of observation. From these sequences, individual insect images were selected to create a dataset. The dataset was created by ensuring sufficient samples for each class, which involved selecting images with different orientations of the same individual. However, the specific details about the survey methods, such as the location, duration, and equipment used for capturing the images, are not provided in the context. Therefore, we cannot answer this part of the query comprehensively.

The context also does not mention any public datasets being used in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in the provided context involves collecting raw data through surveys, where sequences of images are captured, and individual insect images are selected to create a dataset. However, the specific details about the survey methods are not provided. Public datasets do not appear to have been used in this pipeline.
