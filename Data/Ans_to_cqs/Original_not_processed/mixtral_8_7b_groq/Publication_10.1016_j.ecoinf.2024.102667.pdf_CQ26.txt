The provided articles do not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, they do discuss methods for handling data in the context of analyzing vegetation changes and climate change impacts. These methods could potentially be adapted for addressing data bias in a deep learning context.

One such method is stratified sampling, which is mentioned in the context of assessing the lagged and cumulative effects of drought on grassland gross primary production (Wei et al., 2022). Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into homogeneous subgroups (strata) and then selecting a sample from each subgroup. This technique can help ensure that the sample is representative of the entire population, reducing bias.

Another method is the use of control areas or unchanged land use/cover types, as demonstrated in the study on unintended consequences of combating desertification in China (Su et al., 2023). By comparing changed and unchanged areas, the study accounts for the impact of human activities and climate change on vegetation changes, providing a more accurate assessment of the actual effects of desertification control measures.

In the context of deep learning, oversampling and undersampling techniques can be used to address data bias. Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances from the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of instances from the majority class. These techniques can help balance the dataset and prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Diverse data collection is another strategy for addressing data bias. By collecting data from various sources, domains, and demographics, the dataset becomes more representative of the real-world scenario, reducing the likelihood of bias.

In conclusion, techniques such as stratified sampling, control areas, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be employed to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, the specific choice of technique will depend on the dataset and the problem at hand.
