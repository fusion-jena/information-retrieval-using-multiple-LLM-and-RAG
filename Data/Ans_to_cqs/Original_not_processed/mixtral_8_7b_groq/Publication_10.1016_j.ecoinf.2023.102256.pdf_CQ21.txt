Based on the provided context, there are no specific details mentioned about post-processing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, it does mention that the model's output is reduced to only the species involved in the study after the training phase.

After training the model, the output probabilities for all 8,836 species are obtained. Then, the model keeps only the 22 species involved in the study and multiplies their outputs with the corresponding outputs of the baseline model. This suggests a form of post-processing where the model focuses on the species of interest.

However, the context does not explicitly mention any evaluation metrics, confusion matrices, or saliency maps. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are commonly used to assess the performance of a model. Confusion matrices provide a summary of prediction results on a classification problem. Saliency maps highlight the important features that the model uses for making a particular prediction.

In conclusion, while the context provides insights into the architecture and training of the model, it does not explicitly mention any post-processing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.
