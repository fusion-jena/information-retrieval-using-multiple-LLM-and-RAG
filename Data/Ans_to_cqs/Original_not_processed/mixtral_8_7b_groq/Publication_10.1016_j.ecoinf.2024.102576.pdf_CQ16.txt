The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the deep learning model in the land-cover classification process. However, it does mention that the model is trained based on the results of previous steps and that the training data is divided into a mask for training data and a mask for validation data.

It is common in deep learning training to use a validation set to evaluate the performance of the model during training and to determine when training should be stopped. One common criterion for determining when training is complete is when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model is starting to overfit to the training data. This is known as early stopping.

Additionally, the learning rate of the model can be adjusted during training using techniques such as learning rate schedules or learning rate decay. These techniques can help the model converge to a optimal solution and prevent overshooting the minimum.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the deep learning model in the land-cover classification process, it is common to use a validation set and early stopping, as well as learning rate schedules or decay, to prevent overfitting and help the model converge to a optimal solution.
