Answer:::

The data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the text is images. The study involved downloading 7362 images and labeling them as "dam" or "not dam." These images were used to train a classification model using a deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The authors utilized transfer learning by initializing an ImageNet pre-trained ResNet34 model. The images were augmented using data augmentation techniques such as vertical flipping, limiting over-exposure, and disabling zooming. The model was trained using a batch size of 300 images for ten epochs.

Additionally, the study used the same image data to calculate the probability of false positives by analyzing and validating approximately 2000 dams in each state and territory. The authors used the deep learning CNN to analyze and validate the dams and calculate the probability of false positives.

Therefore, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images. Other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV are not mentioned in the text.
