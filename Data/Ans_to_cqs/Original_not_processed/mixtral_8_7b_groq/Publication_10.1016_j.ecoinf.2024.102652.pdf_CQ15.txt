Answer:::

The optimization technique applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context is the Adam optimizer. The Adam optimizer is a type of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method that is commonly used in machine learning and deep learning. It is an extension of the standard SGD algorithm that includes adaptive moment estimation, which allows for per-parameter learning rates. This can result in faster and more efficient training of deep learning models. The Adam optimizer was selected for this pipeline because it takes into account the moving averages of both the gradient and the squared gradient, which can lead to better convergence and generalization performance. The learning rate used in this pipeline varies based on the cosine function's law and is often in the range between 0.0 and 1.0. The batch size used in this pipeline is 32, which was chosen as a balance between memory limitations and making full use of computer resources. The learning process is halted if there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs using an early stopping function. The loss function used in this pipeline is the cross-entropy loss function, which is a common choice for classification problems.
