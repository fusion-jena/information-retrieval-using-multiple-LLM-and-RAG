Answer:::

The generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through the careful design of the data splitting process. To prevent overfitting and poor generalization of the model, the authors kept the integrity of events during data splitting. This means that all images of a capture event, where the camera captures multiple images in succession, were put into the same dataset. This approach prevents the model from learning specific patterns within an event that may not generalize well to new data.

Moreover, for the SS and LSM camera trap image datasets, the data was split so that images from the same event were in the same dataset. This approach prevented the model from learning specific patterns within an event that may not generalize well to new data.

However, the text does not explicitly mention the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the model. Therefore, it can be inferred that these techniques were not used in this particular study.
