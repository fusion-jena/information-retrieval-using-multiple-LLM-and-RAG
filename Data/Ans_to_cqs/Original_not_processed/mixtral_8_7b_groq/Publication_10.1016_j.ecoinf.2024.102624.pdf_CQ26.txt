The provided context discusses various techniques used to improve the classification accuracy of machine learning models in the context of land cover classification. However, it does not explicitly mention the strategies for addressing data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the given context.

Nevertheless, I can discuss some common techniques used to address data bias in machine learning and deep learning preprocessing:

1. **Stratified sampling**: Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures each stratum (a subset of the population sharing similar characteristics) is proportionally represented in the sample. This technique can help maintain balance in the presence of class imbalance and reduce bias in the training data.

2. **Oversampling and undersampling**: Oversampling is a technique that increases the frequency of the minority class in the training data, while undersampling reduces the frequency of the majority class. These techniques can help balance the class distribution and reduce bias. Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is a popular oversampling method that creates new instances of the minority class based on existing instances.

3. **Diverse data collection**: Collecting diverse data from various sources can help reduce bias by ensuring that the training data is representative of the entire population. This technique can help prevent overfitting and improve the generalization capabilities of the model.

4. **Data augmentation**: Data augmentation is a technique that artificially increases the size of the training dataset by applying transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping) to the existing data. This technique can help improve the model's robustness and reduce bias by providing more varied training data.

5. **Regularization techniques**: Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, can help reduce overfitting and bias by penalizing complex models. These techniques can help ensure that the model does not rely too heavily on specific features or classes, reducing the risk of bias.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques for addressing data bias during deep learning pipeline preprocessing, several common techniques can be employed, such as stratified sampling, oversampling and undersampling, diverse data collection, data augmentation, and regularization techniques.
