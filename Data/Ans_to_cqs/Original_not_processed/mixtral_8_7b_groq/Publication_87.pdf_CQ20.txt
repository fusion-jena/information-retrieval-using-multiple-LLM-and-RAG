Answer:::

The text does not explicitly mention the use of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) to significantly speed up the training process. Specifically, it is stated that training the model with a resnet50 architecture on a dataset with pictures took 75 minutes per epoch on a Mac with a 2.4Ghz processor and 64Go memory, but less than half an hour on a machine with GPU. This suggests that a GPU was used to train the model, leading to a reduction in training time by around half. Therefore, we can infer that a GPU was used as a hardware resource for training the deep learning model.
