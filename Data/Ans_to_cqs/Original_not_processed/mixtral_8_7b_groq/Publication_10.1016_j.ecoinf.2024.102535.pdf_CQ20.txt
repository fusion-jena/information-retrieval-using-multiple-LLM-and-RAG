Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. The text focuses on the architecture details of the classifiers, modifications made to improve their performance, and potential directions for future research. It includes descriptions of the feature extractor modules based on VGG, ResNet, and Xception architectures, as well as the classifier module architecture. However, it does not mention any details about the hardware used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional context.
