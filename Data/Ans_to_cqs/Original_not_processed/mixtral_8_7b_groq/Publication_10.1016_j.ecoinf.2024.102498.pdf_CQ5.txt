The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the described pipelines. Instead, it discusses the application of deep learning techniques to Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification tasks using satellite imagery.

In the study by Ganjirad and Bagheri (Ecological Informatics 80(2024)10249824), they propose a deep learning fusion network based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for LULC classification. However, the specific dataset used in this study is not specified.

Zhu et al. (2020) introduced So2Sat LCZ42, a benchmark dataset for global local climate zone classification. While not a standard deep learning dataset, it is a valuable resource for training and evaluating deep learning models for LULC classification.

Zhu et al. (2021) mapped abandoned farmland in China using time series MODIS NDVI data. This study demonstrates the use of satellite imagery for LULC classification, but it does not mention the use of standard deep learning datasets.

The study by Zhang et al. (2017) focused on image classification using RapidEye data, integrating spectral and textual features in a random forest classifier. Although not directly related to deep learning, this study highlights the importance of incorporating various features for accurate LULC classification.

In summary, the provided context discusses the use of satellite imagery for LULC classification tasks and introduces a benchmark dataset (So2Sat LCZ42) for this purpose. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
