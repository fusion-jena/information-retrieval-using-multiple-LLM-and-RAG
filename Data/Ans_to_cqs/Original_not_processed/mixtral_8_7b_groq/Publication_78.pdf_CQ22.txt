Answer:::
The performance of the deep learning models in the given study is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity (also known as recall), specificity, F1-score, and Cohen's Kappa.

Accuracy is the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of instances. Sensitivity, also known as recall, is the ratio of accurate predictions of bleached corals to the total number of actual bleached corals. Specificity is the ratio of accurate predictions of unbleached corals to the total number of actual unbleached corals. The F1-score is the weighted mean of sensitivity and specificity. Cohen's Kappa (Îº) measures the agreement between the predicted and actual values, taking into account the possibility of chance agreement.

These metrics are calculated using the confusion matrix, which is a table that summarizes the predictions made by the model. The confusion matrix includes true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). TP represents the number of instances for which the model correctly predicted the positive class, while TN represents the number of instances for which the model correctly predicted the negative class. FP represents the number of instances for which the model incorrectly predicted the positive class, while FN represents the number of instances for which the model incorrectly predicted the negative class.

Sensitivity is calculated as the ratio of TP to the sum of TP and FN, while specificity is calculated as the ratio of TN to the sum of TN and FP. Accuracy is calculated as the ratio of the sum of TP and TN to the sum of TP, TN, FP, and FN. The F1-score is calculated as the harmonic mean of sensitivity and specificity, while Cohen's Kappa is calculated using the formula provided in the context.

In the study, these metrics are used to compare the performance of different deep learning models, including AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, GoogleNet, and Inceptionv3, as well as hand-crafted descriptors such as LBP, HOG, LETRIST, GLCM, CJLBP, and LTrP. The comparison is made for three different datasets, and the results are presented in Tables 2 and 4 and Figure 10. The confusion matrices for binary and multi-class datasets are also presented in Figure 11.

In summary, the performance of deep learning models for coral reef image classification is evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and Cohen's Kappa, which are calculated using the confusion matrix. These metrics are used to compare the performance of different deep learning models and hand-crafted descriptors for three different datasets.
