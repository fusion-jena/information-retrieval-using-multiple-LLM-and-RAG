The provided context does not contain information about the data preprocessing techniques used to address data bias. However, it does discuss the use of a novel ensemble method called sBal_IH for classification in imbalanced datasets (Chongomweru & Kasem, 2021).

In terms of data bias in deep learning, it is crucial to address this issue during the preprocessing stage. Some common techniques to tackle data bias include:

1. Stratified sampling: This method involves dividing the dataset into strata based on the class distribution and then ensuring that each stratum is proportionally represented in both the training and testing sets. This helps maintain the balance between classes in the dataset.
2. Oversampling: In oversampling, instances from the minority class are replicated to balance the class distribution. However, this may lead to overfitting, as the model may learn to recognize the replicated instances instead of generalizing the patterns.
3. Undersampling: Undersampling involves reducing the number of instances from the majority class to balance the class distribution. This method may lead to loss of valuable information from the majority class.
4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the target population can help reduce data bias.

While the provided context does not discuss these preprocessing techniques, it does mention the use of Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning (Khan et al., 2020). This technique can help improve the model's performance by finding the optimal hyperparameters for the given dataset.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not contain information about the data preprocessing techniques used to address data bias, it is crucial to consider these methods during the preprocessing stage of the deep learning pipeline.
