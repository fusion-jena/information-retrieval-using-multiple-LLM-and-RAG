Answer:::

The hyperparameters of the model were optimized using Bayesian optimization, as described in the context. This method focuses on minimizing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions based on environmental cross-validation with ten folds. The optimization was carried out using the R package "mlr3mbo."

The search space of optimal hyperparameters was defined by the ranges of "mtry" (number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split), "min.node.size" (minimum size of terminal nodes), and "num.trees" (number of trees to grow). These hyperparameters correspond to the terminology used in the R package "ranger."

It is not explicitly mentioned in the context whether other optimization methods such as grid search or random search were also used. However, it is clear that the primary method used for hyperparameter optimization was Bayesian optimization.
