Based on the provided context, there are two preprocessing steps mentioned before training a deep learning model for audio data. These steps are:

1. Repeating the signal or resizing the audio image: The duration of audio files in CLO-43DS data is different, which cannot be directly used as input to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). To handle this issue, the first method is to repeat the signal from the beginning to force a fixed duration of 2 seconds. The second method is to directly resize the audio image to a fixed size.
2. Converting audio data into a suitable format: For the feature learning part of the proposed model, a VGG style network is used, which has been previously used for classifying acoustic scenes. This network is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10âˆ’4. The categorical cross-entropy is utilized as the loss function. The batch size is 64 samples, and the network is trained with 200 epochs. The input to the CNNs can be Mel-spectrogram, harmonic-component based spectrogram, percussive-component based spectrogram, or a SubSpectralNet architecture with Mel-spectrogram as the input.

Therefore, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model for audio data include repeating the signal or resizing the audio image and converting audio data into a suitable format such as Mel-spectrogram, harmonic-component based spectrogram, or percussive-component based spectrogram.
