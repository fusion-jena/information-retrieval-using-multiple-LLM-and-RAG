The performance of the deep learning model was evaluated using various metrics, including precision, recall, and average precision (AP) at different Intersections Over Union (IoU) thresholds. These matrices were used to assess the model's performance on the validation set after 300 epochs.

Precision, often denoted as P, is a metric defined as the ratio of true positive predictions to the sum of true positive and false positive predictions. It measures the proportion of correct positive predictions made by the model.

Recall, denoted as R, is another metric defined as the ratio of true positive predictions to the sum of true positive and false negative predictions. It measures the proportion of actual positive instances that were correctly identified by the model.

Average Precision (AP) is a more comprehensive metric that considers both precision and recall. It is calculated as the area under the precision-recall curve, obtained by plotting precision values at various recall levels. Specifically, AP0.5, which indicates the average precision at 50% IoU, provides a more balanced reflection of the global detection performance of the model.

The F1 score, a harmonic mean of precision and recall, was also used to evaluate the model's performance. It combines precision and recall into a single metric that provides a balanced assessment of the model's accuracy.

In addition, the model was compared with several state-of-the-art object detection models, such as Shufflenet V2-YOLOX, Improved YOLOv5s, CA-YOLOv5, Des-YOLOv4, M2Det, Swin Transformer, YOLOv7, and EfficientDet. These models were tested on the same apple dataset to ensure a fair comparison.

Furthermore, the context describes a depth-attention mechanism used in the YOLOv5 model. However, this mechanism is not a metric used to evaluate the model's performance. Instead, it is a component of the model's architecture, designed to improve the model's accuracy by selectively focusing on relevant features in the input data.
