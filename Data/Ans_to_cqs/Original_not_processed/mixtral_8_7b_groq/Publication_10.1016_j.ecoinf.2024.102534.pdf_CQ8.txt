Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository in sources like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The sources mainly discuss topics related to geographical and ecological studies, such as digital elevation models, species richness, leaf anatomical structures, and soil information.

The context includes scientific papers, datasets, and tools for land use change analysis, but none of them mention a deep learning pipeline or its code repository.

An example of a related topic is the study by Hengl et al., 2017, which presents SoilGrids250m, a global gridded soil information dataset based on machine learning. However, there is no information about a code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this study.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information about the code repository for a deep learning pipeline.
