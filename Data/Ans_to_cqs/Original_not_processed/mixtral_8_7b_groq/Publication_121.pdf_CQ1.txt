Answer:::
The provided context does not directly discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of pre-trained models and public datasets in the context of transfer learning.

In transfer learning, deep learning models are trained on one task and then re-purposed on a similar but different task. This is often done by using a pre-trained model, which has already been trained on a large dataset, and then fine-tuning it on a smaller dataset related to the new task. The context mentions the use of pre-trained models that have been trained on 1.4 million images from 1000 classes, which were originally sourced from the ImageNet dataset. Therefore, it can be inferred that public datasets like ImageNet are one source of raw data used in the deep learning pipeline, at least in the context of transfer learning.

Additionally, the context also mentions the use of sensors in the broader context of mobile devices and plant identification. Specifically, it mentions the use of MobileNet models, which are designed to be lightweight and efficient for mobile and embedded devices. These models could potentially be used in conjunction with sensors to collect raw data for deep learning tasks related to plant identification on mobile devices.

However, the context does not provide any specific information on other methods for collecting raw data, such as surveys or other types of data collection. Therefore, a complete answer to this query would require additional information beyond what is provided in the context.
