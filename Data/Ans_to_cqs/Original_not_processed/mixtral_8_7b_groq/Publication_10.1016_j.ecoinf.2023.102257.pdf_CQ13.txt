Based on the information provided, the text does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. The focus of the text is on the experiment's results, which compare the efficiency of different data labeling methods, including a method that uses a machine learning (ML) bounding box model.

The text does provide some details about the camera trap settings and the ML model's performance metrics. For instance, the triggering speed of the camera trap was set to "fast" (0.1 seconds), and the Infrared LED flash was set to "economy." Additionally, the ML model had a sensitivity of 60 feet, with false positive and false negative predictions of 4.2% and 3.6%, respectively. However, these details do not include the specific hyperparameters used during the training of the deep learning model.

In summary, the text does not provide enough information to determine the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
