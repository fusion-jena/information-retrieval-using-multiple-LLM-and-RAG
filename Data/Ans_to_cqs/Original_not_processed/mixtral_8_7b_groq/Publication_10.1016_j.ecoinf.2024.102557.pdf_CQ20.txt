The provided context does not contain specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. While the text mentions the use of deep learning techniques in ecology and provides references to various studies, it does not give details about the computational infrastructure used in those studies.

The context does mention the use of the R package “ranger” for training random forest models, but this package can run on standard CPUs and does not necessarily require specialized hardware like GPUs or TPUs. Deep learning models, on the other hand, typically require more computational power and are often trained on GPUs or TPUs.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer this query accurately. However, it is reasonable to assume that deep learning models in ecology are trained on hardware resources similar to those used in other fields, such as GPUs or TPUs.
