Answer:::

The context does not provide detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does give some insights into the steps that might have been taken before deployment.

Firstly, the trained models were built using specific parameters and functions. These include using a batch size of 30 during training, batch normalization of input data, and using an optimized rectified linear activation function (Leaky ReLU) after convolution or concatenate layers. The learning rate and dropout rate were set to 0.001, and a bias value of 0 was used. The number of training epochs varied depending on the depth of the neural network.

The models were built using the TensorFlow (version 1.12.0) and Numpy (version 1.19.2) packages in a Python (version 3.6.2) environment packaged by Conda-forge and compiled with GCC (version4.8.2,20140120). The operation system used was CentOS Linux release 7.7.1908 (Core) with 32 CPUs, and each CPU had 64 processors.

For the AlexNet model, the study mentioned that it employed rectified linear activation (ReLU) as an activation function to speed up the training process. It also had three fully connected layers after the flatten layer to pool channel information.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the trained models were likely serialized to save the trained parameters and weights. The models were then deployed on a platform that supported the required computational resources. The choice of platform would depend on the specific requirements of the application, such as latency, throughput, and cost.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the models were likely serialized, and the choice of platform would depend on the specific requirements of the application.
