The provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning models. However, it does mention the use of an Autoencoder (AE) and an Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) model, which are both types of deep learning models.

The AE model consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder maps the input data vector x to a hidden representation h using a weight matrix W, bias vector b, and activation function σe. The decoder then maps the hidden representation h to a reconstruction vector y using a weight matrix W', bias vector b', and activation function σd. The model is trained to minimize the mean square error between the output y and the input x.

The EN-SAE model is a stacked autoencoder that uses Elastic Net regularization to improve the generalization ability of the model and reduce overfitting. Elastic Net is a linear combination of L1 and L2 regularization and provides sparse connections which can save training time.

In general, deep learning models have several hyperparameters that can be tuned to improve performance, such as learning rate, batch size, number of layers, number of units in each layer, activation function, optimizer, and regularization parameters. The learning rate controls the step size at each iteration, and the optimizer is used to update the weights and biases in the direction that minimizes the loss function. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop. Regularization parameters, such as L1 and L2, control the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning models, it is likely that these hyperparameters were tuned to optimize the performance of the models.
