Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, the study does mention that they conducted retrieval experiments where every image is used as a query image and is matched with every remaining image in the database. This approach ensures that the model is exposed to a wide variety of images, which could help improve its generalizability.

Moreover, the study compares the performance of their proposed model, SeedNet, with other deep learning models and traditional machine learning methods. This comparison provides insights into how well SeedNet performs relative to other models, which can be seen as an indirect measure of its generalizability.

SeedNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that contains six learnable layers, with five of them being convolutional layers and the last one being fully-connected. The authors applied the ReLU activation function to the output of every convolutional layer and periodically inserted a pooling layer between successive convolutional layers to reduce the number of parameters and computation in the network, thereby controlling overfitting. These techniques can also contribute to the model's generalizability.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of measures such as a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the authors did employ other techniques that could improve the model's ability to generalize, such as using retrieval experiments to expose the model to a wide variety of images and applying techniques to reduce overfitting.
