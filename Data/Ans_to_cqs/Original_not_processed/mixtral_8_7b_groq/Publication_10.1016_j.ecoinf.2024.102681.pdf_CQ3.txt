The provided context does not include specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for drought assessment and prediction. However, it does mention the use of a comprehensive dataset that includes various influencing factors and a drought propagation time series.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines depend on the specific task and data being used. For object detection and image segmentation tasks, common annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, where rectangular boxes are drawn around objects of interest, and instance segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and labeled individually.

In the context of drought assessment and prediction, data annotation techniques may include labeling drought events based on drought indices or other criteria, as well as annotating relevant environmental factors such as land use and land cover, temperature, and precipitation.

The study mentioned in the context uses a hybrid deep learning model that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) to effectively capture the intricate process of drought propagation. While the study does not explicitly mention data annotation techniques, it is likely that the dataset used in the study was pre-processed and labeled in a way that allowed for effective training and evaluation of the deep learning model.

Overall, while the provided context does not include specific information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for drought assessment and prediction, it is an important step in the deep learning process for various tasks and applications.
