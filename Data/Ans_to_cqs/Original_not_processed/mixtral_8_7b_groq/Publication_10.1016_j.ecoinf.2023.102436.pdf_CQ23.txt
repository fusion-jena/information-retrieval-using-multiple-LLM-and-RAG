Answer:::

The provided context does not contain direct information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it discusses a study that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze landscape photographs. While the text does not mention specific techniques like diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, it is possible that these or similar methods were used.

In the context of machine learning and deep learning, ensuring generalizability often involves techniques such as:

1. Diverse dataset: Using a dataset that includes a wide variety of examples to help the model learn to handle different situations and reduce overfitting.
2. Cross-validation: A technique where the dataset is split into several parts, and the model is trained and tested multiple times, each time using a different subset for testing. This helps to ensure that the model's performance is not dependent on specific subsets of the data.
3. Stratified splitting: A method of splitting the dataset that ensures each subset contains a representative proportion of the various categories or classes present in the data. This can help to ensure that the model is exposed to a balanced distribution of examples during training.

Without more information about the specific methods used in the study discussed in the context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer. However, it is reasonable to assume that some or all of these techniques were employed to help ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in the study.
