Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, as described in the provided context, involves a division of the dataset into training and validation sets. This split is applied to a curated subset of 330 videos from the GBIF database, which originally contains over 2300 videos. The subset of 330 videos is manually annotated, indicating whether or not each frame contains an animal.

For the purpose of training and validating the model, the data is split into 30 frames for training and 300 frames for validation. This specific split is used to tune the parameters of the DynAIkonTrap system and evaluate its performance. It is important to note that camera-related parameters, such as focal length, are not considered or used in these tests. Instead, a consistent focal length, equivalent to that of the RPi camera module, is assumed for all cameras in the dataset.

This data split approach does not mention a separate test set, which is typically used to evaluate the final model's performance. However, the validation set can serve a similar purpose by providing an unbiased evaluation of the model's ability to generalize from the training data.

In summary, the data split for deep learning model training in this context involves a manual annotation of a curated subset of 330 videos from the GBIF database. The data is then divided into 30 frames for training and 300 frames for validation, with the focal length of all cameras being assumed to be the same as that of the RPi camera module.
