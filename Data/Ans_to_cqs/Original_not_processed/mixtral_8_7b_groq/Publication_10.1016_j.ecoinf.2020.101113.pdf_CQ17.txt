The text describes the use of one regularization method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline: dropout.

Dropout is a regularization technique that is applied during the training of neural networks. It works by randomly dropping out, or "ignoring", a certain percentage of nodes in a layer during each training iteration. In this study, a dropout rate of 0.5 was used, meaning that each node was ignored with a 50% probability. This has the effect of training a group of different models, as a different subset of nodes is connected to the final layer at each iteration. This reduces the chance of overfitting, as it prevents the model from becoming too reliant on any one set of nodes.

The text also mentions the use of a pre-trained model, which can also help to prevent overfitting. In this study, a ResNet50 model that was pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset was used. The ImageNet dataset contains over one million photo images across 1000 classes, and models pre-trained on this dataset have been found to learn a variety of image features that can be successfully tuned to spectrogram classification. Using a pre-trained model can help to prevent overfitting by providing the model with a set of pre-determined features that it can use as a starting point, rather than having to learn all of the features from scratch.

The text does not mention the use of L2 regularization as a regularization method. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a technique that works by adding a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This has the effect of shrinking the weights towards zero, which can help to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.

In summary, the text describes the use of dropout as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. It does not mention the use of L2 regularization.
