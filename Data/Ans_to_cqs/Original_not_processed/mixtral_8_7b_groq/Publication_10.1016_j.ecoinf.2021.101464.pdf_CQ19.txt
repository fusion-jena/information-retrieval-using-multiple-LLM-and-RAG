Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the use of deep learning models, specifically about the frameworks used to build such models. The context focuses on the application of a random forest model using the R statistical software, and it describes the process and results of the model's parameter optimization.

The mentioned R packages, "RandomForest" and "rfPermute," are related to the implementation of the random forest model, not deep learning models. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model.
