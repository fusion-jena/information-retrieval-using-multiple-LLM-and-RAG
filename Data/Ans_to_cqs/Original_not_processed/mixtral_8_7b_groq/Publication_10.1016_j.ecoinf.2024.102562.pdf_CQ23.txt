Answer:::

The generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through the preparation of a diverse dataset and the use of a partially trained model to annotate new data. The dataset used to train the model was initially small and time-consuming to annotate. To prepare a larger dataset to generalize the model for the Greenland data, the model was partially trained to learn the data first and then used to annotate new data before training it further. This allowed for the creation of a larger dataset of 540 training images and 141 validation images within a day.

Additionally, a separate small dataset was used to fine-tune the model for data from Kenya, where the image quality was lower compared to the other two locations. This approach allowed the model to learn and adapt to the variations in the data from different locations.

However, the text does not explicitly mention the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the model. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance and generalizability of a model by dividing the dataset into multiple subsets and training and testing the model on each subset. Stratified splitting is a method used to divide a dataset into training and testing sets while preserving the distribution of key characteristics in each set. The use of these techniques would further enhance the generalizability of the deep learning model.
