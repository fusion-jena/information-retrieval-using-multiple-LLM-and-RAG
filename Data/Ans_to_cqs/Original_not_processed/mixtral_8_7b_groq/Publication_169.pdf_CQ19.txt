The deep learning model for plant species identification was built using the Python library Keras, with Theano as the backend. The Keras library is a high-level neural networks API, capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. In this case, Theano was used as the underlying engine for the model's computation graph.

Theano is a popular open-source Python library for highly optimized numerical computations, particularly well-suited for tasks in deep learning. It allows users to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. Theano's capabilities include automatic differentiation, speed and memory optimizations through symbolic manipulations, and the ability to run on GPUs.

The combination of Keras and Theano provides a powerful and flexible framework for building deep learning models. Keras's user-friendly interface enables rapid prototyping and experimentation, while Theano ensures efficient computation and optimization during the model's training phase.

In summary, the deep learning model for plant species identification was constructed using the Keras library with Theano as the backend. This combination of tools offers a robust and efficient framework for building and training deep learning models.
