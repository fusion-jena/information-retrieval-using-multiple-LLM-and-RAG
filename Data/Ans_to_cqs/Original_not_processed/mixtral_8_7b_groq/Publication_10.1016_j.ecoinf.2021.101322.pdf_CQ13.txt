Answer:::
The provided context discusses the use of a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for certain tasks, but it does not give specific details about the hyperparameters used, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. However, it does mention that minibatch gradient descent was used during training. The specific CNN implementation was done using Keras and TensorFlow, and pre-trained weights from EfficientNet-B4 were used for transfer learning. The context also states that the training was performed using CUDA version 9.1, CuDNN, and Nvidia P100 accelerator cards.

An additional table is presented with performance metrics for the CNN, including test loss, mean squared error (MSE), mean average percentage error (MAPE), and accuracy (Acc%). However, this table does not contain information about the hyperparameters used during training.

In summary, while the context provides information about the deep learning model's architecture, training process, and performance metrics, it does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters like learning rate or optimizer used in the model.
