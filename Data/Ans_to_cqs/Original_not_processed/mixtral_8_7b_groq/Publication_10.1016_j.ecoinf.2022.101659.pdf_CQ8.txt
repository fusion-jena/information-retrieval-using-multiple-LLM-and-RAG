Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about a code repository for a deep learning pipeline related to the study of bivalve gaping and its linkage with key metabolic functions like filtering water, feeding, and respiration. The context mainly focuses on the importance of studying bivalve gaping, the potential benefits of collecting big data on valve gaping, and the relevance of this research for aquaculture decision-making.

However, it is mentioned that combining mechanistic models with empirical laboratory experiments could be helpful in understanding the linkages between gaping activity, clearance rate, respiration rates, and energy consumption. Therefore, it is possible that a deep learning pipeline might have been developed as part of this research. Nonetheless, the context does not provide any information about the availability of such a code repository on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

In conclusion, while a deep learning pipeline might have been used in this research, there is no information available in the provided context about the location of its code repository.
