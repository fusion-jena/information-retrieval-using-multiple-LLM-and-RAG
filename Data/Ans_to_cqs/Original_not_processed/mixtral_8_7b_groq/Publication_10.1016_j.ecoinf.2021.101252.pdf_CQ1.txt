Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of time series data, which can come from various sources such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets.

For instance, in the context of ecology, time series data can be collected through surveys, such as bird counts or climate data collected over a period of time (Reside et al., 2010; Reichstein et al., 2019). Sensors can also be used to collect time series data, such as in the case of monitoring insects using optoacoustic signal processing (Potamitis et al., 2015).

Additionally, public datasets can be a valuable source of time series data for deep learning applications. For example, the arXiv paper on deep learning (2007.05558) mentions the use of publicly available datasets for training deep learning models.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give specific details on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it is mentioned that time series data can come from various sources such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets.
