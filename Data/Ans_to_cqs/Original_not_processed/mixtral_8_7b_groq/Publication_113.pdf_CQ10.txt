Answer:

The provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on describing the methodology, results, and discussion of a deep active learning system for species identification and counting in camera trap images. While it mentions the use of a pre-trained detector model, an embedding model, and an active learning procedure, there is no reference to a specific code repository or location where the pipeline's implementation can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide a code repository link based on the given context.
