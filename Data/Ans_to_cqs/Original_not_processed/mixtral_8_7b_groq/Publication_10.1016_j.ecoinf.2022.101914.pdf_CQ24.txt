Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of ensemble models and background sampling strategies in species distribution modeling, but it does not directly mention strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines such as setting a random seed value.

However, the concept of using randomness in a controlled manner is present in the context. For instance, the authors used random selections of background points from the training dataset to maintain consistency across background points used to train each model. This strategy ensures that any variation in model results is not due to variation in the response variable but rather the sampling method.

In deep learning pipelines, setting a random seed value is a common practice to ensure reproducibility and handle randomness. By setting a seed value, the random number generator used in the pipeline is initialized to a specific state, ensuring that the same sequence of random numbers is generated each time the pipeline is run. This allows for consistent results and enables researchers to compare and replicate their findings.

Therefore, while not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, the concept of handling randomness in a controlled manner is present. In deep learning pipelines, setting a random seed value is a common strategy to ensure reproducibility and consistency in model results.
