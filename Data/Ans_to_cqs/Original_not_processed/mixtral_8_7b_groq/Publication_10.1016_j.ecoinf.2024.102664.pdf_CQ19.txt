Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM models. However, it is highly likely that a popular deep learning library such as TensorFlow or PyTorch was used, as they are widely used for building and training deep learning models.

TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google Brain Team, while PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. Both libraries support building and training of deep learning models, including CNN, LSTM, and hybrid models.

Considering the popularity and extensive support for deep learning models in both TensorFlow and PyTorch, it is reasonable to assume that either of these libraries was used to build the models in the study. However, without explicit mention in the provided context, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
