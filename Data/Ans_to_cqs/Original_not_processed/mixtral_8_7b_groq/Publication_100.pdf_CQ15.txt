Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in the given context utilizes the Adam optimization technique, which is a variant of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). 

SGD is a fundamental optimization algorithm in machine learning that updates the parameters of a model based on the gradient of the loss function. However, it can be slow and inefficient, especially when dealing with large datasets. To address this, the Adam optimization technique was developed.

Adam is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of two other optimization methods: AdaGrad and RMSProp. It adaptively scales the magnitude of the parameter updates based on the statistics of previous updates to speed up convergence. This is achieved by maintaining two running averages, one for the gradient and another for the square of the gradient. These running averages help in adjusting the learning rate for each parameter individually, making it more effective than SGD.

In the provided context, the Adam optimizer is used with specific hyper-parameters β1, β2, and ε set to 0.9, 0.999, and 10−8, respectively. The learning rate is automatically reduced by a factor of 0.1 when the validation loss has not improved for 15 consecutive epochs. Additionally, weight decay is applied to control the strength of the unit Gaussian prior, with a magnitude of 10−3.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in this context uses the Adam optimization technique with specific hyper-parameters and learning rate reduction strategies to efficiently train the models.
