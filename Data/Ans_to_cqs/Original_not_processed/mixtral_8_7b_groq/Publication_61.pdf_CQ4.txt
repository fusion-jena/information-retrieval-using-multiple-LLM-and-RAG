Answer: The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline consist of resizing and normalizing the patches, as well as vertically and horizontally flipping them. Specifically, the patches are first resized to 32 Ã— 32 and normalized. Then, they are flipped vertically or horizontally with a probability of 0.5, where both flips are independent events. These techniques are used to improve the accuracy of the network and make it more robust to variations in the input data. The benefits of data augmentation include faster decrease in the training loss and higher accuracy for both the training and validation sets. The confusion matrix also shows a significant improvement in the classification of cactus images. These data augmentation techniques are empirically determined and have been shown to be effective in the context of cactus recognition in aerial images.
