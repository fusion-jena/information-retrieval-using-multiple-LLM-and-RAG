Based on the provided context, there is no information available about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository for it. The context focuses on various studies related to drought tolerance, ecological niche modeling, the Neolithic transition, and vegetation and climatic history in the Iberian Peninsula. The studies use occurrence data from the GBIF database for Quercus ilex subsp. ilex and Quercus pubescens Willd., but there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository for it. Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
