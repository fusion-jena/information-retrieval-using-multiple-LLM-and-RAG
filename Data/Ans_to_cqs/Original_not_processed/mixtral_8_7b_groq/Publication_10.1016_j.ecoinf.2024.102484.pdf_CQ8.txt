Answer:::

The provided pieces of context do not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the studies mentioned. The studies discuss the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning for monitoring ecosystem service change and assessing land degradation, but they do not mention where the code for the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide the code repository location based on the given context.
