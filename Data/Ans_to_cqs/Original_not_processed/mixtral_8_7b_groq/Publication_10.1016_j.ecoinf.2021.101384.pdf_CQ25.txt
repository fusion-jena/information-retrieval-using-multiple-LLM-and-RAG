Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of a deep learning model and its specific purpose such as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, it is mentioned that GFW distributes vessel data aggregated at 0.01 resolutions with fishing activity cells already classified through a machine learning model. It is not specified if this machine learning model is a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer regarding the purpose of a deep learning model in this context.
