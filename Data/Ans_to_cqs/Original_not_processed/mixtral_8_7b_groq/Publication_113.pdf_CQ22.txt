Answer:::

The performance of the deep learning model in the given context is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and a type of F1 score called "Precision at k" or "Precision@k."

Accuracy is the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. It gives an overall idea of how well the model is performing.

Precision, in this case, is defined as the proportion of true positive predictions (relevant images) among all positive predictions. It is calculated as the number of true positive predictions divided by the sum of true positive and false positive predictions.

Recall, also known as sensitivity, is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of relevant images. It measures the proportion of correctly identified relevant images among all relevant images.

The Precision@k metric is a type of F1 score that combines precision and recall. It measures the precision of the top k predicted relevant images. In the context provided, k ranges from 1 to 9. A higher Precision@k indicates better performance in identifying the most relevant images.

These metrics are used to assess the model's performance in object detection on the Snapshot Serengeti dataset, as shown in the confusion table. The table displays the number of true positive, false positive, and false negative predictions for different image categories. The metrics are calculated based on these values.

In summary, the deep learning model's performance is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and Precision@k metrics. These metrics help measure the model's ability to correctly identify and rank relevant images in the Snapshot Serengeti dataset.
