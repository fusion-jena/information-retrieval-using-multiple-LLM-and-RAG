Based on the provided context, there is no specific deep learning model mentioned or described. However, some of the sources discuss the use of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) techniques for land cover classification and habitat suitability modeling.

Carvalho and Gomes (2003) developed a habitat suitability model for the European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) using logistic regression and GIS data. The model aimed to identify suitable areas for restocking the rabbit population based on factors such as land cover, vegetation, and human disturbance.

Calvete et al. (2004) analyzed habitat factors related to wild rabbit conservation in an agricultural landscape using GIS and statistical methods. They identified key habitat variables such as vegetation cover, landscape heterogeneity, and human disturbance that affect rabbit populations.

Calvete et al. (2006) studied habitat factors related to wild rabbit population trends after the initial impact of rabbit hemorrhagic disease. They used GIS and statistical methods to analyze the relationship between rabbit populations and habitat variables such as vegetation cover, landscape structure, and human disturbance.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the purpose of a deep learning model in this context could be for land cover classification, habitat suitability modeling, or analyzing the relationship between habitat variables and wildlife populations. However, without more specific information on the deep learning model and its intended application, a more precise answer cannot be provided.
