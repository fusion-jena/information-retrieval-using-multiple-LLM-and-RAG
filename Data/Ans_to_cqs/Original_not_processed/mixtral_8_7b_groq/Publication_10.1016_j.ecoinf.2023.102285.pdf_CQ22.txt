Answer:::

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). These metrics are commonly used in machine learning to assess the performance of classification models.

Accuracy (ACC) measures the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions made. It is calculated as the sum of true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN) divided by the total number of predictions.

Positive predictive value (PPV) measures the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions. It is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives (FP).

Negative predictive value (NPV) measures the proportion of true negatives among all negative predictions. It is calculated as the number of true negatives divided by the sum of true negatives and false negatives (FN).

Sensitivity (Se) measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positives. It is calculated as the number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives.

Specificity (Sp) measures the proportion of true negatives among all actual negatives. It is calculated as the number of true negatives divided by the sum of true negatives and false positives.

Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) is a measure of the quality of binary classifications. It takes into account true and false positives and negatives and is generally regarded as a balanced measure that can be used even if the classes are of different sizes.

These metrics are used in the context of Tables 10 and 11, which provide detailed confusion matrices of the classifiers outlined in Table 11. The tables show the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives for each classifier, as well as the corresponding sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy.

For example, in Table 10, the first row shows the results for the UCLAN test dataset. The classifier correctly identified 140 out of 145 actual positives, resulting in a sensitivity of 0.9655. It also correctly identified 4997 out of 5000 actual negatives, resulting in a specificity of 0.9994. The corresponding accuracy, PPV, and NPV are 0.9984, 0.9790, and 0.9990, respectively.

In summary, the deep learning model's performance is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, PPV, NPV, Se, Sp, and MCC. These metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of the model's ability to classify the data accurately.
