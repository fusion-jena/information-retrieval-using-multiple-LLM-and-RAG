Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline described in the given context uses the Adam optimization technique.

Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is a popular optimization algorithm used in training machine learning models. It is an extension of the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) method, which updates the model parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. However, unlike SGD, Adam adaptively adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the estimates of the first and second moments of the gradients.

In this specific deep learning pipeline, the Adam optimizer is used with a learning rate of 10. The learning rate is an essential hyperparameter that controls the step size at each iteration of the optimization process. A learning rate that is too small may result in slow convergence, while a learning rate that is too large may cause the model to converge to a suboptimal solution or even diverge.

The choice of the Adam optimizer in this pipeline could be attributed to its ability to handle non-stationary objectives and its computational efficiency. Adam maintains an exponentially decaying average of past gradients and squared past gradients, which allows it to adapt the learning rate for each parameter individually. This can result in faster convergence and better generalization performance compared to other optimization algorithms.

It is worth noting that the deep learning pipeline also employs other techniques such as data augmentation, normalization, and transfer learning to improve the model's performance. Data augmentation is used to increase the diversity of the training data by applying random transformations such as horizontal flips, rotations, and zooming. Data normalization is used to rescale the pixel values to a range of [0, 1] and center them around the mean values of the ImageNet dataset. Transfer learning is used by initializing the model's weights with pre-trained weights from a large-scale dataset, which can help the model learn more generalizable features and reduce the amount of training data required.
