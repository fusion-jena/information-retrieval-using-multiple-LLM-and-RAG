Answer:::
The code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study "Detection and annotation of plant organs from digitised herbarium scans using deep learning" is available on GitHub. The study was conducted by Sohaib Younis and colleagues from the Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre, Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Philipps-University Marburg, Marburg, Germany.

The GitHub repository, named "Plant Organ Detection", contains the source code and materials necessary to replicate the study's results. It includes the deep learning model architecture, training and evaluation scripts, and annotated herbarium scans used for training and testing the model. The repository also provides instructions on how to set up the development environment, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

The deep learning pipeline is based on the Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network) architecture and was implemented using the Detectron2 library developed by Facebook Research. The model was trained on hundreds of herbarium scans manually annotated with thousands of bounding boxes for six types of plant organs.

The GitHub repository is publicly available and can be accessed at <https://github.com/2younis/plant-organ-detection>. Interested researchers can use the code and materials to build upon the study's findings and develop new applications for deep learning in herbarium specimen analysis.

In summary, the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study "Detection and annotation of plant organs from digitised herbarium scans using deep learning" is available on GitHub at <https://github.com/2younis/plant-organ-detection>. The repository includes the source code, annotated herbarium scans, and instructions for replicating the study's results.
