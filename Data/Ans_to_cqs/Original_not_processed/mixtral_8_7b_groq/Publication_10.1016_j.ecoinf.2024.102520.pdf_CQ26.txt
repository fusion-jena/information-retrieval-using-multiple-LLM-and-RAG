The provided context discusses image acquisition, processing, and the roles of the authors, but it does not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, some of the techniques that can be used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and Diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique that can be used to ensure that the training, validation, and test sets of a deep learning model are representative of the overall data distribution. This is done by dividing the data into strata based on the distribution of the target variable, and then randomly sampling an equal number of samples from each stratum for each set. This helps to ensure that the model is trained and evaluated on a diverse set of data, and can help to reduce bias.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques that can be used to address class imbalance in the data. Class imbalance occurs when one class has significantly more samples than another class. This can lead to bias in the model, as it may be more likely to predict the majority class. Oversampling involves randomly sampling additional samples from the minority class, while undersampling involves randomly sampling fewer samples from the majority class. This helps to balance the class distribution and can help to reduce bias.

Diverse data collection is a technique that can be used to ensure that the data used to train the model is representative of the population. This can be done by collecting data from a variety of sources, and by ensuring that the data is diverse in terms of factors such as age, gender, and location. This helps to ensure that the model is trained on a diverse set of data, and can help to reduce bias.

In summary, the provided context does not mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, but some of the techniques that can be used include Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and Diverse data collection. These techniques can help to ensure that the model is trained and evaluated on a diverse set of data, and can help to reduce bias.
