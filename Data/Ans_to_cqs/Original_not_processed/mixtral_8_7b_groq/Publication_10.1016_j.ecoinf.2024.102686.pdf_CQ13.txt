Based on the provided context, the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are the learning rate (η(t)) and the neighborhood of the output neuron Sk(t). The learning rate decreases with time, which is a common practice in many deep learning models to help the model converge to the optimal solution. The neighborhood of the output neuron Sk(t) is used in the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) network, which is a type of neural network used for unsupervised clustering. The size of the neighborhood affects the clustering results, and determining the number of categories is crucial in SOM networks.

However, the context does not provide information on other hyperparameters commonly used in deep learning models, such as the optimizer, the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, activation functions, regularization techniques, and batch size. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a complete answer to the query.

Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, as described in the given context, are the learning rate (η(t)) and the neighborhood of the output neuron Sk(t) in the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) network. The learning rate decreases with time, and the neighborhood of the output neuron affects the clustering results. However, other hyperparameters commonly used in deep learning models, such as the optimizer, the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, activation functions, regularization techniques, and batch size, are not mentioned in the given context.
