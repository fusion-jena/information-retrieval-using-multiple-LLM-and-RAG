Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific purpose of a deep learning model, as there is no information given about the use of deep learning in the text. The context focuses on the use of Species Distribution Models (SDMs) in marine conservation, specifically for the seahorse species H. guttulatus and H. hippocampus. SDMs are a type of machine learning model used to predict the distribution of species based on environmental data. However, deep learning models are a different type of machine learning algorithm, which are typically used for tasks such as image classification, segmentation, or object detection. Therefore, without additional information, it is not possible to answer this query.
