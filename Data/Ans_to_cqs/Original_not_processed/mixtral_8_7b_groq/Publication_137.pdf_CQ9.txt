Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context includes a detailed explanation of the SPG (Superpoint Graph) framework, which is a deep learning pipeline for point cloud data. However, it does not mention where the data or code for this pipeline can be found.

The context includes references to several papers that may contain more information about the pipeline and the data used in its development. These papers include "Deep learning-based tree classification using mobile LiDAR data" by Guan et al. (2015), "PCPNET: Learning local shape properties from raw point clouds" by Guerrero et al. (2017), "Weakly supervised segmentation-aided classification of urban scenes from 3D lidar point clouds" by Guinard and Landrieu (2017), and "Semantic3d.net: A new large-scale point cloud classification benchmark" by Hackel et al. (2017). It is possible that the data repository is mentioned in one of these papers or in related publications.

In addition, the context includes information about the training and testing of a deep neural network for point cloud classification. However, it does not provide any details about the specific data used for training or testing.

Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to the query as the information is not available in the given context. It is recommended to check the papers and resources mentioned in the context for more information about the data repository.
