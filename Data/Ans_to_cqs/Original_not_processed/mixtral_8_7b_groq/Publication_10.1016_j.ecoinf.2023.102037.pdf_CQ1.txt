Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines. However, it does mention the use of two different datasets for training and testing deep learning models for pest classification.

The first dataset, "Pest24," was collected using an automatic imaging trap and contained 25,378 annotated images from 24 pest species (Wang et al., 2020a, 2020b, 2020c). The second dataset was used for monitoring the black pine bast scale and was collected using multiple wireless imaging devices installed in greenhouses (Hong et al., 2021).

Therefore, it can be inferred that sensors, specifically imaging sensors, were used for collecting raw data in these deep learning pipelines. Additionally, the context suggests that public datasets may not have been used in these specific studies, as there is no mention of using publicly available data.

Another possible method for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines is through surveys. Surveys can be used to collect data in the form of images, audio, or text, which can then be used to train deep learning models. However, the provided context does not mention the use of surveys for data collection.

In summary, while the provided context does not give a comprehensive answer to the query, it can be inferred that sensors, specifically imaging sensors, were used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipelines for pest classification. Additionally, the context suggests that public datasets may not have been used, and there is no mention of using surveys for data collection.
