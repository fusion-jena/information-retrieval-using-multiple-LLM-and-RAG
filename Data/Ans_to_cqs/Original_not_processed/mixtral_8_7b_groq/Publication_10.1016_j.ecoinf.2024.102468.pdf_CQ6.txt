The provided context discusses the use of Whale Tailed Hidden Markov Models (WT-HMM) for classifying blue whale vocalizations and noise signals. While it does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps for a deep learning model, it does describe some preprocessing techniques applied to the data before training the WT-HMM.

Answer:::
Before training the WT-HMM, the data undergoes specific preprocessing steps. First, feature vectors are extracted from the raw dataset. However, the context does not provide information on how these feature vectors are extracted. After extracting the feature vectors, Gaussian parameters are trained using the WT-HMM on different dataset sizes. These trained Gaussian parameters are then used to update the feature vectors from the test datasets, refining them for the classification process.

In this particular case, the preprocessing steps include feature extraction and updating the feature vectors using the trained Gaussian parameters. Although these steps are specific to the WT-HMM model, some common preprocessing techniques for deep learning models, such as normalization and scaling, might have been applied before extracting the feature vectors. The context does not provide information on data cleaning, so it is unclear if any data cleaning processes were involved.

In summary, based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps for the WT-HMM model include feature extraction and updating feature vectors using trained Gaussian parameters. However, the context does not provide enough information to determine if common deep learning preprocessing techniques like normalization, scaling, or data cleaning were applied before extracting the feature vectors.
