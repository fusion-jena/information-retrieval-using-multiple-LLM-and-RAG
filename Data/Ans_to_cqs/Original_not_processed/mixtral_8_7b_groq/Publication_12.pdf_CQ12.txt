Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is specified in the context when it mentions that the model, called BatNet, has 22 convolutional layers. CNNs are a popular choice for image classification tasks due to their ability to effectively learn spatial hierarchies of features. The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, which is also mentioned, is commonly used in CNNs for non-linear classification.
