Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of machine learning methods such as Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) in a pipeline that also includes the sigmoid activation function, the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, and the Python libraries TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. However, it does not specify which datasets were used to train and test the models.

Commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, CIFAR for image classification, and ImageNet for large-scale object recognition. However, without further information from the context, it is not possible to determine which of these or other datasets were used in the pipeline described.
