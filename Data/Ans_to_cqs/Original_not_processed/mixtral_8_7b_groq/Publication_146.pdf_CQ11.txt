Answer:::

 The provided pieces of context do not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions that a new data set was created for the project due to a lack of existing quality data, but it does not specify where this data set is stored or how it can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the data repository.
