Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, the research title "Deep learning for automated fish grading" suggests that the model is likely used for classification purposes. This assumption is further supported by the context mentioning the application of organoleptic parameters to seven fish species for automatically classifying fish freshness.

In the process, the researchers determine the most suitable number of clusters from the previous stage, which becomes the standard for the proposed number of freshness classes. Each species then attains several freshness classes based on its freshness stronghold. The clustering method is used to group the data and automatically determine the freshness class based on the dataset. This step indicates that the deep learning model is employed to partition data into clusters, where similar data (freshness parameters) are grouped together, and dissimilar data are separated into other clusters.

Although the text does not explicitly mention the deep learning model's architecture or training process, the overall context implies that the model is used for classification tasks, specifically for classifying fish freshness based on organoleptic parameters. Nonetheless, a more detailed description of the deep learning model or its specific application would provide clearer insight into its exact purpose.
