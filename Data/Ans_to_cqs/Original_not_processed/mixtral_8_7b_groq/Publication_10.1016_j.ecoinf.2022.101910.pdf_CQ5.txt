The provided context does not give specific information about the datasets used in the BirdNET deep learning pipeline for bird vocalization detection and classification. However, it does mention that BirdNET is a deep neural network developed by The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and the Chemnitz University of Technology.

In general, deep learning models for computer vision tasks often use datasets such as MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) for handwritten digit recognition, CIFAR (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research) for image classification, and ImageNet for large-scale object recognition. However, for audio-based tasks like bird vocalization detection, different datasets are used.

In the context of BirdNET, the system is trained on over 3000 bird species, and its performance has been evaluated on various bird species using recordings from the Xeno-canto database and the Macaulay library of sounds. For example, Cole et al. (2022) evaluated BirdNET for detecting 13 bird species in North America, and Tolkova et al. (2021) tested it on three common bird species.

In summary, while the specific datasets used in the BirdNET deep learning pipeline are not mentioned in the provided context, it is clear that the system is trained on a large number of bird species using recordings from various sources.
