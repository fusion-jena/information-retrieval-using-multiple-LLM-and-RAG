Answer:

The provided context discusses various applications and methods related to deep learning in remote sensing and image processing but does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general techniques that are commonly used to address data bias, which include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain characteristics (strata) and then ensuring that each subgroup is proportionally represented in both the training and validation sets. This method is useful when the dataset is imbalanced or contains class-specific bias.

2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances from the minority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by randomly duplicating instances from the minority class or by using techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) that creates new instances based on the feature space similarities between existing instances.

3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances from the majority class to balance the dataset. This can be done randomly or by using techniques like NearMiss that selects instances from the majority class based on their proximity to the minority class.

4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from various sources, perspectives, and conditions to ensure that the dataset is representative of the real-world scenarios. This method helps in reducing the bias that might be present in a single data source.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, the general techniques that can be used include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These techniques help ensure that the dataset is balanced, representative, and free from bias, which ultimately leads to better deep learning model performance.
