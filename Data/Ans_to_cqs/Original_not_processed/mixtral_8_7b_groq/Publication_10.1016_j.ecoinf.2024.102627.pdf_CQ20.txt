The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions a deep learning framework, but does not specify which one was used, and different frameworks can have different default or recommended hardware. The focus of the text is on the model architecture, predictors, and training procedure, rather than the computational resources used. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query without additional information.
