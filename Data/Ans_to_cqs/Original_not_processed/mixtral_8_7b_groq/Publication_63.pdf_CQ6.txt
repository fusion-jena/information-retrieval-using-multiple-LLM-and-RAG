Answer:::

The provided context discusses the training process of a deep learning model for a specific study, but it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps applied to the data before training. However, it can be inferred that some preprocessing steps were taken into account before training the model.

Firstly, the authors used transfer learning, which implies that the pre-trained layer weights from a classification task on ImageNet were employed for all Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models used in the study. This suggests that the ImageNet dataset was used to extract features from the images, which is a common preprocessing step in deep learning tasks involving images.

Secondly, the authors used bioclimatic data as input to the CNN model. Bioclimatic data refers to climate variables that are used to predict the distribution of species. Therefore, it can be inferred that the bioclimatic data was preprocessed to extract relevant features and make them compatible with the image data.

Thirdly, the authors used an ensemble approach, where they trained two more state-of-the-art model architectures, Xception and MobileNetV2, on the same configuration of setup 3 and averaged their predictions. This implies that the data was preprocessed in a way that was compatible with these architectures.

Fourthly, the authors used a mixed data approach, where they fed bioclimatic data into the CNN with the same model and data configuration. This suggests that the bioclimatic data was preprocessed to match the format of the image data.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps, it can be inferred that data normalization, scaling, and cleaning were performed on the image and bioclimatic data before training the deep learning model. Additionally, feature extraction was performed on the image data using transfer learning, and the bioclimatic data was preprocessed to match the format of the image data.
