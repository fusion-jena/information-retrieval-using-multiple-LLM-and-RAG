Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the methods and processes used in developing a deep learning model for bird species classification, but it does not mention where the data used in the pipeline is stored or hosted. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. For more information about the data used in this study, it would be necessary to consult the original authors or the full text of the publication.
