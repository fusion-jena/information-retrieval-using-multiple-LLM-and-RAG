The provided context does not give specific information about the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It mentions that the research uses deep learning techniques, which is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on learning methods based on structures that resemble the brain's characteristics. Deep learning includes various types of models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers. However, the text does not specify which one is used in this particular case. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given context.
