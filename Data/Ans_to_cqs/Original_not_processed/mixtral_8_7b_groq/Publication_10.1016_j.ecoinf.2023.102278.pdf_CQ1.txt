Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for entomological applications. However, it mentions that deep-learning methods are used for classification and require large training datasets. The training data used in this study is referred to as the TLm dataset, but there is no information provided about how this dataset was created or what methods were used to collect the raw data.

In general, there are various methods that can be used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines, including surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Surveys can be conducted to collect images or other data about insects or other subjects of interest. Sensors, such as cameras or other monitoring devices, can be used to collect data automatically in real-time or over extended periods. Public datasets, such as those available through organizations like ImageNet or COCO, can also be used as a source of training data for deep learning models.

In the context of entomology and pest management, it is likely that a combination of these methods is used to collect raw data for deep learning pipelines. For example, surveys could be conducted to collect images of insects in specific locations or under specific conditions. Sensors could be used to monitor insect populations over time and collect data on their behavior or other relevant factors. Public datasets could also be used to supplement these sources of data and provide a more diverse range of examples for training deep learning models.

Overall, while the provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for entomological applications, it is likely that a combination of surveys, sensors, and public datasets are used to create the training datasets required for deep learning models in this field.
