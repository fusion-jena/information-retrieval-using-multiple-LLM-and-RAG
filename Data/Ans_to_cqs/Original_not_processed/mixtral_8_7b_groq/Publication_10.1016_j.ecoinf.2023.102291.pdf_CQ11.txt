Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context includes references to several papers and articles, as well as information about different aspects of a study related to the detection of humpback whale songs using deep learning techniques. However, there is no mention of a data repository link or any information about where the data used in the study can be found. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
