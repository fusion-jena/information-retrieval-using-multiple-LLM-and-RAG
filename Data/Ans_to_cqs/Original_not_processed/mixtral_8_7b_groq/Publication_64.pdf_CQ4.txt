Answer:::

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include shearing, translation, and mirroring. However, rotation and upside-down mirroring are not applied to images tagged as 'habit' because it does not make sense to have a tree or a landscape upside down.

During training, standard data augmentation techniques are applied to the images so that the network never sees the same image. These techniques help increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's ability to generalize to new images.

The specific techniques used include shearing, which involves skewing the image along the x or y axis, and translation, which involves shifting the image horizontally or vertically. Mirroring involves flipping the image horizontally, creating a mirror image.

As for rotation and upside-down mirroring, these techniques are not applied to images tagged as 'habit'. This suggests that the dataset includes images with the 'habit' tag, which likely includes images of trees or landscapes. By excluding rotation and upside-down mirroring for these images, the researchers ensure that the orientation of the images remains consistent with their real-world orientation.

It's worth noting that the data augmentation techniques used in this study are relatively simple compared to those used in some other deep learning pipelines. More advanced techniques, such as random erasing, cutout, and mixup, have been shown to further improve model performance in some cases. However, the specific choice of data augmentation techniques depends on the nature of the dataset and the goals of the study.
