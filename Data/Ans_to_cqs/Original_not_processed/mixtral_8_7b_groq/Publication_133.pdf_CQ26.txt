Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models in insect ecoinformatics, including model training techniques, but it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. However, it is possible to infer some relevant methods based on general knowledge of deep learning practices.

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain characteristics (strata) and then ensuring that each stratum is proportionally represented in both the training and validation sets. This can help maintain the diversity of the dataset and prevent bias during model training.

2. Oversampling: In cases where certain classes are underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from these classes. This can help balance the dataset and reduce bias during model training.

3. Undersampling: Alternatively, if certain classes are overrepresented in the dataset, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of instances from these classes. This can also help balance the dataset and reduce bias during model training.

4. Diverse data collection: To minimize bias in the dataset, it is essential to collect data from various sources and ensure that the data is representative of the target population. This includes considering factors such as geographical location, time periods, and data collection methods.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques, they are common practices in deep learning to address data bias during preprocessing.
