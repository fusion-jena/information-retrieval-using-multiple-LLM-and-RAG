The provided context does not give information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The text focuses on the use of species distribution models (SDMs) and techniques to improve their performance by addressing issues such as sampling bias.

The authors mention four approaches for transforming model input data, but these are not deep learning models. Instead, these approaches aim to modify the distribution of presence sites or background sites in either geographical or environmental feature space.

The study by Wisz et al. (2008) discussed in the context primarily focuses on the effects of sample size on the performance of species distribution models. It does not mention the use of any deep learning models like CNN, RNN, or Transformer.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
