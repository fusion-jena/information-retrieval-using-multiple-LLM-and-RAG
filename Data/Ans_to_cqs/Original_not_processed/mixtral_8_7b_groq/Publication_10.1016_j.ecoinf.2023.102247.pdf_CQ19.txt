Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the use of deep learning models or the frameworks used to build them. The models that were used in the study are an ensemble of four different models, including one regression-based model and three machine-learning models (MaxEnt, RF, and SVM). These models were implemented using the BIOMOD2 package in R. However, there is no mention of deep learning models or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
