The deep learning pipeline in the given context uses image data format. The models are trained and tested on image datasets. Specifically, the training dataset consists of plant images available in PlantNet, which has around 250K images belonging to more than 6K plant species. These images are labeled by experts and come with tags specifying the focus of the image. The test datasets include Google Image Search, Portuguese Flora, and iNaturalist, which contain images retrieved from the Google Image Search engine and images from the Portuguese flora dataset. The images in these datasets belong to various species present in the training dataset. There is no mention of using audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
