The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The sources mention various databases used for obtaining biodiversity data, such as Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS), INaturalist, AquaMaps, and literature sources like Zhang and Vincent (2018). However, these databases are used for obtaining biodiversity data related to seahorses, not for the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.

Additionally, the context includes references to data availability sections and supplementary materials, but these do not specify a particular repository for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
