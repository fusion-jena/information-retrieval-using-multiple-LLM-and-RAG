Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in the given context involves the use of different data formats, primarily related to image data.

1. Static images and living videos of a commercial orchard (DN-3, DN-4)
2. RGB-images and point cloud data of a commercial orchard (DN-3)
3. RGB-images of a single tree branch (DN-3)
4. RGB-images of urban streets (DN-5)
5. Synthetic images and natural images of forests (DN-5)
6. RGB-images of a modern apple orchard (U-Net)
7. RGB-images of complex urban scenes (Cascade Mask R-CNN)

Additionally, there is a mention of training a model using binary cross-entropy loss function, which typically involves label data in the form of a CSV or some other tabular format. However, the primary focus of the provided context is on image data.
