Answer:::
The text does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework was used to build the model. However, it does mention the use of the YAMNet model, which is a pre-trained model from the TensorFlow library. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that TensorFlow was used as the deep learning framework in this case.
