Answer:::

The input data used in the deep learning pipeline described in the paper are 40-dimensional data. However, the paper does not provide specific details about the format of these data. Based on the given context, it can be inferred that these data could be in a structured format such as a CSV file, where each row represents a grid unit and each column represents a feature. The features mentioned include the LU type, soil, topography, elevation, slope, aspect, distance to settlements, distance to roads, distance to rivers, and the 4 neighborhood grid units. Therefore, the input data is likely to be a tabular format with numerical and categorical variables.

The paper also mentions the use of probability maps, which could be in the form of raster images, where each pixel value represents the probability of a certain land use type. However, the paper does not explicitly mention the format of these probability maps.

In summary, the input data used in the deep learning pipeline described in the paper are likely to be in a structured format such as a CSV file, while the probability maps could be in the form of raster images. However, the paper does not provide specific details about the data formats.
