Based on the provided context, there is no information available about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository for such a pipeline. The context focuses on the study of fire risk mapping in the MuÄŸla RDF (Remote Development Forest) in Turkey, using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices. The methodology for fire risk mapping is discussed, along with the validation of fire risk maps. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository for it. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
