Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on a research framework for analyzing vegetation changes in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River (MRB) using kNDVI (kernel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) trends and geographical detectors.

The data sources include the MOD13A2 dataset from the GEE platform, which offers NDVI data with a spatial resolution of 1 km and a temporal resolution of 16 days. The preprocessing steps for this dataset are mentioned, but data augmentation techniques are not discussed.

In the study, the researchers focus on kNDVI trends, classifications, and driver analysis. They use the Optimal Parameter-based Geographical Detector (OPGD) method, which involves discretizing continuous data into different breakpoints. Five discretization methods are considered, including standard deviation, natural breaks, equal interval, quantile, and geometric interval. However, data augmentation techniques are not mentioned in this context.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer to the query about data augmentation techniques in the deep learning pipeline.
