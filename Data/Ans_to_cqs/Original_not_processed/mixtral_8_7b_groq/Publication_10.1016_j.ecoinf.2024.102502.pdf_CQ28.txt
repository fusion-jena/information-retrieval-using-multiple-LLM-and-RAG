Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention which cloud platform was used to deploy a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a platform for remote sensing big data applications and processing environmental data. It is also noted that GEE has witnessed a significant increase in the availability of environmental data relevant to ecological processes, agriculture, forestry, and livestock biomass consumption. While GEE is primarily a geospatial analysis platform, it does offer integration with Google Cloud for more computationally intensive tasks, including machine learning and deep learning model deployment. Therefore, it is possible that a deep learning model was deployed using Google Cloud Platform, in conjunction with Google Earth Engine. However, this information is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
