Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Long Short-Term Memory combined with Convolutional Neural Networks (LSTM-CNN) model. This model is employed for determining the sentiment index in a comparative analysis of various models, including Rostcm 6.0, Simple Bayesian Networks, LSTM, and CNN. The LSTM-CNN model outperformed the other models in sentiment task analysis. This model takes advantage of the long-term memory capability of LSTM and the local feature extraction capability of CNN to process text data, enhancing model performance. However, it is important to note that the LSTM-CNN model is specifically used for sentiment analysis in the provided context, while HRNet is used for image processing tasks such as semantic segmentation.
