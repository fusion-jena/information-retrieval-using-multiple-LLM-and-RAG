Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. The text focuses on the process of data filtering and temporal/spatial scaling of environmental data for ecological processes.

However, it is important to note that when implementing a deep learning model, several hyperparameters need to be defined, such as the learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, and the number of epochs. The learning rate controls how much the weights in the model are adjusted with respect to the loss gradient, the optimizer is the method used to update the weights, and the number of layers and neurons determine the complexity of the model. The batch size is the number of samples used to compute the gradient of the loss function, and the number of epochs is the total number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific hyperparameters for a deep learning model, it is essential to define these parameters when implementing such a model. The learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, and the number of epochs are all crucial hyperparameters that need to be set for a deep learning model to function properly.
