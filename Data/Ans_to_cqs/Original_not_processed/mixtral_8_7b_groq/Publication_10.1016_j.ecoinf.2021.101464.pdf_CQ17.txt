The provided context does not directly discuss the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does describe how the Random Forest (RF) model was used to prevent overfitting when analyzing the influence of environmental factors on NAI (Negative Air Ions) concentration.

To prevent overfitting in the RF model, the number of trees (Nt) was set to 200, based on the observation that the model error tended to be stable after Nt reached 200 (Figure 1b). Additionally, the optimal number of input variables (M) was determined by minimizing the model error. It was found that the model error reached the minimum when M was 7 (Figure 1a).

While these methods are specific to the RF model and not directly related to deep learning pipelines, they do illustrate the general principle of using regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. In the context of deep learning, dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used methods for preventing overfitting. Dropout involves randomly setting a fraction of the hidden units to zero during training, which helps to prevent co-adaptation of feature detectors. L2 regularization, on the other hand, involves adding a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the norm of the model weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which can help to prevent overfitting.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, it does illustrate the general principle of using regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. In the context of deep learning, dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used methods for preventing overfitting.
