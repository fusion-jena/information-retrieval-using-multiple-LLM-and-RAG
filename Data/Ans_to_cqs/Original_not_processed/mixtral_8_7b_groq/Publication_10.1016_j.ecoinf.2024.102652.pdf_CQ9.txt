The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It is not mentioned where the data used in the study is available or if it has been shared in a data repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context focuses on the training process of the artificial neural network and the loss function used, but it does not include any details about data sharing or availability. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
