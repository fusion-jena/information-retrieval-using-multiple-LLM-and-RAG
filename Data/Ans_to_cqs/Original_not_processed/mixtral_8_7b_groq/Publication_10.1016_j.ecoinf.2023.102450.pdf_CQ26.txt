Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of "Data curation" as a contribution to the research, which can include activities such as cleaning, reformatting, and restructuring data to make it more suitable for use in machine learning models. This process can help to reduce bias by ensuring that the data is accurate, relevant, and representative of the target population.

Additionally, the CRediT authorship contribution statement mentions "Methodology" as a contribution, which can include the design of the data collection process. Diverse data collection can help to reduce bias by ensuring that the data used to train the model is representative of the target population.

The context also mentions that "Data will be made available on request", which can help other researchers to replicate the study and validate the results, which can also help to reduce bias.

In the references, there are papers that use techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling to address data bias. For example, the paper "Robust object tracking with online multiple instance learning" by Babenko et al. uses oversampling and undersampling to balance the number of positive and negative examples in the training data.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it does mention contributions such as data curation, methodology, and data availability that can help to reduce bias. Additionally, the references include papers that use techniques such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling to address data bias.
