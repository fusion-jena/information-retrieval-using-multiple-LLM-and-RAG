Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline used in the study referred to in the context involves the use of image data format. Specifically, it deals with the classification of plant species using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on image datasets.

The datasets used in the study consist of images, with each image representing a taxon (plant species). The datasets are divided into source and target datasets, and the CNN model is trained on the source dataset to predict images from the target dataset.

The study uses three source-target pairs for within-dataset classification: GH (high-quality images) to LH (high-quality images), GH to LL (low-quality images), and LL to LH. Additionally, the study investigates the performance of between-dataset classification using a global image database (GH) to predict local samples (LH and LL).

The number of images used for training the CNN model varies for each dataset, with N ranging between 100 and 700 for LH, between 50 and 250 for LL, and between 100 and 900 for GH. The number of test images used for evaluating the consistency of prediction accuracy is 200 for LH and GH, and 50 for LL.

The study also uses TensorFlow 2.5.0 and R 4.1.0 libraries for implementing the deep learning pipeline. The statistical analyses were conducted using R 4.1.0.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline used in the study involves the use of image data format for plant species classification using CNNs.
