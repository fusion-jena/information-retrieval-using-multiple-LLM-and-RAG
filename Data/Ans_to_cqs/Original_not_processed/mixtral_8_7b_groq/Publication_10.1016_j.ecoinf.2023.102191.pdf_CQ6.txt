Answer:::

The provided context does not directly discuss the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does mention some data processing techniques used in a marine life sightings app. These techniques include normalization based on sampling effort, such as location, number of dives, and number of divers. This allows for a more accurate comparison of data.

In the context of deep learning, preprocessing steps often involve data cleaning, normalization, and scaling. Data cleaning involves handling missing values and outliers. Normalization is the process of scaling numeric data to a range of [0,1] or [-1,1] to avoid bias towards features with large values. Scaling is similar to normalization but preserves the original distribution of data. These steps help improve the model's performance and convergence during training.

Therefore, based on general practices in data preprocessing for deep learning and the specific techniques mentioned in the context, we can infer that the following preprocessing steps are likely involved before training a deep learning model for the marine life sightings app:

1. Data cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers in the data.
2. Normalization: Scaling the data to a range of [0,1] or [-1,1] to avoid bias towards features with large values.
3. Sampling effort normalization: Adjusting the data based on location, number of dives, and number of divers to enable accurate comparison.

It is important to note that these steps are inferred from the context and general practices in deep learning and may not be exhaustive or entirely accurate.
