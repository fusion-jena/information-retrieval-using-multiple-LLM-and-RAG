Answer:::
In the provided context, specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for fish biomass estimation are not mentioned. However, general data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning include Flipping, Rotating, and Scaling.

Flipping refers to creating new training samples by horizontally flipping the original images. This technique helps the model generalize better, as it teaches the model to recognize patterns that remain consistent regardless of the image's orientation.

Rotating involves creating new training samples by rotating the original images at various angles. This technique helps the model learn to recognize patterns even when the object of interest is not perfectly aligned with the image frame.

Scaling refers to resizing the original images to different scales. This technique helps the model learn to recognize patterns at different sizes, making it more robust to variations in object size.

In the context of fish biomass estimation, additional data augmentation techniques could include changes in brightness and contrast to simulate different lighting conditions, adding noise to simulate turbid water, and altering hue and saturation to account for variations in water color. These techniques could help improve the model's performance in real-world conditions by increasing its exposure to a diverse range of image variations during training.
