Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used for identifying bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings. The relevant study is titled "A pipeline for identification of bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings using a convolutional neural network" by LeBien et al. (2020), published in Ecological Informatics. However, the context does not offer a link to the code repository used in this study, such as a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket link.
