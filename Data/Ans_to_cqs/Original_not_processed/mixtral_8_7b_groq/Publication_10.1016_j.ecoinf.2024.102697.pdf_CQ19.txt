Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the specific framework used to build the deep learning model. The context refers to a study that uses a deep learning-based data-driven model for detecting time-delay water quality indicators of wastewater treatment plant influent (Zhang et al., 2023). However, it does not specify the framework used for developing the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
