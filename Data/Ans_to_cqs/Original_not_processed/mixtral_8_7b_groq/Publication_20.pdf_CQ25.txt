Answer: The deep learning model is designed for the purpose of classification. Specifically, it is used to classify different species of fish based on thumbnail images. The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which is a type of deep learning algorithm that is particularly effective for image classification tasks. The CNN is composed of 22 layers and uses inception modules, which allow the network to use convolutions of different sizes and weight each of these convolutions. This enables the model to account for the context of each pixel and improve its performance during training. The model was tested using a dataset of 1197 fish thumbnails belonging to 9 species, and it demonstrated a high success rate in classifying the fish species.
