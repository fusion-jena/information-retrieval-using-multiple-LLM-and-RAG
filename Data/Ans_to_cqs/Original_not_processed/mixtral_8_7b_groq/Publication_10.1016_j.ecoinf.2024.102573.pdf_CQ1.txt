The provided context does not directly discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for bird species recognition. However, it does mention the use of datasets and specific preprocessing techniques applied to the data. Therefore, it can be inferred that the raw data is obtained from existing datasets, which could be sourced from surveys, sensors, or other sources.

In the context, it is mentioned that the experiment used both learnable frontends with 80 filters of length 512 (16 ms) that were initialized by mel-filterbanks. This suggests that the raw data used in this study might have been in the form of audio recordings, which were then processed using mel-filterbanks to extract relevant features.

Moreover, the context highlights the debate between using time-frequency representations or waveforms as raw input to neural networks for bird vocalization. This further supports the assumption that the raw data used in these studies is audio recordings, which can be represented as either time-frequency representations or waveforms.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the raw data for deep learning-based bird species recognition is likely collected through audio recordings, which can be obtained from various sources such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. However, the specific methods used for collecting the raw data are not discussed in the provided context.
