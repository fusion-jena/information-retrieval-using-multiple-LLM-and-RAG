Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in the methods described. Common criteria for determining training completion include validation loss plateau, convergence of model parameters, or reaching a pre-specified number of training epochs. In the context, the focus is on the description of a kernel density estimation (KDE) method for classification in DNA barcode sequences, as well as a comparison of its performance with other models. The KDE method involves determining a decision threshold based on outgroup scores, estimating the probability density function (PDF) using an Epanechnikov kernel function, and then calculating the cumulative distribution function (CDF). The classification performance of the proposed model is evaluated using a confusion matrix and three criteria: accuracy, recall, and F1-Score. However, the context does not mention any specific criteria for determining training completion.
