Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of an early stopping criterion known as "patience" in Keras. In this approach, if the validation accuracy does not increase after 50 epochs, the training process is halted. This method helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model's performance on the validation set does not degrade over time. Additionally, the number of samples used for training, validation, and testing in each cross-validation experiment is presented in Table 2. The training and validation sets include samples generated through a data augmentation procedure, which further contributes to enhancing the model's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data.

Furthermore, the sliding window approach is employed to create the results, maintaining the same sample generation approach throughout the hierarchical process. The semantic segmentation is repeated for the first level (forest, grassland, and savanna), followed by the semantic segmentation approach for each resulting savanna and grassland map. The final Cerrado physiognomies map (and the respective accuracy metrics) is composed of the forest map (gallery forest), the savanna map (shrub savanna, typical savanna, woodlands savanna, Rupestrian savanna, and Vereda), and the grassland map (open grassland, shrub grassland, Rupestrian grassland, and humid open grassland).

Lastly, the confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score for the first level of classification are presented in Table 5 using the RGB+EVI2 dataset, with an overall accuracy (OA) of 92.8%. These metrics provide insights into the model's performance, enabling the identification of potential issues and guiding the optimization of the model's architecture and parameters.

In summary, the strategy to monitor the model performance during training includes the use of early stopping, data augmentation, and performance metrics, ensuring that the model's performance on the validation set does not degrade over time and providing a means to assess and improve the model's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data.
