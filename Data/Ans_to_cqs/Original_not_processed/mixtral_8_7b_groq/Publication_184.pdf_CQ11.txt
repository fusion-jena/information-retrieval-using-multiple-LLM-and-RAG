Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. There are several mentions of the datasets used, such as hyperspectral image datasets for classifying fish, as well as fish tracking and counting datasets. However, there is no information about where these datasets are hosted or how to access them. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to the data repository. It is possible that the datasets were obtained directly from the authors or through a private source, rather than being publicly available. If more information were provided, I might be able to give a more specific answer. Nonetheless, I hope this partial answer can be helpful in some way.
