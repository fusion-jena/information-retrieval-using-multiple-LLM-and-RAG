Deep learning models for plant species classification often rely on image annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation. However, the provided context does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines for plant species classification.

In general, bounding box annotation involves drawing a rectangle around the object of interest in an image, providing the coordinates of the box, and labeling it with the corresponding class. This technique is commonly used in object detection tasks, and it can be useful for plant species classification, especially when the focus is on identifying the entire plant or a specific part of it, such as the leaf or the stem.

Instance segmentation, on the other hand, involves segmenting each instance of an object in an image and labeling it with the corresponding class. This technique provides a more detailed representation of the objects in the image, as it separates individual instances of the same class. Instance segmentation can be useful for plant species classification when the focus is on identifying and analyzing individual leaves or other parts of the plant, and it can help in extracting more precise features for the deep learning model.

The context does mention some studies that use deep learning models for plant species classification, such as Chulif et al. (2023), Barhate et al. (2023), and Ganguly et al. (2022). However, these studies do not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipelines.

Other studies mentioned in the context, such as Begue et al. (2017), Pushpa and Rani (2023), Bi et al. (2022), Quach et al. (2023), Azadnia et al. (2022), Bambil et al. (2020), and Barhate et al. (2023), do not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipelines for plant species classification.

In summary, while bounding box annotation and instance segmentation are common data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines for object detection and image segmentation tasks, the provided context does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines for plant species classification.
