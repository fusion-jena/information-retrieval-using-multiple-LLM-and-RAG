Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the purpose of a deep learning model related to sustainable fishing, bycatch, machine-learning, tropical tuna, or fisheries oceanography. However, there are several papers that discuss the use of machine learning and statistical methods in the context of these topics.

For instance, the paper "Smart fishery: a systematic review and research agenda for sustainable fisheries in the age of AI" by Honarmand Ebrahimi et al. (2021) discusses the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in sustainable fisheries. However, it does not mention the specific purpose of a deep learning model.

The paper "Fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions of world fisheries" by Watson (2018) discusses the environmental impact of fisheries, but it does not involve the use of deep learning models.

The paper "Fast training of support vector machines using sequential minimal optimization" by Platt (1998) introduces a new training algorithm for support vector machines (SVMs), which is a type of machine learning model. However, it does not involve deep learning or any specific application in fisheries.

The paper "R Core Team (2021). R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria. URL <https://www.R-project.org/>" describes the R programming language and environment, which is commonly used for statistical computing and data analysis, including machine learning and deep learning. However, it does not provide information on the specific purpose of a deep learning model in the context of sustainable fishing.

The paper "Reilly, S.B., Fiedler, P.C., 1994. Interannual variability of dolphin habitats in the eastern tropical Pacific. I: Research vessel surveys, 1986-1990" by Reilly and Fiedler (1994) investigates the interannual variability of dolphin habitats in the eastern tropical Pacific using research vessel surveys. While it does not involve machine learning or deep learning, it highlights the importance of understanding the ecological dynamics of marine species in the context of sustainable fishing.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the purpose of a deep learning model in the context of sustainable fishing, bycatch, machine-learning, tropical tuna, or fisheries oceanography is not explicitly stated. However, machine learning and statistical methods are commonly used in these fields for various purposes such as data analysis, prediction, and optimization.
