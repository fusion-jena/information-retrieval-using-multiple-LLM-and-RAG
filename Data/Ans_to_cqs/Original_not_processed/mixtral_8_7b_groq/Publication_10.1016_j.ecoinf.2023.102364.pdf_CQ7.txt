Based on the provided context, there is no information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context mainly discusses the use of machine learning ensembles, specifically RandomForest, Treenet, CART, and MARS, for predicting the Resource Selection Index (RIO) of Short-billed Gulls. The data used for this analysis includes various socio-economic attributes from the US Census 2000, GIS data from Fairbanks Borough, forest layer data from the Tanana Valley, and other environmental variables such as vegetation name, soil type, and distance to water.

However, the process of splitting the data into training, testing, and validation sets is typically an essential step in any machine learning or deep learning project. This step is crucial for evaluating the performance and generalization ability of the model. Common methods for splitting the data include random sampling, stratified sampling, or temporal splitting.

Therefore, while the context provides valuable information about the study's methodology and findings, it does not explicitly state the criteria used for splitting the data for deep learning model training.
