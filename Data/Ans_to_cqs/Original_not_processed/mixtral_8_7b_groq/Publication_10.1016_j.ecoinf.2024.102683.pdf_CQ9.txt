Answer:

The provided context does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the description of the proposed FAA-based approach and SCAM-Herb model, which includes the use of attention mechanisms, data augmentation techniques, and pooling operations for identifying medicinal plants from similar poisonous plants. However, it does not mention where the data repository is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
