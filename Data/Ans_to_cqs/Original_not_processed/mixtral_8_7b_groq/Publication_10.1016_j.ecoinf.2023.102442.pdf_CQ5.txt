The provided pieces of context do not specify the exact dataset used in the deep learning pipeline for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana. However, they do mention that Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used for initial land use and land cover (LULC) classification. GEE is a cloud-based platform that provides access to petabytes of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets. Therefore, it can be inferred that the dataset used in this study likely consists of high-resolution satellite images of the study area in Ghana, available through GEE.

The study by Couttenier et al. (2022) used a dataset consisting of 2,890,320 Sentinel-2 satellite images to train a deep learning model for mapping artisanal and small-scale mines at a large scale. Although this study is not the exact one referenced in the context, it demonstrates the use of Sentinel-2 images in a similar deep learning pipeline.

In summary, while the exact dataset used in the deep learning pipeline for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana is not specified in the provided context, it can be inferred that the dataset likely consists of high-resolution satellite images of the study area, obtained through the Google Earth Engine platform.
