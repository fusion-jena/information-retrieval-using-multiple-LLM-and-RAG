Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context focuses on the process of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) and data mining for identifying patterns or relationships within a dataset, specifically in the context of analyzing plant protection products (PPPs) in Puglia surface water bodies.

The study includes various steps such as identification of the aim, pre-selection of useful data, analytical determinations, and optimization and elaboration of the obtained results. Different data processing techniques were integrated, relying on an operational workflow based on the KDD paradigm. However, there is no mention of the deep learning pipeline or the data repository used in the study.

The study does mention that an automatic elaboration workflow was implemented with open-source software without using an operator who reprocesses the data each time. This suggests that the data and code used in the study may be publicly available, but the context does not provide information on where it can be found.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study.
