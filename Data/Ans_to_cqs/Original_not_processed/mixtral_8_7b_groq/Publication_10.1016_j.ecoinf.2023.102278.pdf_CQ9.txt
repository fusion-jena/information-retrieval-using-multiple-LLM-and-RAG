Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it does mention the use of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) in the context of insect studies. GBIF is a data repository that focuses on biodiversity information, including species occurrence data, which could potentially be used in a deep learning pipeline for insect classification.

Additionally, the study by Gupta et al. (2022) on hierarchical object detection for fish species may also have used a data repository, but the context does not provide information on where it is available.

Therefore, while it is possible that the data repository is available on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, the provided context does not give a definitive answer.
