Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the use of a mobile app for biodiversity data collection in marine environments, specifically through recreational SCUBA diving. The study tested a novel approach that combines elements of standardized data collection with the simplicity of recreational diving. The mobile app used in the study likely involved some level of data processing and analysis, but there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or any code repository where the code for such a pipeline might be found. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
