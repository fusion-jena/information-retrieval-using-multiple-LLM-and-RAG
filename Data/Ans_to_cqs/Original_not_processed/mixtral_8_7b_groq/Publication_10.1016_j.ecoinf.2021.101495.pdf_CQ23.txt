Answer:::

The generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through several measures. First, the model was trained on a diverse dataset that included 14,896 images, which were augmented to a total of 178,776 images (x12) for increased variability. The dataset consisted of 22 out of the 30 fishing sets, which were unannotated, and the data from these sets was used for species prediction and size distribution comparison. The ground truth validation was performed using data from four fishing sets obtained from official sources and estimations.

Second, data augmentation was used to increase the size and diversity of the training set, which helped the model learn more robust features and improve its ability to generalize to new data. As shown in Fig. 7, the classification model was able to learn in fewer steps and with better accuracy when data augmentation was used.

Third, the model was trained using a train/test split of 90/10, which allowed for a sufficient amount of data to be used for training while also providing a holdout set for evaluation. This split was applied to both the segmentation and classification models.

Finally, the use of Nvidia Tesla V100 (16GB) computing infrastructure allowed for extensive manual tuning of hyperparameters, which further improved the model's ability to generalize. The best assignments of hyperparameters for the segmentation and classification models are provided in Table 2, along with the search space used for each hyperparameter.

In summary, the generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through the use of a diverse dataset, data augmentation, a train/test split, and extensive manual tuning of hyperparameters. These measures helped the model learn robust features and improve its ability to generalize to new data.
