The provided context discusses a study that uses a combination of sensor data and public datasets in their deep learning pipeline. Specifically, they used a Phoenix receiver to determine sample locations and collect soil samples. This sensor data was then combined with remote sensing image data from Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands, accessed through Google Earth Engine (GEE). 

In this study, the Phoenix receiver was used to determine the precise locations for collecting soil samples. At each location, three five-cm-diameter cores of 15-cm length were taken, and then blended to obtain a representative sample of the soil at that site. A total of 300 representative soil samples were collected.

In addition to the sensor data, the researchers also utilized remote sensing image data from Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands, which have a 30-m resolution. These images were accessed through Google Earth Engine (GEE) on April 21, 2023. The image pre-processing included geometric, radiometric, and image mosaicking, and cropping. The slope, aspect, drainage, and parent material of the topographic variables from DEM were calculated using the System for Automated Geoscientific Analysis (SAGA) GIS. After image processing, the original image's Digital Number provided the measured Surface Reflectance (SR). The TOA and SR picture sets from Google Earth Engine (GEE) helped to speed up data processing.

Therefore, in this particular deep learning pipeline, the researchers utilized a combination of sensor data (Phoenix receiver) and public datasets (remote sensing image data from Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands accessed through Google Earth Engine) to collect raw data.
