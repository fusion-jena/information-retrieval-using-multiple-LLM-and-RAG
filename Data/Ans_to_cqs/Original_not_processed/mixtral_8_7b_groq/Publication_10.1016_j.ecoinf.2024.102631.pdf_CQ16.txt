Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the training process might be determined by a validation loss plateau or other performance metrics on the UCCS, C-60, and U45 datasets.

In the context, several quantitative comparisons are presented using UIQM, UCIQE, and NIQE metrics for different image enhancement methods. These metrics seem to be essential for evaluating the performance of the models. Therefore, it is plausible that the training process might be monitored and stopped based on these or similar metrics.

UIQM (Unified Image Quality Metric) is a linear combination of UICM, UISM, and UIConM, which represent colorfulness, sharpness, and contrast metrics, respectively. A higher UIQM score indicates better performance. UCIQE (Underwater Image Quality Metric with Enhancement) measures the balance between chroma, contrast, and saturation, with a higher score indicating improved performance. NIQE (Naturalness Image Quality Evaluator) estimates the naturalness of the image, with a lower score indicating better performance.

Answer:::
While the specific criteria for determining when training is complete are not provided in the context, it can be inferred that the training process might be monitored using performance metrics such as UIQM, UCIQE, and NIQE. The training could be stopped when a validation loss plateau is reached or when the model achieves satisfactory performance based on these metrics.
