Answer:::

The text provided does not give explicit information about the specific deep learning framework used in the CityNet project. However, it does mention the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for large-scale classification of sound data.

Two deep learning frameworks that are particularly well-suited for building CNNs are TensorFlow and PyTorch. TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google Brain Team, while PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. Both frameworks have been widely adopted in the machine learning and data science communities for building and training deep learning models.

Given that the authors of the CityNet project used Python for their implementation, it is possible that they used either TensorFlow or PyTorch to build their deep learning model. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
