Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training for H. ovalis detection. However, it is common to calculate various metrics, generate confusion matrices, and use visualization techniques like saliency maps for model evaluation and interpretation.

In the context provided, the focus is mainly on the dataset preparation, model architecture (CSPDarknet and PANet or EfficientDet), and the training procedure. There is no mention of any particular postprocessing techniques employed in this specific approach.

Answer:::
While the given context does not provide information on the postprocessing steps for this particular H. ovalis detection method, common postprocessing techniques include calculating metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score), generating confusion matrices, and visualizing the model's attention with saliency maps.
