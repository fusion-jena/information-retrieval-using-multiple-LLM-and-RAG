Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the application of the Apriori algorithm for identifying frequent itemsets in a dataset, but it does not mention any techniques for hyperparameter tuning such as grid search or random search.

Hyperparameter tuning is an essential step in machine learning models to ensure optimal performance. Grid search and random search are two common methods for hyperparameter tuning. Grid search involves creating a grid of hyperparameter values and training the model with each combination to find the best set of hyperparameters. In contrast, random search selects hyperparameters at random and trains the model, which can be more efficient than grid search.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it is essential to note that hyperparameter tuning is a crucial step in machine learning model development, and the Apriori algorithm's performance may depend on the appropriate selection of its hyperparameters.
