The specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the initial learning rate of the model is 0.001 and it is exponentially decayed every 3 epochs with a factor of 0.94. This suggests that some form of gradient descent is being used, as the learning rate is a key parameter in these types of optimization algorithms.

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a common optimization algorithm used in deep learning. It involves iteratively adjusting the model's weights in the direction that minimally reduces the loss function. The learning rate determines the size of the steps taken in this direction. Exponential decay of the learning rate is a technique used to slow down the learning process as the model becomes more confident, which can help prevent overshooting the minimum loss.

Another optimization algorithm that is commonly used in deep learning is Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation. Adam is an extension of SGD that adaptively adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on estimates of the first and second moments of the gradient. This can result in faster convergence and better performance than SGD in some cases.

Without more information, it is not possible to say for certain which optimization algorithm was used in this study. However, based on the information provided, it is likely that some form of gradient descent was used, possibly with exponential decay of the learning rate.
