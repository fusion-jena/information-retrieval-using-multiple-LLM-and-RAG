The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does provide information about the training and testing of a model for salient object detection (SOD) in tree trunks.

In the context, the dataset is divided randomly into a training set and a testing set using a ratio of 65% to 35%, respectively. This implies the use of some form of randomness in the division of the dataset. However, the specific method for implementing this randomness is not discussed.

Furthermore, the model training is supervised with the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted probability and the actual value. While the BCE loss function itself does not directly involve randomness, the training process may involve randomness in the form of data augmentation or the initialization of model weights.

Data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to increase the size and diversity of the training set by applying random transformations to the training data. This can include transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping. By applying these transformations randomly, the model can learn to be more robust to variations in the input data.

The initialization of model weights can also involve randomness. In deep learning, the weights of the model are typically initialized with random values. This helps to break symmetry in the network and allows the model to learn different features from the input data.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does imply the use of randomness in the division of the dataset and possibly in the training process through data augmentation and the initialization of model weights. However, the specific methods for implementing this randomness are not discussed.
