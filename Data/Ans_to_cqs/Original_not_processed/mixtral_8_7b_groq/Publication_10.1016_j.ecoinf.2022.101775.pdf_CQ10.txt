Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct link to a code repository for the deep learning pipeline. However, there are some references to tools and libraries that could be used to implement such a pipeline.

For instance, the context mentions the use of stochastic gradient descent for optimizing a regularized cost function, which is a common technique in deep learning. Additionally, the context mentions the use of embedding layers, which are also commonly used in deep learning, particularly in natural language processing and collaborative filtering.

The context also mentions the use of PyTorch, a popular open-source machine learning library, in the implementation of a large-scale graph embedding system. Furthermore, the context references scikit-learn, another popular open-source machine learning library, which provides a wide range of machine learning algorithms and tools for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and visualization.

Therefore, while there is no direct link to a code repository for the deep learning pipeline, one could potentially use tools and libraries such as PyTorch and scikit-learn to implement a similar pipeline. Additionally, one could refer to the papers and technical reports cited in the context for more details on the specific techniques and approaches used in the pipeline.
