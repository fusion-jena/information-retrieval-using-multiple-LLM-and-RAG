Answer:::

Based on the information provided, the data repository for the study on Short-billed Gull Larus canus using a GIS and a machine learning ensemble approach is not explicitly stated to be hosted on any of the commonly used data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, it is mentioned that the data is shared open access, and a link is provided to view the data (<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VaF7LOBTwUdLZuSs1qYZKV9MZ3j18SoN/view?usp=drive_link>). The data availability statement also mentions that the data and metadata follow ISO standards and are available in the appendices.

An examination of the appendices reveals that the data includes GIS files for the study area, lattice, and Fairbanks City boundary, as well as survey data for the Short-billed Gull with ISO-compliant metadata. The data and metadata are crucial for reproducibility and further analysis of the study.

Therefore, while the data is available and linked in the article, it is not explicitly stated to be hosted on any of the commonly used data repositories. It is important to note that data archiving and sharing on recognized repositories ensures long-term accessibility, discoverability, and citation of the data.
