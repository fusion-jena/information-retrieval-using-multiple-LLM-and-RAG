Answer:

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does provide information about various models and methods used in the classification process of satellite images.

Data augmentation is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the diversity of data available for training models, without actually collecting new data. Common techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, and translating images, as well as changing their brightness, contrast, and hue.

While the context does not mention these techniques specifically, it does discuss the use of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model in the classification process. VAEs are a type of autoencoder that can be used for data augmentation by learning a latent space representation of the input data, and then generating new samples by sampling from this latent space. This can help to increase the size and diversity of the training set, and improve the performance of the model.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of the EfficientNetB0 model for evaluating efficiency. EfficientNet is a family of models that have been designed to be efficient in terms of both accuracy and computational resources. One way that these models achieve efficiency is by using data augmentation techniques during training, such as flipping, rotating, and scaling the input images.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific details on the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling were used, either explicitly or implicitly through the use of models like VAEs and EfficientNet.
