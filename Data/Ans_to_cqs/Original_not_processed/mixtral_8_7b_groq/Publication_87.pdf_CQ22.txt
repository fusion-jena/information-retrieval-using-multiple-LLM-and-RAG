Answer:::
The three metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, recall, and precision. 

Accuracy is the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. It gives a general idea of how well the model is performing. In the provided context, accuracy is calculated for each epoch during the training of the model.

Recall, also known as sensitivity, is a measure of false negatives. It is the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN). Recall is important when the focus is on common species, as it measures the proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly by the model.

Precision, also known as positive predictive value, is a measure of false positives. It is the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false positives (FP). Precision is important when the focus is on rare species, as it measures the proportion of positive identifications that were correct.

In the context provided, the deep learning model is used for species identification in camera trap studies. The choice of metric to optimize depends on the focus of the study. If the focus is on rare species, precision should be optimized, while recall should be optimized if the focus is on common species.
