Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about a deep learning model being used in the research. The context mainly discusses the use of machine learning models, specifically intelligent models based on the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), for predicting the Water Quality Index (WQI) at the Kinta River basin.

The purpose of the machine learning models used in this research is to predict WQI using seven Water Quality Parameters (WQPs) as inputs. The models were developed with a focus on precise data selection for training using clusters and time series analysis. The efficiency of these models is attributed to this careful data selection and the similar number of inputs used, resulting in similar model efficiency for training and testing.

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide an answer regarding the purpose of a deep learning model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection) as no such information is provided.
