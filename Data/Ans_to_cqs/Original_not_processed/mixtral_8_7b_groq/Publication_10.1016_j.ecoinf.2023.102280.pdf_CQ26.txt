The provided context discusses the use of deep learning techniques for noise reduction in bioacoustics, but it does not explicitly mention the strategies used to address data bias during preprocessing. However, it does touch upon some related concepts, such as the challenges of generating training data for fine-tuning and the limitations of dataset availability in the field of bioacoustics.

In general, techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in a deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific characteristics (strata) and then ensuring that each stratum is proportionally represented in the training, validation, and test sets. This can help maintain balance and avoid bias in the data distribution.
2. Oversampling: When certain classes or categories are underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from these classes. This can help balance the dataset and prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
3. Undersampling: Conversely, when certain classes or categories are overrepresented in the dataset, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of instances from these classes. This can help balance the dataset and prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources, locations, and conditions can help ensure that the dataset is representative and less prone to bias. This can be particularly important in bioacoustics, where the sparsity of vocalisations and limited availability of clean recordings can introduce bias.

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the authors faced challenges related to data bias due to the limited availability of clean recordings and the sparsity of vocalisations in bioacoustic applications. However, they do not explicitly mention the strategies they used to address these challenges during preprocessing. Nonetheless, the techniques listed above are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to mitigate data bias and improve model performance.
