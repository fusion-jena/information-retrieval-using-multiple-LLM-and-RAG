Answer:::

The specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline for enhancing groundwater-climate interactions understanding and investigating climatic hotspots implications within the sub-basins of the GAB region are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it does mention several types of data that are used in the study, which can give us an idea of the possible data formats.

The study used several datasets, including TWS (terrestrial water storage), SMS (soil moisture storage), GWS (groundwater storage), SPEI (standard precipitation evapotranspiration index), ENSO (El-Ni√±o southern oscillation), NAO (North Atlantic oscillation), AMO (Atlantic multidecadal oscillation), PDO (Pacific decadal oscillation), IOD (Indian ocean dipole), NTA (North Tropical Atlantic), STA (South Tropical Atlantic), and ETA (Equatorial Atlantic).

The SPEI dataset was obtained from <https://spei.csic.es/database.html> as a drought indicator, and it was derived using a water balance framework based on the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. The SPEI data was utilized as a drought marker to reflect the fluctuation in precipitation extremes (dry and wet climate).

The spatial and temporal resolution and sources of these datasets are shown in Table 1, and specific data information is shown in Table 1 and also in Fig. 2. However, the context does not provide information on the data formats used for these datasets.

Based on the types of datasets mentioned, it can be inferred that the data formats used in this study are likely to be CSV or similar text-based formats, as these are commonly used for climatological and hydrological data. However, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer without additional information.
