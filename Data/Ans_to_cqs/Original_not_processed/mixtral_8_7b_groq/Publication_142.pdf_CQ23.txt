The text provided does not give explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in the Pl@ntNet application. However, it does mention that the model is fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data, which suggests that the model was initially pre-trained on a different dataset (ImageNet) and then adapted to the specific task of plant identification using the Pl@ntNet data. This is a common approach in deep learning to improve generalizability, as it allows the model to learn general features from the initial dataset and then specialize to the task at hand using the fine-tuning data.

Additionally, the text mentions that the Pl@ntNet CNN covers 30,261 species illustrated by more than 2.9 million images, which suggests a diverse dataset. A diverse dataset can help improve the generalizability of a deep learning model, as it exposes the model to a wide variety of inputs and reduces the risk of overfitting to a specific subset of the data.

However, the text does not mention any specific techniques used to ensure generalizability, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a model by dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on one subset and testing it on another, and repeating this process with different subsets. This can help ensure that the model performs well on unseen data and is not overfitting to the training data. Stratified splitting is a technique used to divide a dataset into training and testing subsets in a way that preserves the distribution of important variables, such as class labels in a classification task. This can help ensure that the training and testing subsets are representative of the overall dataset and that the model is able to generalize to new data.

In summary, while the text suggests that the Pl@ntNet deep learning model was pre-trained on a diverse dataset and fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data, it does not provide explicit information about the use of techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting to ensure generalizability.
