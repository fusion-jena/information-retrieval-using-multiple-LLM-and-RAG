Based on the provided context, the training of the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is not determined to be complete based on a validation loss plateau. Instead, the VAE is trained for a maximum of 100,000 batches. The learning rate is annealed using a cosine function over the duration of the training to prevent overfitting and maximize reconstruction quality.

The validation loss is used in the training process, but it is not specified as the criterion for determining when training is complete. Instead, the validation samples are aggregated into the test set, and a binary logistic regression model is fit for each site pair. The model finds a weight vector w and an orthogonal hyperplane Z(a,b)w + b = 0 for each site pair. After classification, a sample is selected from each site, and the representation time-series is encoded. A linear transformation of each time step is then applied independently by interpolating along the gradient of the regression line orthogonal to the hyperplane, adding the weights scaled by distance Î´.

Therefore, the training of the VAE is based on a fixed number of batches, and the validation loss is used to evaluate the model's performance but not to determine when training is complete.
