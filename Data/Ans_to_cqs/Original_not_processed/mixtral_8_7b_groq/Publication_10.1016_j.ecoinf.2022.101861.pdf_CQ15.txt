Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the BirdNET app or the study related to identifying the Brazilian nightjar.

However, it is mentioned that the BirdNET app uses machine learning-powered algorithms for bird species identification. Common optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines for training machine learning models include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), and others. These techniques are used to minimize the error or loss function of the model by adjusting the weights and biases of the neural network during the training process.

In the study related to the Brazilian nightjar, the focus is on creating a combined index for species identification based on the number of scientific articles, observations on a citizen science platform, and recordings on a public online database of sounds. While they use machine learning algorithms for sound analysis, the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned.

Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer regarding the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for the BirdNET app or the Brazilian nightjar study.
