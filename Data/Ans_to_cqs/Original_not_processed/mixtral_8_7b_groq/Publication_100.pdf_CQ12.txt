Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the description of the model architecture where convolutional layers are used as the primary building blocks. The authors have implemented their models in PyTorch, and the model architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers interleaved with element-wise, non-linear activation functions. The convolutional layers gradually transform the input image into output feature maps by applying multiple convolutions with different filter weights. The filter weights are the trainable parameters of the model. The authors have also provided a figure (Figure 5) that illustrates the proposed model architecture, where convolutional layers are shown in cyan. Therefore, it can be concluded that the authors have used a CNN in their pipeline.
