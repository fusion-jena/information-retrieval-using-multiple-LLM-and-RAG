Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline for analyzing and classifying geographical features, such as vegetation or land use, typically involves the use of satellite or aerial imagery as the primary source of raw data. These images are often acquired through sensors mounted on satellites or aircraft, which capture reflected light in various wavelengths, providing information about different aspects of the observed surface.

For example, in the context of studying the Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado), Neves et al. (2021) used high spatial resolution satellite data to map the physiognomies of the region. Similarly, Guirado et al. (2017) utilized Google Earth imagery with four spectral bands (red, green, blue, and near-infrared) to detect scattered shrubs using deep learning techniques.

Publicly available datasets also play a significant role in deep learning applications for remote sensing. For instance, the ImageNet dataset, which includes handwritten digit recognition tasks (LeCun et al., 1990), has been instrumental in the development of deep learning models. More recently, Krizhevsky et al. (2012) used the ImageNet dataset to train deep convolutional neural networks for image classification, significantly improving state-of-the-art performance.

In addition to satellite and aerial imagery, other sources of raw data can include ground-based surveys or LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data. While not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, these methods can be used to collect detailed information about specific features or objects on the ground, which can then be integrated into the deep learning pipeline.

An essential aspect of deep learning is the use of training data to learn features that help identify desired classes or objects. As a result, it might not always be necessary to provide the network with supplementary information, such as additional spectral bands. For instance, Zhang et al. (2017) tested the efficiency of using datasets with four and eight bands from WorldView-2 and WorldView-3 images. While more bands generally improve results, they observed that some bands, like the yellow band (present in the 8-band dataset), did not improve the classification of vegetation patterns.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline for analyzing and classifying geographical features typically involves the use of satellite or aerial imagery, often acquired through sensors, as the primary source of raw data. Publicly available datasets and ground-based surveys or LiDAR data can also contribute to the pipeline. Deep learning models learn features from training data to identify desired classes, so the necessity of providing supplementary information, such as additional spectral bands, may vary depending on the specific application.
