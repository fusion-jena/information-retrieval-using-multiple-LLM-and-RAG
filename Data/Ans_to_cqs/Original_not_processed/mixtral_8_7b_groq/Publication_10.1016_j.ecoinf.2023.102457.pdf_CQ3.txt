The provided context discusses the use of pre-trained models and deep learning methods for individual gibbon discrimination through passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) but does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of embeddings, which are typically generated from labeled data.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines can include various forms of labeling, such as:

1. Image-level classification: This is the simplest form of annotation where an image is assigned a single label indicating the presence or absence of a particular object or class.
2. Bounding box annotation: This involves drawing a bounding box around an object of interest in an image, providing the x and y coordinates of the box's top-left and bottom-right corners.
3. Semantic segmentation: This is a more detailed form of annotation where each pixel in an image is assigned a label indicating the object or class it belongs to.
4. Instance segmentation: This is a further refinement of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is separately labeled and segmented, allowing for the identification of individual objects within an image.

In the context of the study mentioned, it is likely that some form of bounding box annotation or instance segmentation was used to label the bird vocalization data used to train the BirdNET model. However, the specific annotation technique used is not mentioned in the provided context.

It is also worth noting that recent studies have shown the potential of self-supervised learning methods, such as auto-encoders, for efficiently classifying unlabeled data. These methods can reduce the need for laborious and time-consuming manual annotation of large datasets.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that some form of bounding box annotation or instance segmentation was used for the bird vocalization data. Additionally, recent studies have shown the potential of self-supervised learning methods for reducing the need for manual annotation of large datasets.
