The provided context does not discuss the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It mainly focuses on the use of the FIT pairwise comparison model for classifying and predicting the sex of Amur tigers using their footprints. The text mentions the creation of sub-trails, data validation to determine the optimal size for algorithm training and test sets, and algorithm training using data from captive Amur tigers. However, it does not specify any data preprocessing steps, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, that were performed before training the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to the query based on the given context.
