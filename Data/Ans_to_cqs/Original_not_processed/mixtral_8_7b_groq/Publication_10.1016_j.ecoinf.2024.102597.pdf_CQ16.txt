Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the machine learning models used in the study. However, it is mentioned that hyperparameter optimization was performed using both random grid search and Bayesian optimization methods. These methods typically involve monitoring the performance of the model on a validation set during the training process and adjusting the parameters based on the observed performance. Common criteria for determining when training is complete include a validation loss plateau, where the loss on the validation set stops decreasing even with further training, or a patience parameter, where training is stopped if the validation loss does not improve for a certain number of epochs. It is also possible that other criteria were used in this study, such as early stopping based on the performance on a separate test set or monitoring other metrics such as accuracy or precision. Without more specific information from the context, it is not possible to give a definitive answer to this query.
