The strategy implemented to monitor the model's performance during training involves the use of several model accuracy evaluation parameters. These parameters include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2). The MAE shows the average magnitude of errors in predictions without considering their direction, and in this case, it indicates that the prediction model deviates 4.1% from actual Volumetric Water Content (VWC). The RMSE, which is more sensitive to outliers as it squares residuals, is slightly higher than MAE at 5.6%, providing a similar interpretation to MAE but emphasizing larger prediction errors. The R2 value of 0.49 shows that the model explains 49% of the variance in the observed VWC values, indicating a moderate ability of the model to capture the relation between the explanatory variable and VWC.

Additionally, the model's performance was assessed using the 'yardstick' package for R, specifically the 'metrics' function. The model's parameters were estimated using the method recommended by the authors of the mgcv library, with automatic elimination of variables with little impact on the modeled explanatory variable. The smoothing parameter estimation, part of model fitting, could completely remove the influence of a specific variable in the model. Due to the skewed distribution of the modeled variable VWC, a gamma distribution with a natural logarithm as the linking function was used for modeling.

The model's performance was monitored during training by calculating three selected model parameters: RMSE, MAE, and R2. MAE measures the average magnitude of errors in predictions without considering their direction, while RMSE is more sensitive to outliers as it squares residuals. R2 represents the proportion of variability in the response variable that can be explained by the model. These parameters provided a comprehensive view of the model's performance during training, allowing for adjustments and improvements to be made as necessary.
