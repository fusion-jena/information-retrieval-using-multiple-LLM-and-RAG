Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The study describes the methodology and results of a deep learning approach for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome in Brazil, but it does not give information on where the code for the pipeline can be found. The study was published in the journal Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment, and the authors are from the Amazon Environmental Research Institute and the Forestry Department at the University of Bras√≠lia. The study used data from Landsat imagery, Google Earth Engine, and a deep neural network, but the code repository was not provided.
