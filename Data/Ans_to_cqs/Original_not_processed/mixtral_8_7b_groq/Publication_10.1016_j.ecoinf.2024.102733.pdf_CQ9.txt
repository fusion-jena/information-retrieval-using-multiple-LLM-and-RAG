Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide the specific location of the data repository (e.g., Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF) based on the given information. It is important to note that reproducibility and accessibility of data and methods are crucial in research and should be documented appropriately. In this case, the authors have not mentioned the data repository, making it difficult for others to locate or access the input data used in their study.
