Answer:::

The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the metric of average precision (AP). Additionally, the answer provides information about other possible evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

The average precision (AP) metric is calculated by considering all predictions as positive that have an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of at least 0.5. The IoU score measures the overlap between the predicted bounding boxes and the ground truth bounding boxes. The higher the IoU score, the better the match between the predicted and ground truth bounding boxes. The average precision at an IoU threshold of 0.5 is called AP50, and similarly, the average precision with a minimum IoU of 0.75 is called AP75. The AP metric is calculated as the average over 10 IoU levels from 0.5 to 0.95 with a step size of 0.05.

Other possible evaluation metrics for deep learning models include accuracy, precision, and recall. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made. Precision measures the proportion of true positives (correctly predicted positive instances) out of all positive predictions made. Recall measures the proportion of true positives out of all actual positive instances.

In the context of the provided information, the deep learning model's performance is evaluated using the AP metric. However, it is important to note that other evaluation metrics can also be used depending on the specific problem and the desired trade-off between different performance measures.
