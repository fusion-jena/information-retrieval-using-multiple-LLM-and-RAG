Answer:::
The provided context does not include information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text discusses various topics related to machine learning and statistical modeling, including the use of machine learning for species identification, the importance of including all observations in statistical modeling, and the need for evaluating the performance of automated identification software using real-world examples. However, it does not mention any details about the hardware used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, I am unable to answer this question without additional information.
