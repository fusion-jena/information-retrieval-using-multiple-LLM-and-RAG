Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the specific deep learning frameworks used in the studies. The texts discuss various applications of machine learning and image classification in different fields, but they do not mention the use of TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other deep learning frameworks.

In the Blondel et al. (2011) paper, the authors introduce scikit-learn, a machine learning library for Python, but it is mainly focused on traditional machine learning algorithms rather than deep learning. Similarly, the Petty et al. (2012), Prasai et al. (2021), and Hayes et al. (2014) papers discuss land use and land cover classification, remote sensing, and image analysis, but they do not specify the deep learning frameworks used.

The He (2009) paper talks about learning from imbalanced data, which can be an issue in deep learning, but it does not mention any deep learning frameworks. The Humeau-Heurtier (2019) paper discusses texture feature extraction methods, which can be used in deep learning models, but it does not mention any specific deep learning frameworks either.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which deep learning frameworks were used in these studies.
