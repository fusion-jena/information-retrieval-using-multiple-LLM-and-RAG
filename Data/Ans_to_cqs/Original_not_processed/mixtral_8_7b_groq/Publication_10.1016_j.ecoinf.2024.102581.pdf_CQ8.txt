Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several research papers and tables comparing the performance of various deep learning models for different tasks such as pine tree classification, plant leaf disease classification, and plant disease classification. However, none of the papers mention or provide a link to the code repository. It is possible that the authors have not made the code publicly available, or it may be available on a different platform or through direct contact with the authors.
