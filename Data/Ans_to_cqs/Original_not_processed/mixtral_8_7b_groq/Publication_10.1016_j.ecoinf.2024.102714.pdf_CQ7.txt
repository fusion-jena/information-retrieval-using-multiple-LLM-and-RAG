Answer: The data for the deep learning model was split using specific criteria to ensure the model's accuracy and reliability. The areas dominated by the target communities were digitized as polygons, and all pixels contained were extracted. These polygons were then split into calibration and validation sets, with approximately 30% of pixels for each vegetation type (VT) reserved for independent model validation. The polygons were split rather than pixels to minimize the effect of spatial autocorrelation on model accuracies.

The XGBoostClassifier, a Python implementation of the optimized random trees algorithm, was used to classify the VTs. The algorithm learns from the errors of the previous trees, enabling the development of robust and accurate models. As input to the ML algorithm, seasonal vegetation index composites from S2, backscatter composites from S1, elevation, and slope were used, totaling 54 features. The compositing periods were chosen based on the coverage of specific vegetation types, such as U. galli, Molina grassland, M. caerulea, Juncus spp., and others.

Furthermore, the accuracy assessment at the detailed classification level was conducted for Pembrokeshire County in 2022. A dedicated survey of vegetated semi-natural habitats was undertaken using the EarthTrack mobile application developed through Living Wales. The accuracy assessment showed that classes that were extensive across the country or those dominated by a single or just a few species were mapped with relatively high accuracies. The classification of these classes was strongly driven by EO-datasets and benefited from systematic integration of each class-specific optimized data-layers.

Therefore, the data was split based on the vegetation types, and the accuracy assessment was conducted based on the detailed classification level, ensuring the model's accuracy and reliability.
