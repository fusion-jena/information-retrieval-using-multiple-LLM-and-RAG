Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no specific information given about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, there are several resources mentioned that discuss the use of deep learning for bioacoustic classification, including the use of marine mammal echolocation signals.

One paper by Li et al. (2020a) mentions using a deep neural network for beaked whale species classification using echolocation signals. They used a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture and trained the model using a large dataset of labeled echolocation signals. However, they do not provide details on how the trained model was deployed.

Another paper by Stowell (2022) provides a review of computational bioacoustics with deep learning, including the use of CNNs and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for bioacoustic classification. They mention the importance of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, but do not discuss model deployment.

The PAMpal package mentioned in the context is a tool for managing and analyzing passive acoustic data, but it does not appear to include functionality for deploying trained deep learning models.

Therefore, while there are several resources mentioned that discuss the use of deep learning for bioacoustic classification, there is no specific information provided on the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model.
