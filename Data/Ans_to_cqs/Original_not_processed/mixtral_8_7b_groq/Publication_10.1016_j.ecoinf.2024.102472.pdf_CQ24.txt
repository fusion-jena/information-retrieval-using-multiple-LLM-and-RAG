Answer:::

The provided context discusses various methods used in machine learning and deep learning models, but it does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does discuss the use of hyperparameter tuning and grid search methods in the context of gradient boosting and artificial neural networks.

In gradient boosting, a repetition process of increasing or decreasing weights in a training dataset is used to optimize the model. Hyperparameters, such as the number of estimators, learning rate, and maximum depth, can be tuned using a grid search method to find the optimal combination of parameters. While not explicitly stated, the use of a random seed value could be employed during the cross-validation process to ensure consistent and reproducible results.

Similarly, in the context of artificial neural networks, initial arbitrary connection weights are assigned, and iterative error back-propagation adjusts connection weights until reaching a target minimal error. Hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, momentum, and training iterations, are tested to determine the optimal values for accurately estimating carbon stocks. Again, while not explicitly stated, the use of a random seed value could be employed during the training and testing process to ensure consistent and reproducible results.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value, it does discuss the use of hyperparameter tuning and grid search methods in the context of gradient boosting and artificial neural networks. These methods could potentially employ the use of a random seed value to ensure consistent and reproducible results during the cross-validation, training, and testing process.
