Unfortunately, the context provided does not give information about the specific code repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It is mentioned that the implementation of the classification methods, including the deep learning pipeline, was carried out in Python using the libraries TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. However, there is no information about the repository where the code is stored and maintained.

It is possible that the code repository is not publicly available yet, or it may be hosted in a different platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. In any case, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query.

Therefore, my answer is:

Answer:::
I couldn't find information in the provided context about the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It may not be publicly available or hosted in a different platform.
