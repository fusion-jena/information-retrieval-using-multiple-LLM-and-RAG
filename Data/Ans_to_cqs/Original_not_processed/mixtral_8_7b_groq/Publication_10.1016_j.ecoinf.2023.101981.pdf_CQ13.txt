Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. However, the text does mention that the model used supervised machine learning algorithms and that the model detected a larger number of cow vocalizations than a previous study. It is possible that different hyperparameters were used in this model compared to the previous study, leading to the improved detection rate. Additionally, the model used cow-specific parameters, which could also impact the hyperparameters chosen. Without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to this query.
