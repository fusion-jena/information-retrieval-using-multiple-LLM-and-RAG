Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. The text describes the methods and results of a scientific investigation that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract plant functional traits from RGB photographs. However, it does not give any details about the code repository or the computational tools used to implement the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
