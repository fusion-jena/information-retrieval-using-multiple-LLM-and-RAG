The text provided does not give specific details about the steps taken to deploy the trained deep learning model after training. However, it does provide some context about the training process and the model used.

The model used in this study is YOLOv5, a popular deep learning model for object detection tasks. The training process involves iteratively generating predictions of the training set samples, evaluating them by a loss function, and modifying the model's parameters according to the loss function's gradient. This process continues for a set number of epochs, with the number of epochs determined based on validation runs. In this study, 30 epochs were used per training task.

Once the model is trained, it is evaluated based on its performance on the training set and validation set. The text mentions that the model's average precision (AP) improves with the number of training epochs, and provides a plot of the model's mean AP (mAP) over the three insect classes.

However, the text does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed or implemented in a production environment. Model serialization, platform selection, and other deployment considerations are important steps in making a deep learning model useful in practice.

Answer:::
The text provides information on the training process of the YOLOv5 deep learning model for object detection tasks, but it does not give specific details about the steps taken to deploy the trained model after training.
