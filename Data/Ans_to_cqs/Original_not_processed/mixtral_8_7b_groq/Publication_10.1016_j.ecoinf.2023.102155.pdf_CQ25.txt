Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating that a deep learning model was developed or implemented in the study. The text focuses on the extension of existing tools to accommodate for practical model considerations, such as bias correction and lasso-type penalties, in the context of ecological informatics.

Several functions and packages are mentioned, such as ppmlasso, ppmlassoMixEngine, and ppmlassoLoopEngine, which are used for modeling and simulation purposes. However, these functions and packages do not necessarily involve deep learning techniques.

The goal of the study is to compare the performance of new algorithms based on mixture modeling and machine learning techniques to a simple approach of fitting individual PPMs (Preference Polling Models) to the points with known species labels only, while incorporating lasso penalization and bias correction. The study aims to test the performance of these algorithms in the context of low species abundance and the presence of preferential sampling.

Therefore, the purpose of a deep learning model is not explicitly stated or described in the provided context.
