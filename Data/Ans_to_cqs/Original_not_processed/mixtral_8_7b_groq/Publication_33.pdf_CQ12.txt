Answer:::

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is mentioned in the first sentence of the context, which states that "building the convolutional neural network" is being discussed. CNNs are a type of deep learning algorithm that are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks, as they are able to automatically learn and extract features from images. This is achieved through the use of convolutional layers, which apply a series of filters to the input image in order to extract relevant features. These features are then passed through fully connected layers in order to make a classification decision. The use of CNNs for species identification is further supported by the mention of training a classification model on a given database T0, which is a common step in the training of a CNN for image classification.
