Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipelines are not mentioned. The sources discuss various applications of deep learning in predicting air quality, assessing air pollution, and evaluating the impact of air pollutants on health. However, they do not specify the use of standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

In the paper "Predicting air quality with deep learning LSTM: Towards comprehensive models" by Navares and Aznarte (2020), the authors developed a deep learning model using air quality data from the Spanish Agency of Meteorology (AEMET) and the State Meteorological Agency of Andalusia (AEMA). The dataset includes hourly measurements of pollutant concentrations, meteorological variables, and temporal features.

The paper "Air pollution in central European capital (Budapest) via self-made passive samplers and sentinel-3b SYN satellite images" by Neckel et al. (2023) utilizes self-made passive samplers and Sentinel-3b SYN satellite images to collect air pollution data. The dataset consists of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), particulate matter (PM), and ozone (O3) measurements, along with satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) and atmospheric composition data.

In the study "Assessing nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels as a contributing factor to coronavirus (COVID-19) fatality" by Ogen (2020), the author used NO2 data from the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the COVID-19 death data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).

The paper "Fly ash depositsâ€”a potential sink for carbon sequestration" by Pandey (2020) focuses on fly ash deposits and their potential for carbon sequestration. The dataset includes chemical and physical properties of fly ash samples collected from various sources.

The study "Spatio-temporal learning in predicting ambient particulate matter concentration by multi-layer perceptron" by Chianese et al. (2019) uses a dataset containing hourly measurements of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) concentrations, meteorological variables, and temporal features from multiple monitoring stations in the Campania region, Italy.

In summary, the provided context discusses various datasets specific to air quality, air pollution, and health impact assessments. However, it does not mention the use of standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
