Based on the given pieces of context, the specific deep learning model used in the Wang et al. (2023) study is not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used to enhance fusion methods for improved NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) reconstruction. NDVI is a valuable indicator of vegetation health and coverage, and its accurate reconstruction is crucial for long-term vegetation cover studies.

Deep learning models have been successfully applied to various remote sensing tasks, including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Considering the context of the Wang et al. (2023) study, the deep learning model might be used for one or more of the following purposes:

1. Image Classification: Deep learning models can be employed to classify NDVI images into different land cover classes, such as forests, grasslands, croplands, or urban areas. Accurate classification can help improve NDVI reconstruction and vegetation cover analysis.
2. Image Denoising and Restoration: Deep learning models can be used to remove noise and artifacts from NDVI images, leading to improved image quality and more accurate NDVI reconstruction.
3. Time Series Analysis and Prediction: Deep learning models can be applied to analyze NDVI time series data, identifying patterns and trends that can be used for more accurate NDVI reconstruction and prediction.
4. Fusion of Multimodal Data: Deep learning models can be used to fuse data from different sources, such as optical and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images, to generate more accurate NDVI images.

While the specific deep learning model used in the Wang et al. (2023) study is not mentioned, the study by Bermudez et al. (2018) uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for SAR to optical image synthesis for cloud removal. GANs are a type of deep learning model that can be used for image-to-image translation tasks, such as converting SAR images to optical images. In the context of the Wang et al. (2023) study, GANs could potentially be used for fusing multimodal data or denoising NDVI images.

In summary, the deep learning model used in the Wang et al. (2023) study is likely employed for enhancing NDVI reconstruction through image classification, denoising, time series analysis, or fusion of multimodal data. However, the specific deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
