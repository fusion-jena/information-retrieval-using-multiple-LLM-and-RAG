Answer:::

I am unable to provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline because it is not mentioned in the provided context. The context includes several research papers and articles about machine learning, pattern recognition, and satellite image processing. However, none of them contain information about a specific deep learning pipeline or its code repository. I can provide you with an overview of the mentioned neural network (NN) models and their applications.

Neural networks (NN) are machine learning models that excel in tasks such as classification and regression. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) arranged in layers, processing and transforming input data to produce desired outputs. NN design includes an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The number of neurons in the input layer matches the input features' count, while the output layer corresponds to the number of outputs or classes.

In the provided context, several studies use neural networks for various applications:

1. Bishop (2006) discusses pattern recognition and machine learning using NNs.
2. Burges (1998) presents a tutorial on support vector machines for pattern recognition.
3. Brockmann et al. (2016) describe the evolution of the C2RCC neural network for Sentinel 2 and 3 ocean color products.
4. Hanintyo et al. (2021) focus on chlorophyll-a and total suspended matter retrieval using C2RCC neural network algorithms on Landsat 8 data.
5. Noori et al. (2023) introduce a machine learning model trained by time-series satellite imagery for lake total suspended matter retrieval by wind speed.

While these studies use neural networks, the context does not provide a code repository link for any of the mentioned deep learning pipelines.
