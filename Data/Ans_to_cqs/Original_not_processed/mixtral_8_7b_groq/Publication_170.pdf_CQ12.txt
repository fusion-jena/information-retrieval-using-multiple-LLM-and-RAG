Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the DCNN model of the study is the AlexNet model, which includes five convolutional layers and three fully connected layers. The first, second, and fifth convolutional layers perform a downsampling operation using the mean pooling method. Additionally, except for the last fully connected layer, each layer performs Local Response Normalization (LRN) processing and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function processing. This information is provided in the context in the description of the DCNN model used in the study.
