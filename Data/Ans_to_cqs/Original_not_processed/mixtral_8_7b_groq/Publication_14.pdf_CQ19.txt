Answer:::
The deep learning model was built using the TensorFlow framework. This information is provided in the reference "Abadi, M., Barham, P., Chen, J., Chen, Z., Davis, A., Dean, J., â€¦ Kudlur, M. (2016). TensorFlow: A system for large- scale machine learning." The authors of the study acknowledge the support of Google engineers, which suggests the use of TensorFlow, as it is a popular open-source machine learning framework developed by Google Brain. Furthermore, the ORCID profile (http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2176-7935) of the study's author is associated with the Google Brain team, which strengthens the assumption of TensorFlow usage.
