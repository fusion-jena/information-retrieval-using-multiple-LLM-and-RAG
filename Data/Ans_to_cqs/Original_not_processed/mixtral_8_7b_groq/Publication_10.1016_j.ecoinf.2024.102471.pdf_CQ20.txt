The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the Wav2Vec model. However, it is common practice to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to train deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which significantly speeds up the training process compared to using a Central Processing Unit (CPU) alone. Therefore, it is likely that GPUs or TPUs were used for training the Wav2Vec model, but this information is not explicitly stated in the context.
