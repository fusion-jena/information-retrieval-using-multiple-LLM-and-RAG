The provided context discusses specific preprocessing steps applied to a particular problem of counting whiteflies in images of sticky traps. However, it does not directly mention general preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.

Nonetheless, I can give a general overview of common preprocessing steps before training a deep learning model:

1. **Data cleaning**: This involves removing irrelevant or corrupted data points that can negatively impact the model's performance. In the given context, the authors mention removing contaminants from the images, which can be considered a data cleaning step.

2. **Data normalization**: This process scales the data to a common range, often between 0 and 1, to ensure that all features contribute equally to the learning process. This is particularly important when features have different units or scales.

3. **Data augmentation**: This technique generates new data points by applying transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping, or cropping) to the existing data. It helps increase the size and diversity of the training set, reducing overfitting and improving generalization. In the given context, the authors use data augmentation by flipping the patches horizontally and vertically during the training phase.

4. **Data scaling**: This is similar to normalization but focuses on adjusting the range of features to improve model convergence or stability. Common methods include standardization (centering data and scaling to unit variance) or robust scaling (scaling to the interquartile range).

5. **Feature extraction**: This step involves deriving meaningful features from raw data. In the given context, the authors generate bounding boxes, density maps, and segmentation maps from dot labels as features for their deep learning models.

It is essential to note that the specific preprocessing steps depend on the problem, dataset, and deep learning model being used. Thus, it is always recommended to explore and experiment with different preprocessing techniques to find the best approach for each problem.
