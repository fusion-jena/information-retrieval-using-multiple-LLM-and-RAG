Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The sources cited focus on the methodology, results, and applications of UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for species distribution modeling, as well as related topics such as remote sensing imagery, convolutional neural networks, and bioclimatic variables. However, they do not mention where the code for the deep learning pipeline can be found.

It is possible that the authors have not made the code publicly available, or it could be hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. If you are interested in the code, I would recommend reaching out to the authors directly to inquire about its availability.
