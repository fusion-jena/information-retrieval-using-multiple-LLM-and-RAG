Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline of GreenCam. The text focuses on the details of the model used for photo Green Vision Integrity (GVI) measurement, SegFormer, and the training process. It explains the encoder-decoder structure of SegFormer, the choice of MiT-B1 as the encoder, and the training datasets used. However, it does not mention where the code for this deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
