Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when the training of the deep learning models is complete. However, it can be inferred that the training process involved the use of the grid search tool in scikit-learn for training and optimizing the Logistic Regression (LR) models on the validation set.

In the context, the evaluation metrics used for the ResNet architectures include macro-F1, top-1 accuracy, and micro-F1 for both the validation and test sets. It can be assumed that the training of the models was evaluated based on these metrics, and the training was likely stopped when there was no significant improvement in the validation set's performance metrics.

Furthermore, the Selection with Guaranteed Risk (SGR) algorithm was applied at different risk levels ranging from 5% to 30% on the validation set for training. The train-risk, train-coverage, test-risk, test-coverage, and top-5 uncovered were assessed for each risk level. It can be inferred that the SGR algorithm's training was also evaluated based on these metrics, and the training was stopped when the desired risk level was achieved or when there was no significant improvement in the test set's performance metrics.

In summary, while there is no explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when the training of the deep learning models is complete, it can be inferred that the training was evaluated based on the performance metrics for the validation and test sets. The training was likely stopped when there was no significant improvement in the validation set's performance metrics or when the desired risk level was achieved for the SGR algorithm.
