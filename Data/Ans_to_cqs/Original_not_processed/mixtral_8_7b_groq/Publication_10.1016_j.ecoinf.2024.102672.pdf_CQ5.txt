Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the application of data-driven models, including machine learning and deep learning, to freshwater ecosystems, specifically for predicting algal blooms and water temperature. However, it does not mention any standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet that are commonly used in deep learning research.

The data used in this study were related to meteorological conditions and water temperature, sourced from the CHE, SAICA, and SAIH. The data were pre-processed to ensure quality, and lagged variables were added to improve the model's performance. The specific details of these datasets, such as their size, format, and collection methods, are not provided in the context.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
