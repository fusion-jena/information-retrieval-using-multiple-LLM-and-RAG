The provided context discusses the use of statistical analysis, specifically the random forest classification technique, and data preprocessing for seagrass species identification. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.

In general, techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria, then ensuring that each subgroup is proportionally represented in both the training and validation sets. This helps to prevent bias that may arise from uneven distribution of classes.

2. Oversampling: In cases where one class is underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from that class. This can help to balance the dataset and prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

3. Undersampling: Conversely, if one class is overrepresented in the dataset, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of instances from that class. This can also help to balance the dataset and prevent bias.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that it is representative of the target population can help to reduce bias in the dataset. This includes considering factors such as geographical location, demographics, and environmental conditions.

While the provided context does not mention these specific techniques, it does discuss the importance of data preprocessing for seagrass species identification. The authors describe the process of removing non-vegetated and mixed pixels from the dataset to reduce the effects of non-vegetated and mixed pixels. This can be seen as a form of data preprocessing aimed at improving the quality of the dataset and reducing bias.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, it is an important consideration in any machine learning project. Techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can help to reduce bias and improve the performance of the model.
