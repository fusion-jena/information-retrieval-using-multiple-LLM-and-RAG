The provided context does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during the pre-processing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some strategies related to data handling and image processing that could be relevant in the context of deep learning.

In the pre-processing of imagery, one important consideration is scale sensitivity, which implies that the conclusions drawn from the data can be heavily influenced by the scale used. To address this, the text suggests using multiple scales and comparing the results with other datasets to check for spurious scale-dependent relationships. This can help ensure that the findings are not an artifact of a particular scale and increase the generalizability of the results.

In the context of segmentation and classification, the text mentions that segmentation and classification strategies are still rapidly evolving, and methods for automatically selecting segmentation parameters are under development. Better classifications may be possible as these tools develop further. The text also mentions that machine learning techniques are being brought together with segmentation to more automatically classify images. These techniques could potentially be used to address data bias by oversampling or undersampling certain classes to balance the dataset.

The text also emphasizes the importance of supervision and validation using aerial photo interpretation techniques or other data sources, even with machine learning. This can help ensure that the model is not learning biased patterns in the data and increase the reliability of the results.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during the pre-processing of a deep learning pipeline, it does mention some strategies related to data handling and image processing that could be relevant. These include using multiple scales, comparing the results with other datasets, developing better classification methods, using machine learning techniques for automatic classification, and supervision and validation using other data sources.
