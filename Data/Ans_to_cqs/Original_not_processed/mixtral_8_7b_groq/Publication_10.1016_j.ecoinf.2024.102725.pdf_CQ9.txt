Answer:::

The data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. Common data repositories include Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF, but there is no information indicating that the data was shared in any of these platforms.

The study does mention that the MCD43A4 V6.1 data for satellite path h27v06 was obtained from the Google Earth Engine platform and spans from October 29, 2022, to December 20, 2022. The data access link is provided: <https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MODIS_061_MCD43A4>, accessed on May 1, 2023. However, this link leads to the general documentation of the dataset and not to the specific data used in the study.

It is important to note that data sharing and reproducibility are essential aspects of scientific research. If the data repository is not specified in the paper, it is recommended to contact the authors directly to request access to the data or additional information about the deep learning pipeline.
