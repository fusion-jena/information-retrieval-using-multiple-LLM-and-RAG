The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be computationally intensive, indicating the need for powerful hardware. ANNs have been employed in various applications, including speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, and freshwater ecology, all of which require significant computational power.

Moreover, the context discusses hyperparameter tuning using a randomized grid search, which is a technique that can help optimize the performance of machine learning models. This process can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, implying the use of high-end computational resources. However, the specific type of hardware, such as GPUs or TPUs, is not mentioned.

Therefore, while it is clear that substantial computational resources are needed for training deep learning models and hyperparameter tuning, the context does not provide enough information to specifically answer the query about the use of GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources.
