Answer:::

The provided pieces of context do not contain information about the use of deep learning models, nor do they mention any frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The keywords and topics of the articles focus on ecological informatics, species distribution modeling, machine learning, and multi-scale analysis. While the authors discuss the application of machine learning techniques like random forests and generalized linear models, there is no mention of deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given context.
