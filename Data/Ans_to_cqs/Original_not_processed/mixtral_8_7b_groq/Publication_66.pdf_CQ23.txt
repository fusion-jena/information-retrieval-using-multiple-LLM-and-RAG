Answer:::

The text provided does not give explicit details about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the models were validated using withheld data, which implies some form of cross-validation or a hold-out method was used. 

The researchers trained their models on GPS track data from European shags, common guillemots, and razorbills. The use of multiple species can be seen as a form of diversity in the dataset, which could help improve the model's generalizability. 

Moreover, the researchers explored different combinations of variables to train the models, which could also contribute to the model's generalizability. They found that the optimum models for all species predicted non-diving and diving behavior correctly over 94% and 80% of the time, respectively. This suggests that the models have a good fit and could potentially generalize well to unseen data.

However, without explicit mention of techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other methods to assess and ensure generalizability, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer based on the provided context.
