Answer:::
The text provided does not give explicit information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that Python and the fastai library were used for developing the deep learning CNN, but it does not specify which optimization techniques were applied. Common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop, but without further information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
