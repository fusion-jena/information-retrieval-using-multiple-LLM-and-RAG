Answer:::
I'm sorry, but the provided context does not contain information about the frameworks used to build a deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context discusses the "covsel" R package, which is used for embedded covariate selection in species distribution modeling. The package includes functions for collinearity filtering and model-specific embedding, but it does not mention any deep learning frameworks.

The context does mention various inputs and arguments for the functions in the "covsel" package, such as species presence/absence data, covariate data, and correlation coefficient thresholds. However, it does not provide information about the specific machine learning or deep learning algorithms used in the package.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context. I hope this helps!
