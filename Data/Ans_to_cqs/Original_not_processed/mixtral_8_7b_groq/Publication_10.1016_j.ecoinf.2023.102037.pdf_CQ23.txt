The generalizability of a deep learning model refers to its ability to perform well on new, unseen data. To ensure the generalizability of their model, the researchers took several measures.

Firstly, they used a diverse dataset. The dataset consisted of sticky plate images, which are commonly used in ecological research to capture and study insects. By using a dataset of sticky plate images, the model was exposed to a wide variety of insects, lighting conditions, and backgrounds. This helped to ensure that the model would be able to handle new, unseen insects and environments.

Secondly, the researchers split the data on the sticky plate level. This means that individual insects that belonged to the same sticky plate image were kept together in the same dataset (training, validation, or testing). This allowed the model to be validated in a practice-oriented way, as it emulated the way in which the model would be used in practice. Namely, it predicted a class for any given object it detected on unseen sticky plate images – data it never saw during training.

Thirdly, the researchers used a specific validation procedure called "Slicing Aided Hyper Inference" (SAHI) to evaluate the model's performance. This procedure involves applying the YOLOv5 model on a sticky plate image and tiling sticky plate images by finding regions of interest of a fixed size (512x512 pixels) that contain the maximum number of complete bounding boxes. This helped to ensure that the model was able to accurately detect and classify insects of various sizes and orientations within the sticky plate images.

Lastly, the researchers took into consideration the limitations of weak validation procedures, such as random data splitting. They noted that other studies had only focused on datasets where insect classes were quite broad – insect order or family level, quite dissimilar and thus, relatively easy to classify. To avoid this, the researchers used a more rigorous validation procedure, which helped to ensure the generalizability of the model.

In summary, the researchers ensured the generalizability of their deep learning model by using a diverse dataset, splitting the data on the sticky plate level, using the SAHI validation procedure, and taking into consideration the limitations of weak validation procedures.
