Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of a network based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) modules, as well as a CA-Hybrid network that integrates the Class Activation Mapping (CAM) into the residual structure of ResNet.

The context highlights the improvements in classification accuracy achieved by the proposed model and the CA-Hybrid network, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used during the training of these models. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this question without additional information.
