Answer:::
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the description of the deep learning model, its architecture, and its performance in identifying medicinal plants from similar poisonous plants. The model is built upon the ResNeSt structure, which is a ResNet variant with a channel-wise attention mechanism. The model also employs split attention to focus on both the position and importance of the most significant features. The performance of the model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score, and it outperforms other state-of-the-art models. However, the context does not mention the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested information.
