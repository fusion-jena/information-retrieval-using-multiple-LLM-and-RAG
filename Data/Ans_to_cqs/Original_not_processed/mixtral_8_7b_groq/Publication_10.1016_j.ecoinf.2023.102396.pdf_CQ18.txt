Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses various reports and studies related to wildlife management areas (WMAs) in Mississippi and some statistical methods used in ecology, but it does not mention any specific techniques for model performance monitoring during training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query. However, it is important to note that monitoring model performance during training is a crucial step in machine learning and statistical modeling to ensure the model's validity and reliability. Common strategies for monitoring model performance during training include using validation sets, cross-validation, and various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
