Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the model is evaluated using the Area Under Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve. This metric is used to validate the species probability distribution model in a threshold-independent assessment, which characterizes the model performance at various discrimination thresholds. The primary application of the ROC curve is found in raster-based studies focusing on predicting land use and land cover, species distribution modeling, risk assessment, and other probability mappings.

In the context, the AUC value is used to compare the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and a BIOCLIM model for predicting the occurrence scenarios of a species. The CNN model outperformed the BIOCLIM model, with an AUC value of 0.917 compared to 0.68, respectively.

It can be assumed that the AUC value was calculated during the training process to monitor the model's performance and adjust the model's parameters accordingly. However, the specific strategy or techniques used to monitor the model performance during training, such as cross-validation, early stopping, or learning rate scheduling, are not provided in the context.
