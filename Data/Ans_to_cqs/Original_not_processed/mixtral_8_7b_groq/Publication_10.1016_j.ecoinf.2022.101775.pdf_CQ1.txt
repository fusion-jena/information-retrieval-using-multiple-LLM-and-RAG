Answer:::

The provided pieces of context do not directly answer the query regarding the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention the use of sensors and public datasets in specific studies.

In the Shah and Mishra (2020) study, an IoT-enabled low power environment monitoring system was used for prediction of PM2.5. This implies the use of sensors to collect data. Similarly, in the Xie et al. (2017) study, the authors discussed recovering corrupted data in sensor networks, indicating the use of sensors for data collection.

In addition, the Sharma et al. (2020) study used a public dataset for sentimental short sentences classification. Public datasets are often used in deep learning as they provide a large amount of data that can be used for training models.

Furthermore, the Blondel et al. (2011b) study on scikit-learn, a machine learning library in Python, and the Piech et al. (2015) study on deep knowledge tracing, do not explicitly mention the data collection methods but they do use existing datasets for their research.

In summary, while the provided context does not give a comprehensive answer to the query, it does suggest the use of sensors and public datasets for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
