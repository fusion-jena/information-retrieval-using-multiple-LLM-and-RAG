Based on the provided context, there is no information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning models. The context includes several papers that discuss various deep learning techniques for tasks such as object detection, semantic frameworks for smart farming, and insect classification. However, none of the papers mention the specific platform used for deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
