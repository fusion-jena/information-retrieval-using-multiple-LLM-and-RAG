Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The study focuses on the classification of land cover in the Kruger National Park (KNP) using a supervised learning workflow with high spatial resolution aerial images from 1939-1944 and a Random Forest algorithm. The results of this study are intended to be used as a baseline for future land use and land cover (LULC) analysis, including deep learning methods. However, the specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline is not mentioned.

The study does mention several resources related to the data and methods used, including the CRediT authorship contribution statement for a study on Landsat 8 data classification in Google Earth Engine using Random Forest, a study on the influence of aridity on vegetation, the Global Land Outlook report from the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, a study on woody cover mapping in the savanna ecosystem of the Kruger National Park using Sentinel-1 C-band time series data, and a study on challenges in using land use and land cover data for global change studies. However, none of these resources provide information on the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as the necessary information is not available in the provided context.
