Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is stated that a K-fold cross-validation technique and random under-sampling (RUS) were used during the validation phase of the machine learning algorithms.

Data augmentation is a strategy used to increase the diversity of training data by applying various transformations to the existing data. This can include techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling images in a computer vision task. The primary goal is to improve the model's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data.

In the context of the text, the authors used Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3.5 and 4 (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) to enhance the language quality and fluency of the English content. They also prepared a dataset and used a four-fold cross-validation technique during the validation phase. However, they did not explicitly mention data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer regarding the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
