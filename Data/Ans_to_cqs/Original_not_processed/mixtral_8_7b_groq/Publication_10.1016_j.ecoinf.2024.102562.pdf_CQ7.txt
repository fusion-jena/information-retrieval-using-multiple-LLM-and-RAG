Based on the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated. However, we can infer that the dataset was divided into a training set and a validation set for the final evaluation of the model.

Before the final evaluation, the model was partially trained and then used for self-annotation to create a new dataset, which was subsequently manually checked and edited by a human. This new dataset contained 540 training images and 141 validation images. It is likely that these images were used as the final training and validation sets for the deep learning model.

Furthermore, a separate small dataset was used to fine-tune the model for the Kenyan data, which had lower image quality compared to the other two sampling locations. This suggests that the data was split based on the image quality and experimental conditions to ensure the model's versatility and accuracy in capturing and quantifying bacterial abundance and morphology differences.

In summary, while the explicit criteria for splitting the data are not provided, it can be inferred that the dataset was divided into a training set and a validation set, and a separate small dataset was used for fine-tuning the model for specific image quality and experimental conditions.
