Answer:::

The text provided does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of a specific deep learning method, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification.

In the context of deep learning, randomness can be introduced in various ways, such as through the initialization of weights and biases, the order of training samples, and the use of dropout regularization. These sources of randomness can help to improve the generalization ability of deep learning models by preventing overfitting and encouraging exploration of the solution space.

One common way to control randomness in deep learning is by setting a fixed random seed value. This ensures that the same sequence of random numbers is generated every time the model is trained, making the training process reproducible. However, the text provided does not mention whether or how a random seed value was used in the deep learning pipeline for HSI classification.

In the context of HSI classification, the text mentions the use of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D-CNN) that includes a convolution operation, a pooling operation, and a fully connected operation. The structure of this 1-D-CNN is kept simple due to the insufficient training data. The text also mentions that this 1-D-CNN achieved a satisfactory classification performance. However, it does not provide details on how randomness was handled in the training of this 1-D-CNN.

Therefore, while the text provides useful information on the use of deep learning for HSI classification, it does not directly address the query about strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
