Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the deep learning model, its performance metrics, or its application in the context of forest biomass density evaluation. The sources mainly focus on forest biomass density estimation, spatial distribution, and temporal changes in forest biomass, primarily using statistical analysis and GIS techniques.

However, when evaluating a deep learning model for a task like forest biomass density estimation, common performance metrics include:

1. Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions.
2. Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions (correctly classified biomass density) among all positive predictions.
3. Recall (Sensitivity): The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances (real biomass density values).
4. F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced assessment of both.
5. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
6. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): The square root of the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.
7. RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination): A statistical measure indicating the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

These metrics can help assess the performance of a deep learning model in estimating forest biomass density. However, the provided context does not contain specific details about the deep learning model or its evaluation, so a definitive answer cannot be given based on the available information.
