The provided context does not directly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data and remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation in forestry. In the context of LiDAR data, a common annotation technique is point cloud annotation, where each LiDAR return point is labeled with relevant information such as tree species, height, and diameter at breast height (DBH). This annotated data can then be used to train deep learning models for tasks such as individual tree detection and biomass estimation.

In the context of remote sensing imagery, object-based image analysis (OBIA) is a common annotation technique. OBIA involves segmenting the image into objects or regions, and then labeling each object with relevant information such as land cover type or vegetation density. These labeled objects can be used to train deep learning models for tasks such as land cover classification or biomass estimation.

Another annotation technique that could be used in the deep learning pipeline for biomass estimation is semantic segmentation, where each pixel in the image is labeled with a specific class. This technique can provide more detailed information compared to object-based image analysis, but it also requires more annotated data and computational resources.

It's worth noting that the quality of the annotated data is crucial for constructing accurate and reliable deep learning models. Therefore, it's important to use high-quality annotated data and follow best practices for data annotation, such as using multiple annotators and performing quality control checks.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for biomass estimation, it does discuss the use of LiDAR data and remote sensing imagery for this task. Common annotation techniques for LiDAR data include point cloud annotation, while for remote sensing imagery, object-based image analysis and semantic segmentation are commonly used. The quality of the annotated data is crucial for constructing accurate and reliable deep learning models.
