Answer:::

Based on the information provided, there are no specific details about post-processing steps involved immediately after the model training. However, it is common to calculate various metrics and evaluate the model's performance using a confusion matrix or saliency maps.

After training a classifier, some of the typical post-processing steps include:

1. Metrics calculation: This involves determining various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess the model's performance. These metrics can be calculated based on the confusion matrix.

2. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It summarizes the number of false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives. From the confusion matrix, you can calculate various metrics mentioned above.

3. Saliency maps: Saliency maps are a way to visualize the important features that a model has learned. They highlight the parts of the input that the model considers most relevant for its prediction. While the context does not specifically mention saliency maps, they can be a helpful tool in post-processing to understand the model's decision-making process.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: Although not explicitly mentioned as a post-processing step, hyperparameter tuning is an essential step in the machine learning workflow. It involves adjusting parameters such as learning rate, batch size, or regularization techniques to optimize the model's performance.

It is important to note that the context provided focuses on model training, comparison of different classifiers, and hyperparameter tuning. Post-processing steps might have been performed but are not detailed in the text.
