Answer:::
The provided context does not mention a code repository for a deep learning pipeline, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The model discussed in the context is built upon the Monte Carlo method for classification purposes. The computational cost and need for a sufficient number of trials are emphasized throughout the text.

The model's application to a real wildfire case in Vall de Gallinera, Spain, is demonstrated, but there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository.

Therefore, based on the given context, the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is not available. If deep learning is indeed used in this study, the text does not provide information on where the code repository is located.

Answering the query accurately requires more context or information about the deep learning pipeline and its code repository.
