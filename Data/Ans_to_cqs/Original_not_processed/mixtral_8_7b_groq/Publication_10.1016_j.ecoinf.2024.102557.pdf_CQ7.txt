Answer:::

The provided context does not contain specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context focuses on model hyperparameter tuning for species-specific models using Bayesian optimization and environmental cross-validation with ten folds. It also discusses the use of machine learning techniques in ecology, including deep learning, and their applications in various domains. However, it does not mention the data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

In general, data splitting for deep learning model training involves dividing the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

The specific criteria used to split the data can vary depending on the problem and the dataset's size. Common approaches include random sampling, stratified sampling, and time-series splitting. Random sampling involves randomly selecting a portion of the data for each subset, while stratified sampling ensures that each subset has a similar distribution of classes or labels. Time-series splitting is used for time-series data, where the data is split based on time intervals.

Therefore, while the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it is a crucial step in the model development process to ensure the model's generalization and performance evaluation.
