Answer:::

In the context provided, the training of a deep neural network (DNN) is determined to be complete when the accuracy of the network on the test dataset does not increase further. This is a common approach in machine learning, where the goal is to create a model that generalizes well to new, unseen data. By monitoring the network's performance on the test dataset during training, it is possible to identify when the network has learned as much as it can from the training data and prevent overfitting.

In other words, the training process is stopped when there is a plateau in the validation loss, which is the loss function calculated on the test dataset. This plateau indicates that the network's parameters have stabilized and that additional training is unlikely to improve the network's performance.

It is worth noting that the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete can vary depending on the problem and the dataset. For example, some practitioners may choose to use a combination of metrics, such as both accuracy and loss, to make a more informed decision about when to stop training. Additionally, other techniques such as early stopping or using a separate validation dataset can also be used to prevent overfitting and determine when training is complete.

In the context provided, the authors also mention that they evaluated the network performance by calculating a number of different performance measures based on comparing predictions to test set data. These measures include precision, recall, and the F1 Score, as well as Conditional Kappa and the True Skill Statistic. These metrics can provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the network's performance, especially when the class distribution is unbalanced, as in this case.

In summary, the training of a DNN is determined to be complete when the accuracy of the network on the test dataset does not increase further, indicating a plateau in the validation loss. This is a common approach to prevent overfitting and ensure that the network generalizes well to new data. Other performance measures can also be used to evaluate the network's performance.
