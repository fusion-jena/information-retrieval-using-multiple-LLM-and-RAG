Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, some related concepts are discussed, such as the use of batch normalization (BN) layers and the optimization of model performance.

Batch normalization layers are commonly used in deep learning models to accelerate network convergence, prevent overfitting, and solve issues related to gradient disappearance and explosion. These layers normalize the inputs of each batch, introducing randomness during the training process. Although BN layers play an active role in the training process, they add additional operations during the forward inference, affecting the performance of the model and occupying more memory or memory space. To address this issue, the BN layer parameters can be merged into a convolution layer to improve the forward inference speed of the model.

In addition, the text highlights the importance of balancing speed and accuracy in deep learning models, particularly in the context of bird voice recognition for conservation purposes. This balance can be achieved through careful algorithm optimization and structural design, ensuring good performance while reducing computational complexity and deployment costs.

While not directly addressing the query, these concepts provide some insight into how randomness can be managed in deep learning pipelines. The use of BN layers, for example, introduces a form of controlled randomness during training, which can help improve model performance and generalization. Furthermore, the optimization of model performance, including the reduction of computational complexity and memory usage, can be seen as an indirect strategy for handling randomness, as it ensures the model's stability and reliability across different runs and hardware configurations.
