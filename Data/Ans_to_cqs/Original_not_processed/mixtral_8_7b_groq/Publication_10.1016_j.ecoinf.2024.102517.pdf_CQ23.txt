Answer:

The text provided does not give explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some implications that suggest that the researchers may have taken steps to ensure the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

Firstly, the researchers used a diverse set of bioacoustics noise reduction algorithms for comparison, including SEGAN, WebRTC, wavelet transform, Wiener filter, and MMSE STSA algorithms. This suggests that they may have considered a variety of noise types and signal characteristics in the development and testing of their model.

Secondly, the model was trained on an entire training set presented in a random order, with one noisy bird sound signal per iteration. This approach, known as epoch-wise training, can help the model learn to handle a variety of input data and reduce overfitting.

Thirdly, the use of batch normalization and a leaky rectified linear unit (LReLU) as a non-linear operation may also contribute to the model's generalizability. Batch normalization can help reduce internal covariate shift, which can improve the model's performance and stability. The use of LReLU can help prevent the vanishing gradient problem, which can improve the model's ability to learn from complex data.

However, without explicit information about the dataset used, the splitting strategy, or the use of cross-validation, it is difficult to definitively say whether the researchers took specific measures to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model.
