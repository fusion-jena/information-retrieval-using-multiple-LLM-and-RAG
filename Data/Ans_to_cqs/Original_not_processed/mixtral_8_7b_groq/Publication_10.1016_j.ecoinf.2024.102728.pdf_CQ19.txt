Answer:::

The provided context does not include information on the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model in the Mohedano et al. (2017) study. The study, "Object retrieval with deep convolutional," discusses the use of deep convolutional neural networks for object retrieval but does not mention the framework used for implementation.

Common frameworks for building deep learning models include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. TensorFlow, developed by Google Brain, is a popular open-source library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. PyTorch, developed by Facebook's AI Research lab, is another widely used open-source machine learning library. Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.

Without more specific information from the study, it is not possible to determine which framework was used for building the deep learning model.
