Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on the classification of vegetation types and habitats, with details about the datasets, classes, and their distributions.

However, it is important to note that when working with deep learning models, particularly for image classification tasks like the one suggested by the context, using hardware accelerators such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) or TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) is a common practice. These hardware resources can significantly speed up the training process by parallelizing computations, which is essential for deep learning models due to their high computational demands.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, it is highly likely that GPUs or TPUs were used, considering the nature of the task and the general practices in deep learning.
