The provided context discusses the methodologies used in ecological informatics for species habitat use projection, including the use of regression-based models, machine learning techniques, and deep learning strategies. However, it does not specifically mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

In general, there are several techniques that can be used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. These include:

1. Stratified sampling: This technique involves dividing the data into different strata based on certain characteristics, such as class labels, and then randomly sampling from each stratum to ensure that the training set is representative of the overall data distribution.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class in the training set to balance it with the majority class. This can help to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class in the training set to balance it with the minority class. This can help to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources to ensure that the training set is representative of the real-world distribution of the data. This can help to prevent the model from being biased towards a particular source or distribution of data.

It is important to note that the choice of technique will depend on the specific characteristics of the data and the problem at hand. For example, if the data is highly imbalanced, oversampling or undersampling may be appropriate. If the data is biased towards a particular source, diverse data collection may be necessary.

In summary, while the provided context does not specifically mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, there are several techniques that can be used, including stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. The choice of technique will depend on the specific characteristics of the data and the problem at hand.
