Answer:::

Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The study by Kaushik et al. (Ecological Informatics 78(2023)1023543-1023545) focuses on exploring the potential of deep learning and machine learning algorithms for enhancing groundwater-climate interactions understanding in the sub-basins of the Great Artesian Basin (GAB) region. The study uses various datasets, including TWS, SMS, GWS, SPEI-3, 6, and 12, ENSO, NAO, AMO, PDO, IOD, Ni単o 1 + 2, Ni単o 3.0, Ni単o 3.4, Ni単o 4, NTA, STA, and ETA. However, the study does not specify where the data repository is hosted.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer to the query without additional information. It is recommended to contact the authors or the journal for further details regarding the data repository.
