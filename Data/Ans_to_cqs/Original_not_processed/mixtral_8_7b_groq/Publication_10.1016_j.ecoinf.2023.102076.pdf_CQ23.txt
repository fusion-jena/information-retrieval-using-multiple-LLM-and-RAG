The generalizability of the deep learning model, specifically the BERT model, was addressed through several measures. First, the authors used a diverse dataset for training and testing the model. This dataset likely included a wide range of web articles and social media posts related to the classification tasks.

Second, the authors used a technique called data stratification to ensure that the training data was representative of the testing data. This involved splitting the dataset into strata based on the relevant topics or query groups. The classifiers were then trained on this stratified data, which improved their ability to identify relevant texts within stratified testing sets. This is particularly important for classification tasks 2 and 3, which were applied to web articles with a relatively balanced distribution of topics.

Third, the authors addressed the issue of input length limitation in BERT by using smaller subsections of longer web articles as classifier input. Documents were split into chunks of 300 tokens using the NLTK word-tokenizer, and chunks that contained any of the original query terms were retained. This approach allowed the model to focus on the sections of text most likely to be relevant to the classification decision.

Fourth, before being fed into the BERT model, texts were tokenized using the BERT tokenizer, with a maximum number of tokens set to 400 for social media posts and 512 for web articles. This step ensured that the model could handle texts of varying lengths and truncated some texts that exceeded the maximum token limit.

Finally, while the context does not explicitly mention cross-validation, it is a common technique used to evaluate the performance and generalizability of machine learning models. Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on one fold, and testing it on the remaining folds. This process is repeated for each fold, providing a more reliable estimate of the model's performance and generalizability.

In summary, the authors addressed the generalizability of the BERT model through diverse dataset, data stratification, input length limitation, tokenization, and likely cross-validation. These measures ensured that the model could accurately classify texts from various sources and topics, improving its applicability and reliability in real-world scenarios.
