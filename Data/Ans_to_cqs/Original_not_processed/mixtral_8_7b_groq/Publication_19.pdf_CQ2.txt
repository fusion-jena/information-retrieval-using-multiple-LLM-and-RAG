Answer:
The research in question uses images as the data format in its deep learning pipeline. This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of camera traps to capture images of animals. These images are then used to train deep learning models for the purpose of automatic image classification and species identification.

Moreover, the keywords listed in the abstract include "animal classification," "camera trap," and "wildlife monitoring," which further support the use of image data in this research. The hyperparameters table also specifies the input image size for each of the deep learning models used in the study, providing further evidence of the use of image data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline of this research is image data.
