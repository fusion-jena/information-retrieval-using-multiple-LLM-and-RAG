Based on the provided context, there is no information about data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the creation of a three-layer backpropagation artificial neural network using MATLAB R2014b for predicting total suspended solids (TSI) based on aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) data. The network consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer, with 64 water samples used for model calibration and the remaining samples for validation. The evaluation of the model's performance is done by calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI values. However, there is no mention of data augmentation techniques.
