Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning model mentioned in the context is for image classification. This model is used to identify and classify images of red kites, a specific bird species, based on an independent test set of 2060 images. The training data for this model was generated from citizen science data documenting and recording sightings of birds, with 950 of the images in the test set being true positive red kite images.

The model was trained using a workflow that takes advantage of both textual metadata and image content to identify relevant sightings in a social media dataset. The training process involved 448 epochs, with a batch size of 64, and an ADAM optimizer with a learning rate of 10. Image augmentation techniques such as horizontal flip, random zoom, and counter-clockwise shear were applied to increase the diversity of the training data. The best model was selected based on minimal validation loss, and it showed a training loss of 0.256, a training accuracy of 0.899, a validation loss of 0.298, and a validation accuracy of 0.891.

The input tensors for the model were 224 Ã— 244 pixel RGB images, which were normalized to ImageNet mean values and rescaled in the range of [0, 1]. The model training took roughly 4 days to complete. Overall, this deep learning model is designed to classify images of red kites with high accuracy, utilizing both image content and associated metadata to improve its performance.
