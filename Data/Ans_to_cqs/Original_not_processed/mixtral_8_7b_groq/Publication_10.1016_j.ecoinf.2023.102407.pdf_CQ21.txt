Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are no specific details mentioned about postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix after the model training. However, it does mention the calculation of evaluation metrics, particularly AUC (Area Under the Curve) and TSS (True Skill Statistic).

In the study, several SDMs (Species Distribution Models) including GLM, GAM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, XGB, LGBM, ANN, and SDP-EPL were trained and compared. The training settings and hyperparameters for each SDM were set up as per Bean et al. (2012) for the study area and MaxEnt. 

For the SDP-EPL model, an ensemble teacher model was constructed by grouping ANN, RF, GBM, XGB, and LGBM models. A student model using ANNs was trained for up to 400 epochs, incrementally generating pseudo-labeled presence and absence data using the teacher model every 100 epochs. The number of data points added in each PL iteration was determined carefully to ensure the accuracy of SDP-EPL, and K = 200 performed optimally for most cases in their study.

Once the models were trained, the evaluation metrics AUC and TSS were calculated for objective comparison of the performances of the SDMs. Table 5 summarizes the evaluation criteria for these metrics. However, there is no explicit mention of other postprocessing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrix.

Answer:::

In summary, based on the given context, the postprocessing steps involve the calculation of evaluation metrics AUC and TSS for comparing the performance of different SDMs. There is no explicit mention of other postprocessing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrix.
