Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text focuses on the methodology and process of developing a classification algorithm for identifying individual Amur tigers using their footprints.

However, it can be inferred that computational resources, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), were likely used for training the deep learning model, given the complexity of the task and the need for high-performance computing to process and analyze large amounts of image data. These types of hardware are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning applications to accelerate the training process and improve model performance.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, it is reasonable to assume that high-performance computing hardware, such as GPUs or TPUs, were utilized given the nature of the task and the typical use of such resources in deep learning applications.
