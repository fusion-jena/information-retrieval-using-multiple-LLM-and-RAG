Answer:::
The performance of the deep learning model was evaluated using several metrics, although the specific values for these metrics were not provided in the context. The metrics used include DBCV (Davies-Bouldin Calinski-Harabasz Validation) score, ARI (Adjusted Rand Index), and AMI (Adjusted Mutual Information). These metrics are used to evaluate the quality of clustering based on the latent space representations extracted from the backbone of the model. The DBCV score is used to determine the optimal CNN backbone for fine-tuning the model without knowledge of the ground truth labels. The ARI and AMI scores are used to compare the similarity between the predicted clusters and the ground truth clusters. However, the context does not mention any metric related to accuracy, precision, or recall, which are commonly used metrics for evaluating the performance of deep learning models in classification tasks.
