Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. The mentioned studies use various methods such as linear regression, artificial neural network-based cellular automata, airborne Lidar bathymetry, multiband satellite imagery, and regression tree models for predicting wetland area, depth, and coastal water bathymetry. However, none of them explicitly mention the use of a deep learning pipeline, nor do they specify a code repository for such a pipeline.

An example of a study that uses deep learning for a similar task is the one by Kutser et al. (2020), which is mentioned in the context. This study uses a deep learning model for shallow water remote sensing. However, the context does not provide a code repository for this study either.

Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information as it is not present in the given context.
