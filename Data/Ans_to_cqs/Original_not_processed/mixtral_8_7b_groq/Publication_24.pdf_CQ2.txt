Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline for ecoacoustic surveillance and analysis of urban sound data, as described in the provided context, primarily uses spectrograms as the data format. A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies in a signal as it varies with time, often used in the analysis of audio signals.

In this pipeline, audio files are first preprocessed to extract relevant features. One such preprocessing method is converting the audio signal into a spectrogram. The McFee et al. (2015) and Salamon et al. (2014) papers mention the use of librosa, a Python library for audio and music signal analysis, which can generate spectrograms from audio files.

Once the spectrograms are obtained, they are preprocessed further using techniques such as whitening (Lee et al., 2009) and subtraction of mean values along each frequency bin (Aide et al., 2013). These preprocessed spectrograms are then used as inputs for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Deep learning models.

The use of spectrograms as inputs for CNNs is facilitated by the fact that CNNs can accept inputs with multiple channels of data, similar to the red, green, and blue channels of a color image. In this case, multiple spectrograms, each preprocessed using a different normalization strategy, are provided as inputs to the CNN (see Supplementary methods in the provided context).

Therefore, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is primarily the spectrogram, which is a 2D representation of the audio signal with time on the x-axis, frequency on the y-axis, and color representing the amplitude of each frequency at each time point.
