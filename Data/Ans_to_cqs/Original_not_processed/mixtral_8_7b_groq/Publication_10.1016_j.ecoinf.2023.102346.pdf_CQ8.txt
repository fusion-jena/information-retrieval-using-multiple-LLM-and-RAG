Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context includes information about various studies and tools related to geographic information systems, microbial community functions, machine learning, and species distribution modeling. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. It is possible that the deep learning pipeline was developed specifically for the study and is not publicly available, or it may be hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
