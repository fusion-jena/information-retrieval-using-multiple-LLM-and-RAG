Based on the information provided, there is no direct mention of postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, the text does describe the process of calculating the Ecological Source Area (ESA) using a model with different parameters and settings.

After training the model with different initial populations (P) and minimum fitness values, the ESA is calculated using the formulas provided in Table 3 for food, water yield, soil conservation, and carbon storage. The source coverage area, source coverage rate, source connectivity rate, fragmentation index, IIC, and PC are then calculated based on the resulting ESA.

The text mentions that when P = 50, the ESA was found to be the best, with a high source connectivity rate, IIC value, and ecological source coverage rate, and a low fragmentation index. This suggests that some form of evaluation or metrics calculation was performed to determine the quality of the ESA.

However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer about the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
