Answer:::

The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the study involves monitoring the validation loss and observing if it plateaus. In this particular study, the model was trained over 100 epochs, and it was observed that the validation loss continued to decrease throughout the training session. However, the accuracy of the model flattened towards the end of the training session, indicating that the necessary number of epochs required for model convergence had been reached.

Furthermore, the study mentions that increasing the number of epochs would likely lead to overfitting, which is an indication that the model has been trained too well on the training data, and it is no longer able to generalize well to new, unseen data. Overfitting is typically characterized by a large gap between the training and validation loss, where the training loss is much lower than the validation loss.

In this study, the authors used both the validation and test data to monitor the model's performance during training. The validation data was used to check if the model was overfitting, while the test data was used to evaluate the model's performance on new, unseen data. The authors mentioned that the model achieved an accuracy of 0.83 for the train split and 0.74 for the test split, indicating that the model was able to generalize well to new data.

Additionally, the study used dropout layers to help with model regularization, which is a technique used to prevent overfitting. Dropout layers randomly drop out a fraction of the model's neurons during training, which helps to prevent the model from relying too heavily on any particular neuron or set of neurons.

In summary, the criteria used to determine when training is complete in this study involved monitoring the validation loss and observing if it plateaus, checking for overfitting by comparing the training and validation loss, and using dropout layers to help with model regularization.
