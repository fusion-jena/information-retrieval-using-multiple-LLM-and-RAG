Answer:::

In the context provided, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include data augmentation and normalization. Data augmentation is used to increase the diversity of training data by creating modified versions of the images, such as rotations, shifts, and flips. This helps to improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. Normalization is the process of scaling the pixel values of the images to a common range, often between 0 and 1. This helps to improve the stability and efficiency of the training process by ensuring that all of the input data is on a similar scale. Additionally, it is mentioned that the preprocessed images are fed to a transformer-based network EMViT-Net for extracting local and global features of microbes from EM images.

It is also mentioned that the EMViT-Net framework is trained with a specific configuration of an optimizer and learning rate, and it achieves prominent results compared to other deep learning models. The performance of the proposed model EMViT-Net is evaluated on unseen test sets of the dataset EMDS-6 by calculating performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.

It is important to note that the context does not mention any other preprocessing steps such as cleaning, scaling or feature engineering. However, it is common practice to perform these steps as well before training a deep learning model. Cleaning the data refers to removing any irrelevant or missing data points, scaling is the process of adjusting the range of the data to a specific range, and feature engineering is the process of creating new features from the existing data that might help the model to better understand the data.

In summary, the preprocessing steps mentioned in the context include data augmentation and normalization, and it is common practice to perform data cleaning, scaling, and feature engineering as well before training a deep learning model.
