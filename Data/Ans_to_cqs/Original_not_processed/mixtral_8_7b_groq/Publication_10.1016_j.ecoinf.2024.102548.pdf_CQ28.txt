The provided context does not explicitly mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses mainly on the performance comparison of different models, including MobileNet, LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and their combinations, in the context of okra cultivation and Yellow Vein Mosaic Virus (YVMV) detection.

The models' training times are mentioned, but there is no information about the infrastructure or cloud platforms used for training and deployment. It is possible that the authors trained and tested the models using local resources or used different platforms without explicitly mentioning them in the text.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information about the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.

Answer:::
The provided context does not offer information on the platform used to deploy the deep learning model, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.
