Answer:::

The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several statistical accuracy metrics, as shown in Table 1. These metrics include the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Bias, and Correlation. 

The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is a measure of the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values.

The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is a measure of the differences between values predicted by a model and the values actually observed. It is calculated as the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values.

Bias, in this context, refers to the systematic error or deviation of the predictions from the actual values. It is calculated as the average of the differences between the predicted and actual values.

Correlation is a measure of the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. In this case, it measures the relationship between the predicted and actual values. A correlation coefficient close to 1 indicates a strong positive relationship, while a coefficient close to -1 indicates a strong negative relationship.

These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the deep learning model's performance, taking into account both the magnitude and direction of the errors. By comparing these metrics with those of the Random Forest model, it is possible to determine the relative strengths and weaknesses of the two models.

In addition to these metrics, a statistical feature importance test (SFIT) was performed to explain which feature had the greatest significance in the species richness retrievals and to determine the optimized features in an operational retrieval system. The feature importance was determined by measuring the extent to which the model performance decreased with random shuffling of the input variables. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used as the performance metric for this test.

Therefore, the deep learning model's performance is evaluated using a combination of quantitative metrics and statistical feature importance tests, providing a comprehensive assessment of its accuracy and reliability.
