Answer:::

 The provided context does not include information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various aspects of deep learning models such as U2-Net and TrunkNet, their architecture, and the loss function used in their training. However, it does not mention any code repository or its location. Therefore, I am unable to provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
