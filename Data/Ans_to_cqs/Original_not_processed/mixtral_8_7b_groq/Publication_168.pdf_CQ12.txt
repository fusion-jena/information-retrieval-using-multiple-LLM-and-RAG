Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is mentioned in the context when it describes how Hu et al. designed a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D-CNN) for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. The 1-D-CNN is used to classify HSI according to the spectral feature, and it includes a convolution operation, a pooling operation, and a fully connected operation. The pooling layer is mainly applied to compress the input data and often follows the convolutional layer. The max-pooling strategy is used in the designed CNN. Therefore, it is clear that a CNN model is used in the described pipeline for HSI classification.
