Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The text focuses on the comparison of the results of a large-scale forest inventory in the Kammer forest area with the simulation results. It mentions the root mean squared error (rRMSE) values for different estimators, but it does not provide any details about the postprocessing steps.

However, it is mentioned that the analysis of the inventory confirmed some of the results of the simulation and offered new insights. This suggests that some form of comparison or evaluation was performed after the model training. It is also mentioned that the inventory included a total of 245 sample points, but only 169 were used in the study. This implies that some data preprocessing or cleaning was done before the model training.

In summary, while the provided context does not give explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, it suggests that some form of comparison, evaluation, and data preprocessing were performed.
