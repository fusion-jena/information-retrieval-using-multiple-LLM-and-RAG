The provided context discusses various topics related to soil information, data communication, node-based programming, and machine learning techniques. However, it does not directly mention the specific techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer based on the given information.

Nevertheless, I can offer some general techniques used to address data bias in machine learning, which might be applicable to the deep learning pipeline:

1. **Diverse data collection**: Collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the target population can help reduce data bias.

2. **Stratified splitting**: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria (strata) and then ensuring that each stratum is proportionally represented in the training, validation, and testing sets.

3. **Oversampling**: When a particular class is underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to create more instances of that class, either by replicating existing instances or by generating synthetic instances using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

4. **Undersampling**: Conversely, when a particular class is overrepresented in the dataset, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of instances of that class, either by randomly removing instances or by applying more sophisticated methods like Tomek links or Edited Nearest Neighbors.

5. **Reweighing**: In some cases, it might be beneficial to assign different weights to instances based on their class membership, giving more importance to instances from underrepresented classes during training.

6. **Bias correction algorithms**: These are techniques specifically designed to correct bias in the data or the learning algorithm, such as preprocessing methods that adjust input features to make them more balanced or fairness-aware machine learning algorithms that explicitly account for bias during training.

While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, they are commonly used in machine learning to address data bias and might be applicable to the deep learning pipeline as well.
