Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix generation after the model training. However, it does mention that the model training on the hardware took approximately 460 hours and the optimization was stopped once the validation EarthNetScore (ENS) repeatedly failed to improve compared to previous epochs. The model at the epoch with the highest attained validation score was then selected.

In the context of the prediction task, it is mentioned that the SGED-ConvLSTM and SGConvLSTM models were trained and their performance was evaluated based on the validation score. The SGED-ConvLSTM reached its validation score plateau sooner than the SGConvLSTM, but the SGConvLSTM continued to improve and reached its validation score plateau after 92 epochs at a higher final ENS than SGED-ConvLSTM.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the postprocessing steps after the model training may include evaluating and comparing the performance of different models based on the validation score, and selecting the model with the highest attained validation score. However, specific postprocessing steps like saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix generation are not mentioned.
