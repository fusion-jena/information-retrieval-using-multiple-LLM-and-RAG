Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. The text only states that GFW distributes vessel data aggregated at 0.01 resolutions with fishing activity cells already classified through a machine learning model. However, it does not specify the type of deep learning model used (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer). Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
