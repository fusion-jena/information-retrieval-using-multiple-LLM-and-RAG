Answer:::

I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context consists of various research papers and reports that discuss different methods and techniques for classifying and segmenting objects in remote sensing data, particularly in the context of mangrove forests and wetlands. However, none of these sources provide a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in their research. It's possible that the authors have not made the code publicly available, or it may be hosted on a platform that is not mentioned in the papers.
