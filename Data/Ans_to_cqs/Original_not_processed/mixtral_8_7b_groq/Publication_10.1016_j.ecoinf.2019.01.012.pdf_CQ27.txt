Answer:::

The text provided discusses the training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification, but it does not explicitly mention the steps taken to deploy the trained model. However, based on common practices in machine learning and deep learning, we can infer some possible steps that might have been taken.

Firstly, once the model was trained and validated, it would likely have been saved or serialized. Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model so that it can be reloaded and used for making predictions on new data. This is often done using libraries or frameworks specific to the programming language and deep learning library used. For example, in Python with TensorFlow, one might use the `tf.keras.models.save_model` function to save the model.

Secondly, the choice of platform for deployment would depend on the specific requirements of the project. For a web application, the model might be deployed using a web framework like Flask or Django, with the model serving API built using a library like TensorFlow Serving or ONNX. For a mobile or edge device application, the model might be converted to a format suitable for the target platform, such as TensorFlow Lite for Android or Core ML for iOS.

However, these are just possible steps based on common practices. The text provided does not give enough information to definitively answer this question.
