Answer:::

The provided context discusses various applications of deep learning, particularly in the field of computer vision, but it does not explicitly mention data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide a general overview of some common data annotation techniques used for training deep learning models in computer vision tasks.

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in an image. These boxes, also known as bounding boxes, provide the coordinates of the object's location, making it easier for deep learning models to identify and classify objects within the image.

2. Instance segmentation: This method is more precise than bounding box annotation, as it involves segmenting each object within an image at the pixel level. This allows for a more accurate representation of the object's shape and size, which can be helpful for tasks such as object detection and image segmentation.

3. Semantic segmentation: In this technique, pixels within an image are grouped according to their shared characteristics or class labels. Unlike instance segmentation, semantic segmentation does not differentiate between individual objects of the same class.

4. Scene understanding annotation: This method involves annotating an entire scene, including objects, their relationships, and the overall context. This can help deep learning models better understand complex scenes and interactions between objects.

5. Key-point annotation: This technique involves annotating specific points of interest on objects within an image, such as joints on a human body. This can be helpful for tasks such as human pose estimation or object tracking.

While the provided context does not discuss these specific annotation techniques, it does mention the application of deep learning models in object detection and image segmentation tasks, which can benefit from these annotation methods. For instance, the "Deformable DETR: deformable transformers for end-to-end object detection" paper focuses on object detection, which can utilize bounding box annotation or instance segmentation for training. Similarly, the "Rethinking semantic segmentation from a sequence-to-sequence perspective with transformers" paper deals with image segmentation, which can leverage semantic segmentation annotations.
