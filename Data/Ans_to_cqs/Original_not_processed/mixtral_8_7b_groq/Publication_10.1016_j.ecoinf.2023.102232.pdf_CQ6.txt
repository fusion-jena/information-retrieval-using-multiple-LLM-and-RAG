Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, the text describes a process of estimating the parameters of a system using a Least Squares (LS) algorithm and a Genetic Algorithm (GA), which involves some data manipulation that may be relevant for preprocessing.

In the LS algorithm, the entries of the database are ordered from the smaller to the higher sum of the residual values, which is a measure of how well the estimated parameters fit the experimental data. This operation may be seen as a simple form of data sorting or filtering, which is a common preprocessing step in data analysis.

In the GA, a single iteration involves generating random combinations of parameter values from a Gaussian distribution and solving the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) system associated with the problem. The GA generates four random combinations of initial values for each set of best fit values stored in the database, and the variance of the Gaussian distribution is defined as a fixed value that depends on the mean value. This process may be seen as a form of data augmentation or perturbation, which is a technique used to increase the size and diversity of the training data in deep learning.

Moreover, the context mentions that all the calculations were carried out using a scientific computing center with two nodes, each equipped with four processors and 512 GB of RAM, and managed by the Python package Ray. This information suggests that the data processing and computation were performed using high-performance computing resources and parallel processing techniques, which are commonly used in deep learning to handle large datasets and complex models.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, it describes some data manipulation techniques that are relevant for data analysis and machine learning, such as sorting, filtering, data augmentation, and parallel processing. These techniques may be used in conjunction with other preprocessing steps, such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning, to prepare the data for training a deep learning model.
