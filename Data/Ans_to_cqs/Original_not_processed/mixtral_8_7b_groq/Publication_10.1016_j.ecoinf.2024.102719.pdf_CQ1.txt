The provided context does not contain specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some studies and techniques related to river and stream ecosystem health assessment, machine learning, and ecological informatics.

In the context of environmental studies, data collection methods for river and stream ecosystem health assessment may include:

1. Surveys: Researchers might conduct surveys to gather information about human activities and their impact on river health. For example, Best (2019) discusses anthropogenic stresses on the world's big rivers.
2. Sensors: Physical, chemical, and biological parameters of rivers can be measured using sensors. Woo et al. (2019) used a random forest technique for evaluating watershed-scale aquatic ecosystem health by SWAT modeling and incorporating sensor data.
3. Public datasets: Researchers may use publicly available datasets for their studies. For instance, Norris and Hawkins (2000) and Wohl et al. (2005) discuss river health assessment methods, and they might have used public datasets for their research.

In the context of machine learning and deep learning, data collection methods are usually not specified, as these methods are applicable to various types of data from different sources. However, the following studies from the provided context discuss machine learning and deep learning models used for environmental studies and ecological informatics:

1. Breiman (2001) introduced random forests, a popular machine learning algorithm.
2. Chen and Guestrin (2016) presented XGBoost, a scalable tree boosting system.
3. Schuwirth et al. (2023) used machine learning and deep learning models for finding optimal strategies for river quality assessment.

In summary, the provided context does not contain specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, for environmental studies related to river and stream ecosystem health assessment, data collection methods may include surveys, sensors, and public datasets.
