Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically, a Residual Network or ResNet. More precisely, ResNet-50 is utilized for feature extraction from images.

CNNs are neural networks that are designed to process grid-like data, such as images, by using convolutional layers. These layers apply a set of filters to the input data, which help to identify patterns such as edges, shapes, and textures.

ResNet is a variant of CNN that addresses the challenge of vanishing gradients in deep neural networks. It introduces skip connections between the input and output of each block, allowing for the easy training of deeper networks with reduced complexity.

In the given context, the authors compared the training times and validation accuracies of three ResNet models: ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101. They found that ResNet-50 had a marginally higher validation accuracy, making it the preferred choice for feature extraction.

ResNet-50 consists of five convolutional blocks stacked on top of one another. The image features are extracted from the fully connected layers pre-trained with the ImageNet database. The input to the network is an image of 224x224 pixels.

In summary, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Residual Network (ResNet), specifically, ResNet-50, which is a type of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
