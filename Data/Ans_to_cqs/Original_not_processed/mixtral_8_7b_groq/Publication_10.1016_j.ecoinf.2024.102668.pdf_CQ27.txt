Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, the context does discuss the importance of reducing device bias in audio recordings for broader comparative analyses, which could potentially be used in machine learning and deep learning applications.

Moreover, the context highlights the significance of preprocessing in addressing issues related to differences in signal amplitude among recording devices. The proposed preprocessing approach (Figure 2) consists of three steps: (1) gain normalization, (2) filtering, and (3) segmentation. Gain normalization is used to address differences in signal amplitude among recording devices, while filtering is applied to remove noise from the recordings. Segmentation is then used to divide the recordings into smaller, manageable sections for further analysis.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific details on deploying a trained deep learning model, it does emphasize the importance of preprocessing in preparing audio recordings for machine learning and deep learning applications. This preprocessing approach includes gain normalization, which is crucial for addressing differences in signal amplitude among recording devices.
