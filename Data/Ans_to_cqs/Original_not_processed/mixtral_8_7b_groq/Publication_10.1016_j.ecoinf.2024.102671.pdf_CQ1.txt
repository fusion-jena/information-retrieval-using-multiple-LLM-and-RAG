Answer:

The provided context does not directly answer the query regarding the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention several sources of data that could be used as inputs for such a pipeline.

These data sources include socio-economic factor data, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, temperature (TEM) data, food production (FOOD) data, and resource environment science and data research center data. Specifically, the socio-economic factor data may come from sources like Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Population (POP), and Chinese Research Data Services Platform. The NDVI and TEM data may be obtained from resources like Openstreetmap, Geospatial Data Cloud, National Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Scientific Data Research Center, and National Earth System Science Data Center. The FOOD data may be sourced from the Resource Environment Science and Data Research Center.

These data could be collected through various methods such as remote sensing, satellite imagery, ground-based sensors, surveys, and existing databases or repositories. For instance, NDVI and TEM data could be collected using remote sensing and satellite imagery techniques, while socio-economic data like GDP and POP could be gathered through surveys and census data. Food production data could be collected through a combination of remote sensing, ground-based sensors, and existing databases.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest several sources of data that could be used as inputs for such a pipeline. These data could be collected through various methods such as remote sensing, satellite imagery, ground-based sensors, surveys, and existing databases or repositories.
