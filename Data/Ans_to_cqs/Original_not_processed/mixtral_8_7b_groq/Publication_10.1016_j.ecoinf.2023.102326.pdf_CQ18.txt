Answer:

Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The text focuses on the analysis of diel cycles and the comparison of land use mix (LUM) for different recording sites. It discusses various land use types, R2-Thresholds, average shortest path length (ASPL), and standard deviation (STD) values, but it does not mention any details about model training or performance monitoring strategies. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.
