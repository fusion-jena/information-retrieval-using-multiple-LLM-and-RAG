Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of ResNet18FPN, ResNet34FPN, and ResNet152FPN models. These models are all variations of the Residual Network (ResNet) architecture, which is a type of CNN. The context also mentions the use of YOLOv4, which is another type of CNN. Furthermore, the context discusses the use of CNNs for automating animal recognition and counting tasks, and the extraction of abstractly semantic information through the use of more CNN layers. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN.
