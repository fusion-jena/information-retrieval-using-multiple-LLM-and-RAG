Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search.

However, it is mentioned that the Random Forest (RF) hyperparameters in the Geographic Information System (GIS) environment (GEE) implementation were preserved, except for the number of trees, which was set to 500 to improve computational efficiency without losing precision in the BA estimates. This suggests that some level of hyperparameter tuning was performed, but the specific optimization method is not mentioned.

It is also mentioned that the mean decrease in the Gini Index (dGI) was calculated to assess RF variable importance on classification accuracy. This metric is a common tool used in Random Forest models for feature selection and is not directly related to hyperparameter optimization.

Therefore, while some level of hyperparameter tuning may have been performed, the specific method of optimization is not provided in the context.
