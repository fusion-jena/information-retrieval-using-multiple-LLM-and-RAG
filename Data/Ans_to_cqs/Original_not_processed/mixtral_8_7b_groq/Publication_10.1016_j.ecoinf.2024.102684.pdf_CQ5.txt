Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. The text discusses the use of pre-trained networks, which often rely on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet for training. However, the context focuses mainly on the exploration of different fully connected network architectures and data partitioning strategies for remote sensing semantic segmentation, without specifying the exact datasets used. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
