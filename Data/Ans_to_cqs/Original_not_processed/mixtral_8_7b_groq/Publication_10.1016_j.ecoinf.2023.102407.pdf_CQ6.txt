The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models for predicting species distributions, particularly through the use of pseudo-labeling (PL) and a teacher-student structure. However, the text does not explicitly mention the specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models.

In general, when working with deep learning models, common preprocessing steps include data normalization, scaling, and cleaning. Data normalization is the process of adjusting the range of independent variables so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This can help improve the training of the model by making the optimization process more stable. Scaling refers to the adjustment of the range of the features to a common scale, which can also help the model converge faster during training. Cleaning the data involves handling missing values, outliers, and duplicate data points.

In the context of predicting species distributions, additional preprocessing steps might include feature engineering and selection. Feature engineering involves creating new features from the existing data, which can help the model capture more complex relationships between the variables. Feature selection, on the other hand, involves selecting a subset of the most relevant features for the model to use, which can help reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance.

In the specific context of the text, the data used for training the deep learning models are preprocessed environmental data at meter- or kilometer-level resolution. However, the text does not provide details on the specific preprocessing steps taken.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot provide a specific answer to the query regarding the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model.
