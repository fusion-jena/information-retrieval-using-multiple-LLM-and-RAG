Answer:::

The provided context does not directly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss various topics related to data processing, machine learning, and digital soil mapping.

In the context of deep learning, optimization techniques are crucial for training models effectively. Some commonly used optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), and others.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the parameters of a model based on the gradient of the loss function. It is an iterative algorithm that processes one training example at a time, making it computationally efficient.

Adam, on the other hand, is a more advanced optimization algorithm that combines the ideas of momentum and adaptive learning rates. It keeps track of the first and second moments of the gradients and uses them to update the parameters more efficiently.

While the context does not explicitly mention these optimization techniques, it does discuss various machine learning techniques used in digital soil mapping. For instance, the paper by Yang et al. (2022) uses a mixed-integer optimization approach for soil profile horizon delineation. Similarly, the paper by Yang et al. (2021) uses machine learning techniques for estimating soil organic matter content.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly answer the query, it is reasonable to assume that optimization techniques such as SGD and Adam are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. These techniques help to train models effectively by minimizing the loss function and improving the accuracy of the predictions.
