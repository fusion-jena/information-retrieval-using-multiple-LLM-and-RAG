Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the classification of aquatic plant communities using remote sensing techniques and machine learning methods. It mentions the use of the "caret" package in R for classification and regression training, but it does not specify where the code for the deep learning pipeline is located. Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the code repository.
