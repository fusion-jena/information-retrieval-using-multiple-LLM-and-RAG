Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of a balanced dataset as a technique to address data bias during the preprocessing of a machine learning pipeline, specifically for the classification of iceplant and non-iceplant vegetation in high-resolution NAIP imagery. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

In the context, the authors mentioned that they created a balanced final training dataset having 38% iceplant points and 62% other vegetation points. This balance was achieved without having to discard, repeat, or create synthetic data points, indicating that the dataset was initially highly unbalanced. However, the text does not provide information on whether they used any specific techniques such as oversampling or undersampling to balance the dataset.

The authors also mentioned that they used a high-resolution dataset (NAIP) and the entire study region, which allowed them to create a balanced final training dataset. This suggests that they employed a diverse data collection strategy, which helped them gather sufficient data points for both classes.

In summary, based on the provided context, the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the machine learning pipeline include creating a balanced final training dataset, diverse data collection, and potentially oversampling or undersampling, although the text does not explicitly mention these techniques.
