The provided context does not contain information about the specific data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of Kaleidoscope Pro 5.4.7, an automated signal recognition software, to analyze acoustic data of the Nighthawk. The software extracts sounds of interest based on five parameters, including minimum and maximum signal length, minimum and maximum frequency range, and maximum intersyllable gap. However, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
