Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models for detecting man-made underwater objects in optical and sonar data, as well as detecting human activity types from 3D posture data. However, it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for these specific studies.

However, based on general practices in deep learning for computer vision tasks, there are several common data annotation techniques used. These include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a rectangle around the object of interest in an image. The coordinates of the rectangle are then used as labels for the object. This is a simple and widely used annotation technique that works well for objects that are easy to distinguish from their background.
2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image according to the object it belongs to. This provides a more precise localization of the object than bounding box annotation, and can be useful for objects that have complex shapes or are closely packed together.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique is similar to instance segmentation, but instead of labeling each pixel according to the specific object it belongs to, pixels are labeled according to the semantic class they belong to (e.g., "car", "road", "sky"). This can be useful for tasks where the specific identity of objects is not important, but rather their spatial relationships and overall layout.
4. Landmark annotation: This technique involves identifying and labeling key points or landmarks on an object, such as the corners of a bounding box or the joints of a human body. This can be useful for tasks that require precise alignment or measurement of objects.

The specific annotation technique used depends on the task at hand and the nature of the data. For example, in the study by Abu and Diamant (2022), the authors use a contour-based features analysis method, which suggests that they may have used a combination of bounding box and instance segmentation annotations to extract features from the underwater objects. In the study by Çalıs¸kan (2023), the author uses deep learning models to detect human activity types from 3D posture data, which suggests that they may have used landmark annotations to label key points on the human body.

Overall, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for these studies, we can infer from general practices in deep learning for computer vision tasks that techniques such as bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and landmark annotation are commonly used.
