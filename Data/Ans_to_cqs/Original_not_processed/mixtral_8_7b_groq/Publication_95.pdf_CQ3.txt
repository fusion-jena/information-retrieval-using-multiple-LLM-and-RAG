Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of annotation size in the context of training a ResNet50V2 model for image classification, but it does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the images were "binned according to the relative size of their respective annotations with respect to the image size." This suggests that some form of annotation or labeling of the images was done, but the specific method is not provided.

Common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This method involves drawing a bounding box around the object of interest in an image. It is a simple and efficient way to label objects in an image, and it is often used for object detection tasks.
2. Instance segmentation: This method involves labeling each pixel in an image to indicate which object it belongs to. It is a more detailed and time-consuming method than bounding box annotation, but it allows for more precise object localization and can be used for tasks such as semantic segmentation and object counting.
3. Class labeling: This method involves assigning a class label to an entire image. It is a simple and efficient way to label images, but it does not provide information about the location or number of objects within the image.
4. Pixel-level annotation: This method involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class label. It is a more detailed and time-consuming method than class labeling, but it allows for more precise object localization and can be used for tasks such as semantic segmentation.

It is possible that one or more of these methods were used in the study described in the provided context, but the specific method is not mentioned.

In summary, the provided context does not give specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common techniques include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, class labeling, and pixel-level annotation.
