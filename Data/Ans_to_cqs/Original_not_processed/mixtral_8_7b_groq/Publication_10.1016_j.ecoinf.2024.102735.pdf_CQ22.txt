The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does discuss the use of machine learning models for predicting chlorophyll-a as an indicator of harmful algal blooms. Common evaluation metrics for classification models include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Accuracy is the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions. It is a common and straightforward metric, but it may not be representative when the dataset is imbalanced.

Precision, also known as positive predictive value, is the ratio of true positives (correctly predicted positive instances) to the sum of true positives and false positives (incorrectly predicted positive instances). It measures the proportion of correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model.

Recall, also known as sensitivity, is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives (instances that should have been predicted as positive but were not). It measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances in the dataset.

F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics. It is a more robust evaluation metric when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

In the context of predicting chlorophyll-a, the model's performance could be evaluated using these metrics based on the classification of water samples as harmful or non-harmful. However, the specific evaluation metrics used are not mentioned in the provided context.
