Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the specific purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, there are several indications that suggest the model is used for object detection.

Firstly, the paper discusses the use of object detection models for handling multiple species in images and eliminating background pixels from subsequent classification tasks. This implies that the model is capable of identifying and locating objects within an image, which is a key function of object detection.

Secondly, the paper mentions the use of the MegaDetector model, which is a popular open-source object detection model. The MegaDetector model is specifically designed for detecting objects in satellite and aerial imagery, which aligns with the ecological monitoring and management context of the paper.

Thirdly, the paper evaluates the performance of the model using the NACTI dataset, which is a benchmark dataset for object detection in remote sensing imagery. The evaluation metrics used in the paper, such as overall accuracy, also suggest that the model is being used for object detection.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is being used for object detection.
