Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for plant species identification are as follows:

1. Learning rate: The learning rate is set to 10^-3. It is used to control the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function.

2. Momentum: The momentum is set to 0.9. It is used to improve the convergence of the stochastic gradient descent algorithm by incorporating the past gradients.

3. Weight decay: The weight decay is set to 10^-4. It is used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights.

4. Learning rate decay: The learning rate is decreased by a factor of 10 when the validation set accuracy stops improving. This helps to fine-tune the model and avoid getting stuck in a poor local minimum.

The optimization algorithm used in the deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that some form of stochastic gradient descent is used, given the mention of learning rate, momentum, and weight decay.

It is also worth noting that the authors use a fixed learning policy for the parameter setting in training. This means that they do not use techniques like adaptive learning rate or learning rate schedules, which can further improve the optimization capability of deep CNN networks.
