Answer:::
The provided context does not contain information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide a general explanation of some common regularization techniques.

Regularization is a set of techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models, including deep learning. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, to the point where it performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization introduces a penalty on the model's complexity to prevent overfitting.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are L2 regularization and dropout.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the model's weights. This penalty term discourages large weights, which can lead to overfitting. By adding this term to the loss function, the model is forced to find a balance between fitting the training data and keeping the weights small.

Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the model's outputs to zero during training. This forces the model to learn redundant representations, which improves its generalization ability. Dropout can be applied to any layer in the model, but it is most commonly used in fully connected layers.

In summary, L2 regularization and dropout are two common regularization techniques used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that discourages large weights, while dropout randomly sets a fraction of the model's outputs to zero during training, forcing the model to learn redundant representations.
