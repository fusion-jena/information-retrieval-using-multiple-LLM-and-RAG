The provided context does not include information about training a deep learning model or any preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The text focuses on a method for generating redescriptions, which are used as building blocks for identifying new ecoregions based on dental and climate variables. The method involves setting several parameters and filtering the generated redescriptions based on accuracy and the amount of support they have in common with higher-ranked redescriptions.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query using the given context.
