Answer:::
The text provided does not give detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model after it was created. However, it does mention that the model was built using the keras package in R with a TensorFlow backend, and that it was trained using region-specific data from Finnmark and Yamal. The ResNet-50 architecture was used for the model, and it was trained for 55 epochs with a batch size of 64. A one-cycle learning rate policy was used, with a minimum learning rate of 0.000001 and a maximum learning rate of 0.001.

After the model was trained, it was likely serialized (saved to disk) in order to be deployed. Serialization allows the model to be saved in a format that can be easily loaded and used in a variety of platforms. The text does not provide information on the specific platform that the model was deployed to, so it is not possible to answer this part of the query.

In summary, while the text provides some information on how the deep learning model was trained, it does not give detailed information on how the model was deployed. It is likely that the model was serialized and then deployed to a platform for use, but the specifics of this process are not provided.
