Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository for it, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context includes several studies and sources that use various data for different purposes, such as geostatistics, satellite data for PM2.5, climate and soil data, landcover data, and digital elevation models. However, none of these sources mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository for it. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
