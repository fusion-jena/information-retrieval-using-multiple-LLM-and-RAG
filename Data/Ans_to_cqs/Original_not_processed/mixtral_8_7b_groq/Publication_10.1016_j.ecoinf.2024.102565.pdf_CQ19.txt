Based on the provided context, the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the model are not mentioned. The text discusses the use of a Neural Network (NN) model for predicting Total Suspended Sediment (TSS) concentration based on wind speed. It also explains how the number of neurons in the input and output layers of the NN model corresponds to the number of input features (wind speed) and outputs (TSM concentration), respectively. Furthermore, it provides a rule for determining the number of neurons in the hidden layers. However, it does not specify the deep learning framework used for implementing the NN model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
