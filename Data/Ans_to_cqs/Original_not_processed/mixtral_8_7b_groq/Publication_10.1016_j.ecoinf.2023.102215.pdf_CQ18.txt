Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training in the context provided involves the use of the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss function. This loss function measures the difference between the predicted probability and the actual value at each pixel coordinate, providing a quantitative measure of the model's performance at each step of the training process. By minimizing this difference, the model's training effect is improved, leading to a better final performance.

Furthermore, the model's performance is evaluated using seven metrics, including the Mean Absolute Error (M) which assesses the pixel-level similarity between the final saliency map produced by the model and the ground-truth mask. This metric provides a measure of the accuracy of the model in detecting the tree trunks.

The training process is carried out for a fixed number of iterations, and the training loss is monitored to ensure that it converges, indicating that the model has learned the relevant features. The training process takes approximately 11.5 hours for the TrunkNet model, and the inference time for a single image is 58.41 ms, equivalent to 17.12 frames per second.

The computational resources used for training and testing the model include a 14-core Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU with 80 GB of RAM and an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU with 24 GB of memory. The training and test images are uniformly resized to 288 Ã— 288 pixels.

Overall, the strategy for monitoring the model performance during training involves the use of a quantitative loss function, the monitoring of the training loss, and the evaluation of the model's performance using multiple metrics. This approach ensures that the model's training is effective and that its final performance meets the desired accuracy and speed requirements.
