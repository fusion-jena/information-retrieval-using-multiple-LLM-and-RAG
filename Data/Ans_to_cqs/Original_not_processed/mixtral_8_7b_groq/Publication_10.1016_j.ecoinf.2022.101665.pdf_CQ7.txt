Answer:::

In the context provided, the criteria used to split the data for machine learning models, including deep learning models, are to divide the full dataset into three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used for fitting the models, the validation set is used to estimate prediction error for model selection and hyperparameter tuning, while the test set is used for assessing the accuracy of the final model.

In cases where data availability is limited, and setting aside a test set cannot be afforded, resampling methods such as k-fold cross-validation are used. In k-fold cross-validation, the full dataset is split into k approximately equally-sized disjoint subsets or folds. The model is calibrated on k-1 folds, while the remaining fold is used for assessing prediction accuracy. This process is repeated k times, and the overall cross-validation accuracy is estimated by aggregating the residuals over the k folds.

In conventional k-fold cross-validation, the folds are chosen randomly. However, the context does not mention any specific criteria for splitting the data for deep learning models. In deep learning, data splitting criteria can depend on the problem at hand, and various techniques can be used, such as random sampling, stratified sampling, or time-series cross-validation.

Random sampling involves randomly splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets. Stratified sampling ensures that each set has a similar distribution of classes or labels. Time-series cross-validation is used for time-series data, where the data is split based on time intervals.

In summary, while the context provides criteria for splitting the data for machine learning models, it does not mention any specific criteria for deep learning models. The criteria used for deep learning models can depend on the problem at hand, and various techniques can be used, such as random sampling, stratified sampling, or time-series cross-validation.
