Answer:::

The strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include the use of a fixed random seed value and various optimization techniques.

In the study by Minar and Naher (2018), they mention that deep learning models are trained using stochastic gradient descent, which involves randomness in the selection of training examples. However, they do not explicitly mention how they handle this randomness.

In the study by Molle et al. (2022), they do not explicitly mention how they handle randomness in their deep learning pipeline.

In the study by Mos and Hofmeester (2020), they do not mention the use of a fixed random seed value or any other strategies to handle randomness in their deep learning pipeline.

In the study by Norouzzadeh et al. (2021), they do not explicitly mention how they handle randomness in their deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention using the Adam optimizer, which is a stochastic optimization method that uses adaptive learning rates (Kingma and Ba, 2014).

In the study by Kellenberger et al. (2020), they mention using interactive machine learning to accelerate image-based ecological surveys. However, they do not explicitly mention how they handle randomness in their deep learning pipeline.

In the study by Kavzoglu (2009), he mentions increasing the accuracy of neural network classification using refined training data. However, he does not mention how he handles randomness in his deep learning pipeline.

In the study by Kleiven et al. (2022), they mention using camera traps to monitor cyclic vole populations. However, they do not mention how they handle randomness in their deep learning pipeline.

In the study by Krizhevsky et al. (2012), they mention using stochastic pooling to improve the performance of convolutional neural networks. Stochastic pooling introduces randomness in the pooling operation, which can help prevent overfitting.

In the study by BÃ¶hner et al. (2023), they mention training a deep neural network in R using the keras package, an interface to TensorFlow for R. They used the ResNet50 architecture with an adam optimizer. The adam optimizer is a stochastic optimization method that uses adaptive learning rates (Kingma and Ba, 2014). However, they do not mention whether they used a fixed random seed value or any other strategies to handle randomness in their deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the use of a fixed random seed value is a common strategy to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Additionally, various optimization techniques, such as stochastic gradient descent and the Adam optimizer, can help manage randomness and improve model performance. However, not all studies mentioned how they handle randomness in their deep learning pipeline.
