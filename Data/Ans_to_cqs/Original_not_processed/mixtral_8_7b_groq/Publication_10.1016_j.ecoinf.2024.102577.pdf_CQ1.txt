The article "Machine-learning aiding sustainable Indian Ocean tuna purse seine fishery" does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the context and the variables used in the study, we can make some educated guesses.

The study focuses on predicting fishing grounds for tropical tuna species (SKJ, YFT, and BET) and reducing bycatch of vulnerable species (FAL) in the Indian Ocean. The authors applied a machine learning (ML)-based approach to forecast the probability of high catch zones of different species of tropical tuna by training models with environmental data and historical catch and bycatch data.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the raw data used in the deep learning pipeline includes:

1. Environmental data: The study used various environmental variables such as current speed, temperature, sea level anomaly, mixed layer depth, bottom temperature, SST, net primary production, dissolved molecular oxygen concentration, chlorophyll concentration, chlorophyll fronts, SST fronts, thermocline intensity, thermocline depth, temperature gradient, bathymetry, latitude, longitude, and month. These variables were likely collected using sensors such as satellite remote sensing, oceanographic buoys, and research vessels.
2. Historical catch and bycatch data: The study used historical catch and bycatch data to train the ML models. These data were likely collected through fisheries surveys, logbooks, and observer programs.

In summary, while the article does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data, it can be inferred that the data was collected through a combination of sensors, satellite remote sensing, fisheries surveys, logbooks, and observer programs.
