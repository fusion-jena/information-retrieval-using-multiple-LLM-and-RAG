Based on the provided context, the following measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model:

1. Diverse dataset: The model was trained on a dataset that included climate data, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, and mean groundwater data from April to September, all at a 10 m spatial resolution. These diverse data types likely helped the model to learn a wide range of features and patterns, improving its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

2. Cross-validation: Although the context does not explicitly mention cross-validation, it does state that the number of iterations was 150. This suggests that the model was trained and tested multiple times on different subsets of the data, which is a common approach to cross-validation. Cross-validation helps to ensure that the model's performance is not overly dependent on the specific training data used, and can help to identify overfitting.

3. Stratified splitting: The context does not explicitly mention stratified splitting, but it does mention that both climate and DEM data were resampled to 10 m spatial resolution through ArcGIS. This suggests that the data was preprocessed to ensure that it was representative of the entire study area, which is an important step in ensuring that the model can generalize to new data. Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subsets based on important variables (such as climate or DEM data), which can help to ensure that each subset is representative of the overall population.

Overall, the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model include using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, and preprocessing the data to ensure that it is representative of the study area. These measures likely helped to improve the model's ability to perform well on new, unseen data.
