Answer:::
The performance of the deep learning models, namely the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and XGBoost (XGB), are evaluated using several metrics. These metrics include overall accuracy, Kappa statistic, mean F1-score, and per-class F1-scores.

Overall accuracy is the proportion of correctly classified samples out of the total number of samples. The Kappa statistic is a measure of agreement between the predicted and actual classifications, considering the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance. The mean F1-score is the average of the F1-scores for each class, where the F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

The per-class F1-scores for the two independent validation datasets, ABMI and CCMEO, are presented in Figure 3. The F1-scores for the CNN model are shown in blue, and the F1-scores for the XGB model are shown in orange. The open water class shows the highest F1-score for both models, while the marsh and swamp classes have the lowest F1-scores.

The training time, prediction time, optimization time, and hardware requirements for each model are compared in Table 2. The CNN model takes 4 hours to train, while the XGB model takes 2.4 hours for training and 20.68 hours for optimization. The prediction time for the CNN model is 4 hours, and for the XGB model, it is 32.20 hours. The hardware requirements for the CNN model include a desktop with 64 GB of RAM and one Titan X (Maxwell) GPU, while the XGB model requires a desktop with 64 GB of RAM and 64 logical cores.

The confusion matrices for the CNN and XGB models, comparing them to the CCMEO validation data, are presented in Tables A3 and A4. The user accuracy (UA) and producer accuracy (PA) are provided for each class. The user accuracy is the proportion of correctly classified samples for a given class, and the producer accuracy is the proportion of correctly classified samples for a given class, considering all the samples in the actual class.

In summary, the performance of the deep learning models is evaluated using overall accuracy, Kappa statistic, mean F1-score, and per-class F1-scores. The training time, prediction time, optimization time, and hardware requirements for each model are also compared.
