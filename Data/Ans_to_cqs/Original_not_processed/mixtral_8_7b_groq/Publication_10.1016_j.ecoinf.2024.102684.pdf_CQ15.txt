Answer:::
In the deep learning pipeline, the optimization techniques considered in the given context are RMSprop and Adam. These optimization algorithms are used to update the parameters of the model during training.

The RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation) algorithm is a type of gradient descent optimization method that adjusts the learning rate based on the recent gradient history. It is an extension of the standard stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, which uses a fixed learning rate for all parameters and iterations. RMSprop, on the other hand, divides the learning rate by an exponentially decaying average of squared gradients, allowing it to adapt to the local landscape of the function being optimized.

Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) is another optimization algorithm that combines the ideas of RMSprop and momentum. Momentum is a method that accumulates the gradient information from previous iterations to smooth the optimization process and escape shallow local minima. Adam estimates the first and second moments of the gradients and uses them to adapt the learning rate for each parameter. This adaptive learning rate helps the algorithm to converge faster and more efficiently than other optimization methods.

In the provided context, the researchers performed a hyperparameter search that included the optimizer as one of the tunable parameters. They considered two optimizers, RMSprop and Adam, and compared their performance in the deep learning pipeline. Although other optimization techniques like SGD, Adagrad, or Adadelta could have been used, the researchers focused on RMSprop and Adam for their study.

In summary, the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the given context, are RMSprop and Adam. These algorithms help adapt the learning rate during training, improving the model's convergence and performance.
