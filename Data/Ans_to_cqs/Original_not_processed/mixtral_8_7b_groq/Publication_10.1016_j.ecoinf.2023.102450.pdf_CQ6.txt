Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there are no specific preprocessing steps mentioned for the training of deep learning models. However, it can be inferred that data preprocessing is an essential part of these studies as they involve the use of images and videos.

In the study by Sch√ºtz et al., 2021, they applied the YOLOv4 model for detection and motion monitoring of red foxes. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection system that treats object detection as a regression problem, which may not require explicit preprocessing steps like normalization or scaling as in classification problems.

In the study by Wang et al., 2021, they performed group behavior tracking of Daphnia magna based on motion estimation and appearance models. Here, data preprocessing might include steps like noise reduction, segmentation, and feature extraction.

The study by Willi et al., 2019, identified animal species in camera trap images using deep learning and citizen science. In this case, data preprocessing could involve image enhancement techniques, noise reduction, and background subtraction.

Furthermore, in the context related to training a Siamese network using fewer samples, the authors mentioned the impact of interference. This interference could be due to the presence of other objects or animals in the video, which would require preprocessing techniques like object detection and segmentation to separate the target from the non-target.

Therefore, although not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, data preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, cleaning, noise reduction, segmentation, and feature extraction are likely to be involved before training a deep learning model.
