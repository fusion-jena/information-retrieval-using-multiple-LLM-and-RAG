The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models for image classification and object detection include positive predictive value, sensitivity, and F1-measure.

In the context provided, the models are used for whale image classification and counting. The evaluation metrics are used to assess the performance of two CNN-based models in identifying and counting whales in images.

Positive predictive value, also known as precision, measures the proportion of true positive predictions (i.e., images that are correctly classified as whales) out of all positive predictions (i.e., images classified as whales by the model). High positive predictive value indicates that the model returns substantially more actual whales than false ones.

Sensitivity, also known as recall, measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances (i.e., images containing whales). High sensitivity indicates that the model returns most of the actual whales.

The F1-measure provides a balance between precision and sensitivity by taking their harmonic mean. It is a more balanced and robust metric than either precision or recall alone.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in the context of whale image classification and counting. However, they are also commonly used for evaluating the performance of deep learning models in other image classification and object detection tasks.

In summary, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models include positive predictive value, sensitivity, and F1-measure. These metrics are used to assess the model's ability to accurately identify and count whales in images.
