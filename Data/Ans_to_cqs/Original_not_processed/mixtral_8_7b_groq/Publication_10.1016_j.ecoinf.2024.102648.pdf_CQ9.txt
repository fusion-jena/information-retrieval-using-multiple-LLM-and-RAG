Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context focuses on the methodology and results of the study, which employed machine learning and deep learning tools to forecast the percent disease incidence of Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD) in upland cotton.

The study used weather data from 2011 to 2019 recorded at weather stations based in four locations in the north-western zone of India. The data was used to calculate growing degree days (GDD) and other weather parameters, which were then used as inputs for the machine learning and deep learning models.

The deep learning models used in the study include multi-layer perceptron (MLP), which is a type of artificial neural network. The MLP model was trained with a training rate of 0.80 and achieved a high R-squared value, indicating good model performance.

However, the context does not mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query. It is possible that the data repository is not publicly available or was not specified in the study.
