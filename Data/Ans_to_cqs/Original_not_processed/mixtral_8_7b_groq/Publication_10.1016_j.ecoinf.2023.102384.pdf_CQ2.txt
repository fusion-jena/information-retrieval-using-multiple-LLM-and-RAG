Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline can handle various data formats, including images, videos, and CSV files. However, the provided context focuses mainly on the use of image data in deep learning models for agricultural applications.

In the paper "Multi-scale context aggregation by dilated convolutions" by Yu and Koltun (2016), the authors use images of outdoor scenes to train their deep learning model. Similarly, the paper "Very deep convolutional networks for large-scale image recognition" by Simonyan and Zisserman (2015) also uses image data for training their deep learning model.

In the context of agricultural applications, the paper "A vision-based counting and recognition system for infestation of tomato plants by aphids" by Zhong et al. (2018) uses images of tomato plants to detect and recognize aphids. The authors divide the images into smaller patches during the training stage and apply data augmentation techniques such as horizontal and vertical flipping. During the validation phase, they divide the images into regularly-spaced, overlapping patches and process them individually.

The paper "Pest24: A large-scale very small object data set of agricultural pests for multi-target detection" by Wang et al. (2020) introduces a new data set of agricultural pests for multi-target detection. The data set includes images of various agricultural pests, and the authors use object detection algorithms to detect and recognize the pests.

The paper "Using an improved YOLOv4 deep learning network for accurate detection of whitefly and thrips on sticky trap images" by Wang et al. (2021) uses sticky trap images to detect and recognize whiteflies and thrips. The authors use the YOLOv4 deep learning network and improve its performance for accurate detection of the pests.

In summary, the provided context suggests that image data is commonly used in the deep learning pipeline for agricultural applications. The images are divided into smaller patches during the training stage, and data augmentation techniques are applied to increase the diversity of the training data. During the validation phase, the images are processed individually, and the predictions from the patches are combined to obtain the final output. Other data formats, such as videos and CSV files, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
