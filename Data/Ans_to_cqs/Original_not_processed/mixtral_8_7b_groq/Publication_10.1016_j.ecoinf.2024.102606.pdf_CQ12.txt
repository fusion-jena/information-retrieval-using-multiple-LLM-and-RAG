Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is specifically indicated by the use of Faster R-CNN, which is a type of CNN, as the object detection model in the pipeline. Additionally, the backbone network used for Faster R-CNN is Resnet50, which is also a CNN architecture. CNNs are commonly used in computer vision tasks due to their ability to effectively analyze and extract features from image data.
