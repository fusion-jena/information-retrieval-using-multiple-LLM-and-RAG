Answer:

The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the pipeline involves training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on simulated data sets. In the context of machine learning, simulated data sets are often generated by complex models and can take various forms such as numerical data, matrices, or vectors. The CNN model is then used to map a query sequence to a vector of distances. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data formats used in this pipeline are likely to be related to sequential data, such as CSV or text files. However, the specific data formats are not mentioned in the given context.
