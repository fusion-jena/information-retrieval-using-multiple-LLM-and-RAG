Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer some steps that might have been taken based on common deep learning practices.

Answer:

After training the deep learning models (MG and MO) on a small-sized dataset using AlexNet architecture with specific hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, momentum, L2 weight decay, and dropout ratio, the next step would typically be to serialize the models for deployment. Model serialization involves saving the model architecture and learned parameters to a file, which can then be loaded and used for making predictions on new data.

Once the models are serialized, the choice of platform for deployment would depend on the specific use case and requirements. For instance, if the image recognition task is to be performed on a mobile device, a lightweight deep learning framework like TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch Mobile could be used for deployment. On the other hand, if the task is to be performed on a server or a cloud platform, deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras could be used for deployment.

To deploy the model on a server or a cloud platform, the serialized model file would be loaded into the chosen deep learning framework, and a prediction function would be defined to take in new images and output the predicted class labels. The deployed model could then be integrated into a web application or a mobile application using APIs for real-time image recognition.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, we can infer that the models were likely serialized for deployment, and the choice of platform would depend on the specific use case and requirements.
