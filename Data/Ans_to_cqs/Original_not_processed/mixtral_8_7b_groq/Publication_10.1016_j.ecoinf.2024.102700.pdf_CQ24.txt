The provided context does not contain information on strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. The text focuses on the literature search and screening process for studies on species distribution modeling (SDM) and the importance of including biotic, abiotic, and anthropogenic variables in SDM. It discusses data sources, biases, and the interpretation of data in the context of SDM but does not mention strategies for handling randomness in deep learning.
