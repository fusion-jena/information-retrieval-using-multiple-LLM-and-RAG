Answer:::
The DeepLabV3+ algorithm, which is used for semantic segmentation in the investigation mentioned in the context, is developed using the PyTorch library version 1.12.1. Therefore, it can be concluded that PyTorch is the framework used to build the deep learning model in this particular case.

The selection of PyTorch library for building the deep learning model could be attributed to several factors. Firstly, PyTorch provides dynamic computation graphs, which makes it easier to implement and debug complex deep learning models. Secondly, PyTorch has a simple and consistent API for designing and training models, which can help in reducing the development time. Lastly, PyTorch has a strong community and ecosystem, which provides access to a wide range of pre-built models, tools, and libraries, making it a popular choice for deep learning research and development.

It is worth noting that other deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, and Theano are also widely used for building deep learning models. However, based on the provided context, PyTorch is the framework used for building the DeepLabV3+ model.
