Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated which measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that cross-validation and a diverse dataset may have been used.

Firstly, the context describes the use of a confusion matrix to validate the performance of a machine learning model. A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It is particularly useful for understanding the types of errors that the model is making, such as false positives and false negatives. The use of a confusion matrix suggests that some form of validation or testing was performed on the model, which could include cross-validation.

Cross-validation is a technique that is commonly used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models and to ensure their generalizability. In k-fold cross-validation, the dataset is divided into k subsets or "folds". The model is then trained on k-1 of these folds, while the remaining fold is held back for testing. This process is repeated k times, with a different fold being held back for testing each time. The results from each of the k runs are then averaged to provide an overall measure of the model's performance.

Secondly, the context describes the use of a variety of techniques for extracting features from the input data, including hand-crafted descriptors and deep convolutional neural network (D-CNN) models. The use of multiple techniques suggests that the dataset may be diverse and may contain a variety of different types of data. A diverse dataset can help to ensure the generalizability of a machine learning model, as it allows the model to learn from a wider range of examples.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly state which measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, there are some indications that cross-validation and a diverse dataset may have been used. However, further information would be needed to confirm this.
