Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model have not been mentioned. The text describes the use of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, which is a type of artificial neural network, and the integration of this model with a Markov chain for land use and land cover (LULC) simulation. However, it does not specify the use of any particular deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
