Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. However, the text does describe the experimental design and training parameters for a series of ablation experiments evaluating enhancements to a YOLOv8 model.

The described training parameters include a batch size of 16, input image resolution of 640 Ã— 640, 150 epochs, a learning rate of 0.01, and the Adam optimizer. Additionally, depth_scale and width_scale parameters are assigned values of 0.33 and 0.25, respectively. These parameters can influence the model's capacity and complexity, indirectly helping to prevent overfitting.

However, common regularization techniques such as dropout, L1/L2 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation are not explicitly mentioned in the context. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input neurons to zero during training, preventing over-reliance on specific connections. L1/L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights and reducing overfitting. Early stopping halts training when performance on a validation set stops improving, while data augmentation increases the diversity of the training data.

In summary, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting. However, it does describe other training parameters and techniques that can indirectly contribute to preventing overfitting. Common regularization techniques like dropout, L1/L2 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation are not mentioned in the context.
