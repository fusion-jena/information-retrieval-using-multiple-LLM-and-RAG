The provided context does not directly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in hydrological modelling, which is a specific application of deep learning. In this context, the ANN model utilizes various input variables such as precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, and watershed characteristics for rainfall-runoff predictions.

In general, for deep learning applications, data annotation techniques are crucial for training the models. Some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include:

1. **Bounding box annotation**: This technique involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image. It is commonly used for object detection tasks, where the goal is to locate the object within the image.

2. **Semantic segmentation**: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class. It is used for image segmentation tasks, where the goal is to classify each pixel in the image.

3. **Instance segmentation**: This is a more advanced form of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and labeled individually. It is used for tasks where the number and location of instances of an object are important, such as in counting objects.

4. **Class labeling**: This technique involves assigning a class label to an entire image or a segment of an image. It is used for image classification tasks, where the goal is to assign a class label to the entire image.

5. **Keypoint annotation**: This technique involves identifying and labeling key points or landmarks on an object. It is used for tasks such as facial recognition or pose estimation.

Without specific information from the provided context, it is not possible to say which of these techniques were used in the hydrological modelling application. However, it is mentioned that ANNs are used to "decipher intricate patterns and relationships in diverse datasets," which suggests that some form of data annotation was likely used to prepare the data for the model.
