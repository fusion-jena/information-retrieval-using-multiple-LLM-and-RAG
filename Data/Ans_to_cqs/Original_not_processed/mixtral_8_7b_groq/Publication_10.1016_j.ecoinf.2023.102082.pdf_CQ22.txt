Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention three metrics related to the assessment of biodiversity patterns in forest ecosystems: R2, RMSE, and MAE. These metrics are used to evaluate the correlation between GEDI CHMs and tree species diversity.

Moreover, the context also mentions the use of a deep learning convolutional neural network to create a high-resolution CHM of the Earth (Lang10m) using Sentinel-2 images. The Lang10m appears to have higher CHM heterogeneity with more extreme CHM values, indicating that the model is able to capture finer spatial details.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the use of accuracy, precision, or recall as metrics to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model, it does provide evidence that the model is able to capture finer spatial details and correlate CHMs with tree species diversity, which could be considered as indirect measures of the model's performance.
