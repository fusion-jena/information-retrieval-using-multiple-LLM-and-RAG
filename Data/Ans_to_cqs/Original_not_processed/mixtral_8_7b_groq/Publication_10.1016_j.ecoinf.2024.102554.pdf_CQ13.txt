Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific deep learning model, its architecture, or the hyperparameters used in the study. The text focuses on the transformation of aquatic environmental monitoring using technological advancements, particularly satellite data interpretation and machine learning methodologies. However, it does not delve into the specifics of the deep learning models or hyperparameters.

Hyperparameters are crucial components of deep learning models, including learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, and more. These parameters significantly influence the model's performance and need to be carefully selected or optimized.

In the context provided, the focus is on the development of sophisticated algorithms for atmospheric correction, optimized for application with data from the Sentinel-3 satellite, specifically for the nuanced analysis of Chl-a concentrations in shallow lakes. While the study mentions the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques, it does not give details about the hyperparameters.

Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to the query without additional information.

Answer:::
The provided context does not include information on the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
