The provided context does not include information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of machine learning models in species distribution modeling and environmental impact assessment, but it does not mention any specific deep learning techniques or pipelines.

Machine learning models such as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) are used in the studies, but these are not deep learning models. Deep learning models are a subset of machine learning models that are particularly well-suited for handling large and complex datasets.

Optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to adjust the weights and biases of the model during training. These techniques help to minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance. However, the provided context does not mention any of these optimization techniques.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
