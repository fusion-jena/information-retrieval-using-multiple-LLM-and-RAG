The data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study "Predicting animal behavior using deep learning: GPS data alone accurately predict diving in seabirds" by Browning et al. is not directly mentioned to be available on popular data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, the GPS track data used in the analysis is available at <http://seabirdtracking.org/mapper/contributor.php?contributor_id=950>. The study used these GPS track data along with dive data and associated matrices for their analysis.

Additionally, the models constructed in the study are available at <https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.t7ck5>. The study used H2O, an open-source machine learning platform for constructing the deep learning models. The researchers used R Interface for H2O for building the models.

It is worth noting that the GPS dive data used in the study is under a one-year embargo, and interested researchers are advised to contact the corresponding authors for more information.

Therefore, while the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned, some of the data and models used in the study are available in the provided links.
