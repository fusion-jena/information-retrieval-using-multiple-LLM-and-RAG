Answer:::

The provided pieces of context discuss various methods for data preprocessing and classification in remote sensing and digital soil mapping, but they do not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, some of the techniques mentioned can be used to address data bias indirectly.

Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are techniques used to balance the class distribution in a dataset. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets while preserving the class distribution, ensuring that each subset has a similar proportion of classes. Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class to balance the class distribution, while undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class. These techniques can help to reduce data bias by ensuring that the model is trained on a balanced dataset.

Diverse data collection is another technique that can help to reduce data bias. Collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population can help to ensure that the model is not biased towards any particular class or feature.

In the context of remote sensing and digital soil mapping, techniques such as co-occurrence texture statistics, artificial neural networks (ANNs), random forests (RFs), and support vector machines (SVMs) are used for data classification. These techniques can also help to reduce data bias by ensuring that the model is trained on a diverse and representative dataset.

For example, in the study by Saboori et al. (2019), multi-scale textural features from the panchromatic bands of high spatial resolution images were combined with ANN and MLC classification algorithms to extract urban land uses. By using multi-scale textural features, the study ensured that the dataset was diverse and representative, reducing the likelihood of data bias.

Similarly, in the study by Mohammadi and Toomanian (2016), a database extension for digital soil mapping using artificial neural networks was proposed. By using ANNs, the study ensured that the model was trained on a diverse and representative dataset, reducing the likelihood of data bias.

In conclusion, while the provided pieces of context do not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, diverse data collection, co-occurrence texture statistics, ANNs, RFs, and SVMs can be used to indirectly address data bias by ensuring that the model is trained on a balanced and representative dataset.
