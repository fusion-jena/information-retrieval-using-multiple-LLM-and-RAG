The provided context discusses the preprocessing steps taken before training a species distribution model, particularly for the An. darlingi species. While this is not a deep learning model, we can still extract relevant preprocessing techniques that are applicable to a wide range of models, including deep learning.

Answer:
The preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model can include normalization, scaling, and cleaning, as well as other steps specific to the problem and data being used. In the context of the species distribution model for An. darlingi, the following preprocessing steps were taken:

1. Background generation: One hundred replicates of background sites were generated for each set (pres_UNB and pres_B) and for each value of k using a uniform random selection. This step aims at creating a balanced dataset for model training.

2. Parameterization of correction methods: The correction methods were parameterized using knowledge from the literature and experts in the ecology of the An. darlingi species. This step involves setting parameters based on the species' biology and the study area.

3. Environmental space transformation: The model input data were transformed using four approaches to modify the presence dataset distribution and make it tend toward a uniform distribution. This step aims at reducing bias in the presence data.

4. Dmin calculation: Dmin was calculated based on the set of pixels where the species was observed (P) and the set of pixels where the species is known to be absent (U). This step helps define the minimum distance between presence and absence pixels in the environmental space.

5. Sampling effort definition: The sampling effort for each pixel was calculated based on the set of pixels in the study area (X) and the set of sampled pixels (S). This step helps account for the uneven sampling distribution in the study area.

These preprocessing steps demonstrate the importance of understanding the data and problem at hand, and tailoring the preprocessing techniques accordingly. While not all steps may be directly applicable to deep learning models, the general principles of data balancing, bias reduction, and accounting for sampling effort remain relevant.
