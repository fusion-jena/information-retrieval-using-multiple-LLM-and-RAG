Based on the provided context, the specific method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model is not explicitly mentioned. There is no information indicating that a grid search, random search, or any other specific optimization technique was used.

However, it is mentioned that the optimizer Adam was selected with an initial learning rate of (cid:0) 7. This suggests that some level of hyperparameter tuning was performed, but the exact method is not specified. Additionally, early stopping was used to prevent overfitting, which is another hyperparameter-related decision.

Furthermore, the model was trained for between 10 and 15 epochs, which implies that there was some monitoring and adjustment of the training process. However, this could have been done manually, or it could have been automated using a hyperparameter optimization technique.

In conclusion, while it is clear that some hyperparameter tuning was performed, the specific method used is not specified in the given context.
