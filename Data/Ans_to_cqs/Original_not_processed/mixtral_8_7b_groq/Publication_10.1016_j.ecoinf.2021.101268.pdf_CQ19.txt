Answer:::
The text provided does not give explicit information about the deep learning frameworks used to build the models. However, it mentions the use of pre-trained models, which implies that these models were built using a deep learning framework capable of handling pre-trained models. Common deep learning frameworks that support pre-trained models include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras.

For instance, AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201 are well-known pre-trained models that can be implemented using popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. These models were developed using large-scale datasets like ImageNet, and fine-tuning them for specific tasks is a common practice.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the deep learning frameworks used, it is highly likely that TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras were used, given the context of pre-trained models and fine-tuning.
