Answer:::

Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of the code repository location for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The authors have shared the journals, article title, author names, and keywords related to their research on utilizing deep learning tools to map and monitor biological soil crusts. They have also shared an image (Figure 3) that illustrates their methodological workflow, including data processing and deep learning implementation using Python and PyTorch libraries.

However, the code repository location, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, is not mentioned in the provided context. It is common for researchers to share their code repositories to promote transparency and reproducibility of their research. Still, it is not guaranteed that they will share it in all cases.

Therefore, I would recommend contacting the authors directly or checking their affiliated institutions' websites for any additional information regarding the code repository location.
