Based on the given context, there is no specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context focuses on the description of various studies related to machine learning, particularly in the field of ecological informatics.

In the study by Blondel et al. (2011), they introduced scikit-learn, a machine learning library for Python, but they did not mention any details about the hardware resources used for training deep learning models.

Petty et al. (2012) discussed a case study on inferring habitat suitability and spread patterns of an exotic invasive pasture grass in North Australia, but they did not provide information about the hardware resources used for their machine learning models.

Prasai et al. (2021) presented a study on land use and land cover classification using Google Earth Engine Python API and NAIP imagery in Florida, USA. However, they did not mention any details about the hardware resources used for training deep learning models.

The context also includes a table (Table A.5) presenting accuracy metrics for models using various features and window sizes for classifying iceplant and other vegetation. Although this table provides information about model performance, it does not mention any details about the hardware resources used for training the models.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.

Answer::: The provided context does not contain information about the hardware resources used for training deep learning models.
