Answer:::
Based on the provided context, several types of deep learning models are used in the various pipelines mentioned.

Firstly, Cspnet, a new backbone that enhances the learning capability of CNN, is used in the context of computer vision and pattern recognition. CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) are a type of deep learning model that is particularly good at processing grid-like data, such as images.

Secondly, an encoder-decoder based deep learning model is used to estimate seagrass coverage, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 90.66%. Encoder-decoder models are a type of neural network architecture commonly used in sequence-to-sequence tasks, such as machine translation.

Thirdly, a deep capsule network (DCN) and a deep CNN are used to map seagrass distribution. CNNs are used again here, while DCNs are a type of neural network that can recognize spatial hierarchies in an image, making them well-suited to object recognition tasks.

Fourthly, a convolutional layer based NN model is used to map Posidonia oceanica seagrass, achieving high precision, recall, and accuracy. This model uses convolutional layers, a key component of CNNs.

Lastly, Faster R-CNN with the NASNet model is proposed to achieve the highest mAP in mapping Halophila ovalis seagrass. Faster R-CNN is a type of two-stage object detection model that first generates region proposals and then classifies these proposals.

In summary, the types of deep learning models used in the pipelines mentioned are CNN, encoder-decoder, DCN, and Faster R-CNN. These models are chosen for their strengths in processing grid-like data, recognizing spatial hierarchies, and object detection tasks.
