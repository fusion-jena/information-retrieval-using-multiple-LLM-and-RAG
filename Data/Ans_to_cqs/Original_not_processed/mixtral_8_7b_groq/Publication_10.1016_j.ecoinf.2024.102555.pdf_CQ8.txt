Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the study area, which is China, and the impact of human activities on NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). It mentions the Grain-for-Green program and the Green-for-Grain Project, which have significantly increased vegetation coverage in certain regions of China. However, there is no mention of any code repository or deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
