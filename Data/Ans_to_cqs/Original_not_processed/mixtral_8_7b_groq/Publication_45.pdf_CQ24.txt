Answer:::

The text provided does not give specific details about the strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that they used the H2O platform, which provides a set of fast and scalable learning algorithms and is integrated within the R software and environment. The H2O platform includes a function to set a random seed value for the purpose of reproducibility. This function ensures that the random numbers generated during the training process are the same each time the code is run, which can be important for verifying the results and comparing different models. It is likely that the authors used this function to handle randomness in their deep learning pipeline, but the text does not explicitly confirm this.

Additionally, deep learning models often use random initialization of the weights and biases during the training process. This random initialization helps the model to break symmetry and explore different parts of the weight space, which can lead to better generalization. The text does not mention if the authors used any specific strategy to handle this randomness, but it is a common practice in deep learning.

In summary, while the text does not provide specific details about the strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that the authors used the random seed function provided by the H2O platform and the random initialization of the weights and biases during the training process.
