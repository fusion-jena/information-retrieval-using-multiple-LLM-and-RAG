Answer:::
Based on the provided pieces of context, there is no explicit information given about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. The context focuses on the use of Gompertz population models for the feature extractions of population time series, specifically in the context of rabbit populations. The number of rabbits (Nt) was transformed using natural logarithm transformations. However, the details of the deep learning model, including its hyperparameters, are not provided.

Hyperparameters are important components of deep learning models, as they can significantly impact the model's performance. Common hyperparameters in deep learning models include the learning rate, which determines the step size at each iteration of the training process, and the optimizer, which is used to update the model's weights and biases. Other hyperparameters may include the number of layers in the model, the number of units in each layer, and regularization parameters.

Therefore, while the context provides valuable information about the use of Gompertz population models for feature extraction in rabbit population time series, it does not provide sufficient information to answer the query regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
