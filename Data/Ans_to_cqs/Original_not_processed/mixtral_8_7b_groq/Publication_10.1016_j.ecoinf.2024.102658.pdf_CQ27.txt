Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the deployment of a deep learning model. The text mainly discusses the process of selecting and building Species Distribution Models (SDMs) using both machine learning and process-based models. The iterative model exploration follows the Bayesian workflow described by Gelman et al. (2020), but it does not mention deep learning models in this context.

The models chosen for comparison include Bayesian logistic regression and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) logistic regression as less flexible models, and Bayesian Generalized Additive Models (GAM) and random forest as more flexible models. Specifically, the baseline model is a random forest model. However, deep learning models are not part of the discussed models or their deployment process.

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide information on the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, as it is not covered in the text.
