The purpose of the deep learning model used in the study is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the described methodology and the context of the research, it can be inferred that the model is primarily used for prediction and forecasting.

The study employs a hybrid model that combines wavelet analysis and the NARX Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm to define vegetation biomass density for the year 2030. This implies that the model is used to predict future vegetation biomass density based on historical and current data.

The NARX model, a type of artificial neural network model, is widely used for modeling studies and is known for its ability to learn from past and present data, uncover hidden relationships among the data, and utilize them to make predictions for future scenarios. In this study, the NARX feedback ANN model is used to predict vegetation biomass density, which suggests that the deep learning model's primary purpose is prediction.

Furthermore, the model is used to determine the optimal configuration of the number of neurons in the hidden layer, which influences the learning capability of the network. This process of optimizing the model's architecture also supports the inference that the deep learning model's primary purpose is prediction and forecasting.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly state the deep learning model's purpose, it can be inferred that the model is primarily used for prediction and forecasting based on the study's objectives and the methodology employed.
