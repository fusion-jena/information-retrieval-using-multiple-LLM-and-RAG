Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention the use of a deep learning model in the study. The models employed in the study are specified as Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), which are not deep learning models. Deep learning models typically involve multiple layers of neural networks and require hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons per layer, activation functions, etc. However, these details are not provided in the context. Therefore, I cannot accurately answer the query without additional information.
