Answer:::
The provided text does not explicitly mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only discusses the development and training of the model using various machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including Deep Neural Networks. The text also mentions hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV with cross-validation and the division of data into training, validation, and test sets. However, it does not give information about the deployment of the model on a specific cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
