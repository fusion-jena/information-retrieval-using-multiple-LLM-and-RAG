Based on the information provided, the specific deep learning frameworks used by Halgamuge et al. (2020) and Charizanos and Demirhan (2023) in their studies on wildfire event prediction in Australia are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that they likely used a popular deep learning library or framework, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, since these are widely used and well-documented for deep learning research and development.

Halgamuge et al. (2020) developed an algorithm for automatic data collection and analyzed six different optimizer models using deep learning technology. They concluded that their approach could predict natural disasters, including wildfire events, by investigating historical environmental conditions before and after wildfires occurred using deep learning methodology.

Charizanos and Demirhan (2023) employed regression models in their study, but the specific deep learning framework used for these models is not specified. They focused on developing a seasonal prediction system for wildfire event prediction in Australia, measuring spatio-temporal variations and seasonality across several datasets, and utilizing this methodology to predict wildfire events, focusing on the seasonal predictions using the 2019-2020 wildfire season as an example and measuring long-term predictions.

In summary, while the specific deep learning frameworks used by Halgamuge et al. (2020) and Charizanos and Demirhan (2023) are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is reasonable to assume that they used popular deep learning libraries or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
