Answer:::

Before training a deep learning model, several data preprocessing steps are typically involved, including data filtering, gap filling, and scaling. These steps are essential to ensure the quality and compatibility of the data for the model.

Firstly, data filtering is an important preprocessing step that involves selecting and extracting relevant data based on specific criteria. This process helps to remove any unwanted or irrelevant data that may negatively impact the model's performance.

Secondly, gap filling is a crucial step in data preprocessing, especially when dealing with time-series data. Gap filling involves replacing missing or invalid data points with estimated or interpolated values. This step ensures that the data is complete and ready for further processing.

Thirdly, data scaling is a critical preprocessing step that involves adjusting the data's range and distribution to improve the model's performance. Scaling the data ensures that all features have similar ranges and distributions, preventing any feature from dominating the model's training process.

In the provided context, data scaling is achieved through a "pre-modelling scaling" protocol, where sequential processes are implemented within GEE for scaling up environmental time-series data from one spatial and/or temporal scale to another during data extraction. Spatial scaling involves applying a scaling process to each metric of the time series, while temporal scaling is achieved through a formula that defines how data is temporally aggregated, such as by a mean, median, or standard deviation.

For instance, a parametrizable function, addTexture_3 Ã— 3_Mean, is used to exemplify spatial scaling. This function includes neighbourhood operations by applying spatial moving windows with a size of 3 pixels and the aggregation formula given by the mean.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include data filtering, gap filling, and data scaling, with a particular focus on spatial and temporal scaling. These steps are essential to ensure the quality and compatibility of the data for the model, ultimately leading to improved model performance.
