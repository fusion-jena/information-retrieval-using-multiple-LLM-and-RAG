Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of a data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The sources mainly discuss various topics related to machine learning, spatial sampling, and data analysis in different fields such as soil science and marine habitat mapping. They do not mention any deep learning pipeline or data repository link associated with it.

It is important to note that the context includes a discussion on minimizing biased training of machine learning models with clustered data, as well as the importance of design-based strategies for handling clustered data that yield spatially autocorrelated errors. However, these discussions do not provide a data repository link either.

In summary, I cannot provide a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline because it is not mentioned in the given context.
