Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline for soil-related applications. However, I can provide some general insights into the data formats typically used in deep learning.

Answer:::
In deep learning, various data formats can be used, depending on the specific application and the type of data being processed. Some common data formats include:

1. Images: Image data is often used in computer vision tasks, such as object detection, image segmentation, and image classification. Image data can be in various formats, such as JPEG, PNG, or TIFF.

2. Audio: Audio data is used in applications such as speech recognition, music information retrieval, and audio event detection. Audio data is typically stored in formats like WAV, MP3, or FLAC.

3. Video: Video data is used in applications like video action recognition, object tracking, and video summarization. Video data is usually stored in formats like MP4, AVI, or MOV.

4. Tabular data (CSV, TSV, etc.): Tabular data, often stored in CSV or TSV format, is used in applications like natural language processing, time-series forecasting, and recommendation systems.

5. Other formats: Deep learning can also handle other data formats, such as JSON for text data or raw binary files for specific applications.

While the context does not provide information on the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline for soil-related applications, it does mention the use of machine learning methods for soil moisture estimation (Jarray et al., 2022) and soil texture estimation (Andrade et al., 2022). It is likely that these studies use tabular data formats (CSV, TSV) for input data, but without access to the specific papers, this is only an educated guess.
