Answer:::

 The provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the methodology and results of a study that uses a deep learning model to predict wildfire response of forest species from multispectral LiDAR data. It explains how the model was trained using synthetic data and then validated using a small number of real MS point clouds. However, it does not mention any data repository or provide a link to access the deep learning pipeline or the dataset used in the study. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link in response to the query.
