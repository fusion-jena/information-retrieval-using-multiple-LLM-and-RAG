Based on the provided context, the specific deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned. However, there are references to various machine learning models such as TKNN, TRF, TAdaBoost, TXGBoost, and TLightGBM, which are base models used for prediction. These models are combined and used as input for a meta-model based on the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The RF algorithm is used to generate the prediction results by 5-fold cross-validation. The final classification result is obtained by voting.

Given this information, it can be inferred that the overall approach is focused on classification rather than segmentation or detection. Specifically, it appears to be a multi-class classification problem where the goal is to predict the class label for each sample in the dataset.

The deep learning model mentioned in the query is not explicitly used in the described approach. However, it is possible that the authors used a deep learning model as one of the base models (TKNN, TRF, TAdaBoost, TXGBoost, or TLightGBM) or as a part of the feature extraction process.

In summary, based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model in this case is for classification, where the model is used as one of the base models for generating prediction results. However, the specific deep learning model is not specified in the given text.
