Answer:::
I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or any code repository links related to it. The context mainly discusses bivalves, specifically their metabolic functions, gaping activity, and deployments in the Venice lagoon. Therefore, I'm unable to provide the requested link to the deep learning pipeline.
