Answer:::

The specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model in the given context is not provided. However, there are indications that GPUs were used for machine learning algorithms in one of the references (Steinkraus, Buck, & Simard, 2005).

In the paper "Cover Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks" (Remote Sens. 2019, 11, 274), the authors used Inception v.3, a type of convolutional neural network (CNN), for cover classificaion. They obtained five models by training Inception v.3 on five created datasets. To improve the performance of the CNN-based models, they used data augmentation techniques, which have been proposed to reduce the requirement of a large dataset for model training.

The training of the last two fully connected network layers in their dataset was conducted using a learning rate of 0.001 and a decay factor of 16 every 30 epochs. As an optimization algorithm, they used RMSProp with a momentum of 0.9 and epsilon of 0.1.

In the reference "Using GPUs for machine learning algorithms" (Steinkraus, Buck, & Simard, 2005), the authors discussed the use of GPUs for machine learning algorithms. They presented a GPU-based implementation of a support vector machine (SVM) for image classification. Their results showed that GPUs can significantly speed up the training of machine learning algorithms compared to CPUs.

Therefore, while the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model in the given context are not specified, the use of GPUs for machine learning algorithms, including CNNs, is indicated in the references.
