Answer:::

In the context provided, there are two main strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline: the use of a specific integer seed for weight initialization and the application of the train_test_split function with a fixed random state.

Firstly, the model's weights were randomly initialized using a specific integer seed. This ensured consistent reproducibility of results, as it guaranteed that the same set of initial weights would be used each time the model was trained. This is crucial for comparing different training runs, models, or hyperparameter configurations, as it allows researchers to control for the randomness introduced during weight initialization.

Secondly, the train_test_split function from the scikit-learn library was used to randomly split the dataset into training and testing subsets. This function allows for a fixed random state to be set, ensuring that the same random split of the data is obtained in every execution of the code. In this particular study, 70% of the data was designated for training, and the remaining 30% was set aside for testing. This approach helps to manage randomness by ensuring that the same samples are consistently included in the training and testing sets, enabling fair performance evaluation and comparisons across different models or hyperparameter configurations.

In summary, the use of a specific integer seed for weight initialization and the application of a fixed random state in the train_test_split function are the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline in the provided context. These methods ensure consistent reproducibility of results and enable fair performance evaluations.
