The provided context does not mention any specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for underwater object detection. However, it can be inferred that the pipeline might require a substantial amount of underwater image data for training, as mentioned that methods like DP-FishNet require a significant amount of underwater image data.

The context mainly focuses on the challenges faced in underwater object detection, such as insufficient clarity of underwater optical images, and the solutions implemented to overcome these challenges. The original YOLOv8 network uses the C2f module for feature extraction, which employs a split operation on features after convolution, dividing the input data into two non-overlapping parts. To overcome the computational complexity issue, the authors used dilated convolution and depthwise separable convolution to reduce computations.

The context also introduces the CSMB module, which replaces the split operation of the C2f module with two independent convolutions, performing convolutional computations on a feature map and concatenating the results with the results processed by DarknetBottleneck. This method enables more effective feature extraction and analysis of features from poor-quality underwater optical images.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for underwater object detection, it can be inferred that a substantial amount of underwater image data is required for training the models.
