I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about a code repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of fire risk maps, vegetation indices, Landsat 8 imagery, and various data in the MuÄŸla province of Turkey, but it does not mention any code repository or deep learning pipeline implementation details.
