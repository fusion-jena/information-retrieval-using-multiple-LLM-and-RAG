The text provided does not give explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model (CNN). However, it can be inferred that some steps were taken to assess the model's performance and validate the results.

Firstly, the model's performance was evaluated on two independent validation data sets, ABMI plots and CCMEO. This provides an indication of how well the model performs on unseen data, which is crucial for assessing the model's ability to generalize.

Secondly, the model's performance was compared to another model, XGB, and to photo-interpretation validation data. This allows for a comparison of the deep learning model's performance to a different type of model and to human-interpreted data, which can provide insights into the model's strengths and weaknesses.

Lastly, the text mentions that the CNN model outperforms the XGB model in terms of overall accuracy, Kappa statistic, and per-class F1-score. This suggests that the CNN model may have a better ability to generalize, as it performs better on the validation data sets.

However, the text does not provide information on whether a diverse dataset was used, or whether cross-validation or stratified splitting were employed. These are common techniques used to ensure the generalizability of machine learning models, and it would be beneficial to know if they were used in this study.

In conclusion, while the text provides some information on the validation of the deep learning model, it does not explicitly state the measures taken to ensure the model's generalizability. It can be inferred that the model's performance was evaluated on independent validation data sets and compared to other models and human-interpreted data, but it is unclear if other techniques such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting were used.
