Answer:::

The provided context discusses data augmentation techniques used to improve the performance of deep learning models for bird audio detection, but it does not directly mention the strategies for addressing data bias during preprocessing such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does mention the addition of noise from audio chunks that do not contain bird events, which could potentially help in balancing the dataset.

In the table, two types of noise (Primary background noise (BAD) and Secondary background noise (BAD)) are added, which might be a way to balance the dataset by adding more examples of non-bird sounds. This technique is similar to oversampling the minority class in a biased dataset.

Furthermore, the authors plan to focus on creating no-call classifiers, which implies that they are aware of the class imbalance problem and are working towards addressing it.

To summarize, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategies for addressing data bias during preprocessing, it does suggest techniques that could potentially be used to balance the dataset, such as adding noise from audio chunks without bird events. Additionally, the authors' plan to focus on creating no-call classifiers indicates their awareness of the class imbalance problem.
