Answer:::

The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the provided context is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information given, it can be inferred that the training process is determined by the number of epochs and the use of cross-entropy and regularization loss.

In the model training section, it is mentioned that models with less than 100 layers are trained for 60 epochs, while models with more layers are trained for 80 epochs. This suggests that the number of epochs is a factor in determining when training is complete.

Additionally, the model loss is computed by adding softmax cross-entropy and regularization loss. Cross-entropy measures the distance between two distributions, and a lower cross-entropy indicates that the predicted distribution is closer to the actual distribution. Regularization loss is used to reduce overfitting and balance model performance and complexity. By normalizing losses using softmax, the true loss value is mapped between zero and one.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the training process is complete when the model loss, as determined by the cross-entropy and regularization loss, reaches a satisfactory level or plateaus, indicating that further training will not significantly improve the model's performance. However, the specific threshold or criteria for determining when the model loss has reached a satisfactory level is not provided in the context.
