Answer:::

The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the given context is when the loss rate of the model is less than a preset threshold ɛ (specifically, ɛ = 1.0 × 10^-4). This is the iteration termination condition for the model in each round of training. The same test set, Test, is used to evaluate the performance of models in different training phases. It is important to note that the evaluation of model performance includes both errors and time costs.

The error evaluation uses three metrics: overall error, commission error, and omission error. These errors are defined by equations (2), (3), and (4) in the context. Commission error is the ratio of false positives (FP) to the sum of true positives (TP) and false positives. Omission error is the ratio of false negatives (FN) to the sum of true positives and false negatives.

The training process is evaluated for three different models: GPU_I, GPU_Z, and PC_I. These models are trained using incremental training mode on a GPU server, zero-start training model on a GPU server, and incremental training mode on a desktop PC, respectively. The training sample size varies from 20% to 80% of the BMXSM dataset.

In summary, the training of the models is considered complete when the loss rate is less than the preset threshold ɛ. The performance of the models is evaluated using three error metrics, and the time cost of training is also taken into account. The training process is compared for three different models and various training sample sizes.
