Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study used pixel-level annotation or image segmentation for the training samples dataset.

In the process of mapping burned areas, the researchers collected spectral training samples of burned and non-burned areas for the entire study area. These samples were well distributed in space, indicating that they were manually labeled and selected from different locations within the Cerrado biome.

Although the context does not specify the exact annotation technique, the use of pixel-level annotation can be inferred from the fact that the deep learning models were trained to differentiate spectral signatures of burned and unburned areas. This suggests that each pixel in the satellite images was assigned a label indicating whether it belongs to a burned or non-burned area.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the study likely used pixel-level annotation or image segmentation as the data annotation technique in the deep learning pipeline.
