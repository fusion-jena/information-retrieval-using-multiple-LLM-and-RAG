Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models in image processing, including the utilization of neural networks, optimization algorithms, and a compact network with a non-local layer. However, it does not explicitly list the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.

Commonly used hyperparameters in deep learning models include the learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, and activation functions. The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. Optimizers such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Gradient (AdaGrad), Root Mean Square Prop (RMSProp), and Adam are used to update the parameters of the model.

In the given context, it is mentioned that optimization algorithms are employed to assess each parameter's contribution to feature representations. Specifically, Adam is used in the proposed method for training the compact network. However, other hyperparameters are not specified.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can only confirm that the Adam optimizer is used in the deep learning model. The other hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, and activation functions, are not mentioned and cannot be determined from the given information.
