Answer: The provided context discusses two specific models, PConv networks and classification networks, and the preprocessing steps involved before training them.

For PConv networks, the input images are preprocessed by mean centering the image with ImageNet values and then rescaling between 0 and 1. Mean centering is a technique to normalize the data by subtracting the mean value from each data point. In this case, the mean value is obtained from the ImageNet dataset. Rescaling, on the other hand, is a technique to transform the data to a common scale, usually between 0 and 1, to make the learning process more efficient.

Similarly, for the classification networks, the input images are preprocessed by mean centering the image with ImageNet values and then rescaling between 0 and 1. Additionally, various data augmentation techniques such as height and width shift, flipping, zooming, and brightness changes are applied during training. Data augmentation is a technique to increase the amount of training data by applying random transformations to the existing data, which helps improve the model's ability to generalize.

In summary, the preprocessing steps involved before training deep learning models include mean centering, scaling, and data augmentation. Mean centering and scaling are used to normalize and transform the data to a common scale, while data augmentation is used to increase the amount of training data and improve the model's ability to generalize.
