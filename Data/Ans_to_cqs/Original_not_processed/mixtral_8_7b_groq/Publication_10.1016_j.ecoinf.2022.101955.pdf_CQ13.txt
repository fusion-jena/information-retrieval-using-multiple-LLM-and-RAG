Answer:::
The provided context discusses the use of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the ANN model, such as the learning rate or optimizer.

The context does mention that the "nnet" package was used for implementing the ANN model, and that the primary model tuning parameters were size and decay. However, these parameters are related to the complexity of the model and regularization, not the learning process.

In general, ANN models have several hyperparameters that can be adjusted for optimization, including:

1. Learning rate: This determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function.
2. Optimizer: This is a method used to update the weights and biases in the network based on the gradient of the loss function. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.
3. Number of hidden layers and neurons: These parameters determine the complexity of the model and its capacity to learn.
4. Activation function: This function is applied to the output of each neuron to introduce non-linearity into the model.
5. Batch size: This is the number of samples used in one iteration of gradient descent.
6. Regularization parameters: These parameters control overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function.

Based on the provided context, we cannot determine the specific hyperparameters used in the ANN model for LULC classification. It is possible that the authors used default values or did not report these values in their study.
