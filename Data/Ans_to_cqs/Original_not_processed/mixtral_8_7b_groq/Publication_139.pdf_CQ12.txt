Answer:::

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is mentioned in the context when it describes the construction of a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) using the Python package Keras with a Tensorflow backend. The network consists of four convolutional layers, each with a 3 Ã— 3 kernel. The first two layers have 64 filters, while the latter two have 128 filters. Following each convolution block, a batch normalization layer and max pooling layer are applied.

The use of a CNN model is further supported by the context when it mentions the pre-training of models such as ResNet50 and Inception, which are both CNN architectures. However, it was found that pre-training on these models did not significantly improve the classification performance. Therefore, a simpler CNN architecture, similar to those implemented by Ruff et al., 2020; Sprengel et al., 2016, was used instead.

Furthermore, the context also describes the use of Hyperopt for optimizing the network parameters. Hyperopt compares the results of training the network on different combinations of parameters using an oriented random search. This process is typically used for optimizing CNN architectures.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
