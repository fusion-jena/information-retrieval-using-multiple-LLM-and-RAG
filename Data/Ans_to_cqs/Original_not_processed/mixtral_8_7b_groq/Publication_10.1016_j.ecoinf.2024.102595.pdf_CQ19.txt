Answer:::
The specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models in the research study titled "Predicting oil palm yield using a comprehensive agronomy dataset and 17 machine learning and deep learning models" are not explicitly mentioned in the provided abstract. However, it is mentioned that 17 machine learning and deep learning models were used, and TensorFlow and PyTorch are two of the most commonly used frameworks for developing deep learning models. Therefore, it is possible that one or both of these frameworks were used in this research, but more information from the full article would be needed to confirm this.
