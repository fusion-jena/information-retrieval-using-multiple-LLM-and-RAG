I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the proposed model, SeedNet, and its performance comparison with other networks and traditional machine learning methods for seed image classification and retrieval tasks. However, it does not offer information about the code repository or its location, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. I hope this clarifies the situation, and I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
