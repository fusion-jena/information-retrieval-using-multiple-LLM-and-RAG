Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It is possible that the model was developed and tested in a local computing environment rather than on a cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. The focus of the study seems to be more on the development of the deep learning model for water contamination analysis in IoT-enabled aquaculture, rather than on the specifics of its deployment.
