Answer:::
The deep learning model in this study is trained on a computer running a 64-bit Linux operating system, equipped with two 2.3 GHz Intel 8-core processors. However, the specific information about the use of hardware accelerators such as GPUs or TPUs for training the deep learning model is not provided in the context. It is mentioned that the deep learning model is implemented in Python and the GRU-DNN implementation is performed using an unspecified library. Therefore, it is unknown whether specialized hardware resources like GPUs or TPUs were used for training the deep learning model.
