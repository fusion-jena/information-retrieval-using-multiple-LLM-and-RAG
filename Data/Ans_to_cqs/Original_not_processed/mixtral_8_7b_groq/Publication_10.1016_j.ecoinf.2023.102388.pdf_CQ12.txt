Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the VGG16 architecture. This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of the VGG16 architecture consisting of five sets of convolutional layers alternating with five max-pooling layers, followed by two fully connected layers and an output layer. The convolutional layers are a key component of CNNs, and the VGG16 architecture is a well-known and widely used CNN architecture. Furthermore, the context mentions the use of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for optimization, which is a common optimization algorithm used for training CNNs. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN.
