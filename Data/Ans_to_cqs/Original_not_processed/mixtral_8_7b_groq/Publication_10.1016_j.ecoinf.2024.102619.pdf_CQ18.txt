Answer:

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using cross-validation and tracking the training accuracy. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a model will generalize to an independent data set. It is performed by dividing the data into k subsets or folds, where k-1 folds are used for training, and the remaining fold is used for testing. This process is repeated k times, with a different fold used for testing each time. The mean cross-validation (CV) accuracy is then calculated by averaging the testing accuracy from each fold. This value gives an estimate of the model's ability to generalize to new data.

In addition to cross-validation, the training accuracy is also tracked during the training process. The training accuracy is the percentage of images in the training set that are correctly classified by the model. By monitoring the training accuracy, it is possible to see how well the model is learning the training data. If the training accuracy is not improving or is only improving slightly, it may indicate that the model is overfitting to the training data or that the learning rate is too low.

The provided context also mentions the use of hyperparameters, such as C, γ, and learning rate, which are used to control the model's behavior during training. The values of these hyperparameters can be tuned to optimize the model's performance. The mean CV accuracy and training accuracy are both used to evaluate the effect of different hyperparameter values and to select the best set of hyperparameters for the model.

It is also worth noting that the time required for training and testing the model is found to be equivalent between the two classification approaches, but it varies with hardware. Using a GPU completed the testing phase, on average, 0.87 ( ± 0.7) minutes faster across both methods. This suggests that the use of more powerful hardware can also help to monitor the model performance during training by reducing the time required for each training iteration.

In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using cross-validation, tracking the training accuracy, tuning the hyperparameters, and using appropriate hardware. These techniques help to ensure that the model is learning effectively and generalizing well to new data.
