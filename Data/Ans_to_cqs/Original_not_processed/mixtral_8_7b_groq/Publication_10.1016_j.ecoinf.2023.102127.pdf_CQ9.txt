Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of a data repository for the deep learning pipeline in the ibis.iSDM package. The package is designed to create less biased representations of a species niche while accounting for some of the biases that plague biodiversity datasets. It also includes a deep learning pipeline, but the context does not specify where the data for this pipeline is stored or shared.

The package does mention that there may not be enough data available to fit every type of model, and computation time can be a limitation, especially for more demanding Bayesian models. The package will raise warnings and highlighted messages if the provided information is not sufficient for inferring a species distribution.

The authors have provided a link to the package's documentation, which includes a full list of all functions and examples (<https://iiasa.github.io/ibis.iSDM/>). However, this documentation does not appear to include information on a data repository for the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot determine where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline in the ibis.iSDM package is available.
