Answer:::
The provided context does not offer specific details about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. However, it does offer insights into the general considerations when working with deep learning models.

Firstly, deep learning models typically demand substantial computational resources, such as GPUs or TPUs, and involve lengthier training times compared to models like XGBoost (Wu et al., 2021). This suggests that the deployment process might involve setting up a suitable environment with the necessary hardware or cloud-based services to handle these demands.

Secondly, the context highlights that deep learning models are often less interpretable than models like XGBoost, which offers feature importance scores and decision rules (Joshi et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2021). This could imply a need for additional steps in the deployment process to help interpret and explain the deep learning model's predictions, such as using techniques like Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) or Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP).

Thirdly, the performance of deep learning models is highlighted as being particularly effective with larger datasets (Wu et al., 2021; Khruschev et al., 2022). Therefore, the data used for training the model and its deployment should be carefully managed and prepared, ensuring it is available in the deployed environment.

Lastly, the context discusses the use of deep learning models in the field of remote sensing, specifically for Solar-Induced Fluorescence (SIF) retrievals (Frankenberg et al., 2011; Crisp et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2017). In this context, the deployment process might involve integrating the model into a larger system for processing and analyzing satellite data, taking into account the high sensitivity of SIF retrievals to additional offsets in radiances.

Therefore, while the specifics of deploying a trained deep learning model are not provided, the context suggests that the process would involve setting up a suitable computational environment, considering interpretability, managing and preparing training data, and potentially integrating the model into a larger system for data processing and analysis.
