The provided context discusses the use of public datasets, specifically the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) repositories, in a study related to marine fish occurrences. However, it does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting the raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

The raw data in this study comes from existing public databases (GBIF and OBIS) that have collected data through various sources such as surveys, sensors, and other data collection methods. The study then applies a series of filters to enhance the quality and reliability of the information. These filters include removing records with missing values, removing duplicate records, and retaining taxonomic information down to the species level.

The context also mentions the use of "different weighting schemes for records in areas with sufficient sampling" to interpret biodiversity patterns and reduce biases. This suggests that the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline may include various sampling methods with different levels of intensity and coverage.

In addition, the study analyzes the potential effect of body size, habitat depth, and commercial use on the representation of marine fish occurrences in the global database repositories. This analysis implies that the raw data used in the study includes information about these attributes, which could have been collected through various methods such as direct measurements, observations, or data from sensors.

Overall, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that the data comes from existing public databases that have collected data through various sources such as surveys, sensors, and other data collection methods. The study then applies a series of filters to enhance the quality and reliability of the information.
