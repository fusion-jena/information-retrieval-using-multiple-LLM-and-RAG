Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context contains details about the dataset used for training a deep learning model to classify pollen species, but it does not specify where the dataset or the code for the deep learning pipeline can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
