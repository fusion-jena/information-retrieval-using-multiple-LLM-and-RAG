Based on the provided context, the text does not discuss specific strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does provide information about how randomness is managed in the random forests classifier, which is a type of machine learning algorithm.

In the random forests classifier, randomness is introduced in two ways. First, at each split in the tree, a random subset of possible values is considered to determine the split point. This helps to reduce overfitting and improve the accuracy of the model. Second, when building each tree, a different bootstrapped sample is drawn from the training data. This means that each tree is trained on a different subset of the data, which helps to increase the diversity of the trees in the forest and further reduce overfitting.

In addition, when constructing the rule at each branch of the tree, only a single variable threshold is considered, rather than using all correlated predictors. This helps to ensure that the trees in the forest are not too similar to each other, which could lead to overfitting.

It's worth noting that these strategies for managing randomness in the random forests classifier are different from the strategies typically used in deep learning pipelines. In deep learning, randomness is often introduced through techniques such as dropout, which randomly sets a fraction of the weights in a layer to zero during training. This helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons in the network.

Another way to introduce randomness in deep learning is by using different initialization values for the weights in the network. This helps to ensure that the network converges to a different local minimum each time it is trained, which can improve the generalization performance of the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, it does provide information about how randomness is managed in the random forests classifier. Deep learning pipelines typically use different strategies for managing randomness, such as dropout and weight initialization.
