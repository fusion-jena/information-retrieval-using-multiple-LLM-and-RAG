The provided context does not give information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the use of deep learning techniques for individual identification of birds, specifically sociable weavers, great tits, and zebra finches. It explains how large datasets can be collected using RFID technology and how Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be trained for individual re-identification.

The authors discuss the challenges of collecting training data, such as the arrival of new individuals and the need for human observers to label the pictures. They also mention the importance of having enough training data to optimize the performance of CNNs and identify the relative performance of alternative solutions.

However, the text does not mention any details about the deployment platform for the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
