Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection to address data bias during the pre-processing phase of the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the data is split into larger blocks for cross-validation and then further divided into smaller areas of 80 Ã— 80 pixels due to limitations in the available data. This could be a form of data splitting that helps to ensure a certain level of representation from different areas or classes, but it is not explicitly stated as a bias-addressing technique.

In the context, the focus is more on preventing overfitting and increasing model stability during training. To achieve this, techniques such as random selection of samples for validation, dropout, and ADAM optimization with a cross-entropy loss function are used.
