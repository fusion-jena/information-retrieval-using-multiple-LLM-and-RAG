Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline in the context provided primarily uses image files as the data format. The Pl@ntNet classifier, a key component of this pipeline, is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data, which consists of image files. These images are used for training the model to classify and identify plant species. The classifier returns a list of likely species associated with classification scores and matching images retrieved from the database. The 'plantnet' R-package, developed to facilitate future studies, also accepts and processes image files in its interface with the Pl@ntNet API. Therefore, the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image files as the data format. Audio, video, and CSV files are not explicitly mentioned as being used in this pipeline.
