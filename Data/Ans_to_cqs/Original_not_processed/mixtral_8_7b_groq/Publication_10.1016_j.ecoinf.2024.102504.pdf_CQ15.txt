Answer:::

The pieces of context provided do not contain specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for air quality prediction. However, some of the sources mention the use of deep learning models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for predicting air quality parameters.

In general, optimization techniques are crucial in training deep learning models as they help minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance. Some commonly used optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop).

For instance, in the study by Gokul et al. (2023), the LSTM deep learning model outperformed other machine learning models in predicting PM2.5 levels. Although the study does not mention the specific optimization technique used, it is likely that they used one of the standard optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam.

Therefore, while the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for air quality prediction are not mentioned in the provided context, it is common practice to use optimization techniques such as SGD, Adam, or RMSprop in training deep learning models.
