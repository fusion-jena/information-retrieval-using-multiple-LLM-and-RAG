Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the machine learning (ML) model were optimized. The text discusses the use of a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) to evaluate the effects of ML model performance on tagging efficiency, but it does not mention any specific techniques for hyperparameter tuning such as grid search, random search, or others.

However, it is important to note that hyperparameter tuning is a crucial step in building a machine learning model, as it can significantly impact the model's performance. Hyperparameters are the parameters of the algorithm that are not learned from the data, such as the learning rate, regularization strength, number of hidden layers, and others.

There are various techniques for hyperparameter tuning, including grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and more. Grid search involves defining a grid of hyperparameter values and training the model for each combination of values. Random search involves randomly selecting hyperparameter values within a defined range and training the model for each selected combination. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic approach to select the most promising hyperparameter values to try next.

Therefore, while the provided context does not mention any specific technique for hyperparameter tuning, it is likely that some method was used to optimize the ML model's hyperparameters. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to this query.
