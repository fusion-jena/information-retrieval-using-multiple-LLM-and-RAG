The provided context does not mention which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The model was implemented using the Caffe framework, and experiments were conducted to measure the top-1 and top-5 accuracy of the model in different scenarios. However, there is no information about the deployment of the model on a cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
