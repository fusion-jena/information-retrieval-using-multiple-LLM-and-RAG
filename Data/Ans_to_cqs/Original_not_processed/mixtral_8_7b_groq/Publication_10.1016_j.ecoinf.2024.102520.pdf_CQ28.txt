The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any cloud platform for deploying such a model. The context focuses on the use of Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands from Google Earth Engine (GEE) for image processing and analysis of soil substrates. Additionally, the text discusses the evaluation of soil and ecological variables using a kriging method and four different models (Gaussian, spherical, exponential, and linear) for analyzing land use.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy a deep learning model, as the context does not provide information on the use of a deep learning model or any cloud platform.
