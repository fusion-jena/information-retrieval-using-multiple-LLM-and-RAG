The provided context discusses the use of deep learning methods, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, it does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

In general, techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain criteria (e.g., class labels) and then ensuring that each subset is represented proportionally in both the training and testing sets.

2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by randomly duplicating instances or using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) that creates synthetic examples.

3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by randomly removing instances or using techniques like NearMiss that removes instances based on distance measures.

4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from various sources, domains, or conditions to ensure that the dataset is representative of the real-world distribution.

In the context of HSI classification, data bias could arise due to the imbalanced distribution of classes in the dataset. To address this, one could use techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling during preprocessing. Additionally, collecting hyperspectral data from various sources, conditions, or geographical locations could help ensure a diverse and representative dataset.

However, the provided context does not mention any specific preprocessing techniques used to address data bias in the HSI classification task.
