Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the described pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This model is a modified version of ResNet50, which is one of the dominant architectures in bioacoustic tasks. CNNs are particularly suitable for this task because they are inspired by the visual cortex and show good performance in recognizing objects in images. In the context of this pipeline, the CNN is used to perform the automatic task of detection and identification of 18 classes in soundscape recordings.

The implemented CNN is organized according to a hierarchy of layers designed for feature extraction based on digital images. The first layers can detect edges, then simple shapes, and deeper layers can learn more complex shapes with a high level of abstraction. This hierarchical feature extraction makes CNNs very effective in identifying patterns in large and complex datasets, such as soundscape recordings.

Furthermore, the pipeline uses transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques with the deep learning model ResNet50, which was pre-trained on ImageNet data. Transfer learning is a technique that enables the efficient construction of a model by transferring knowledge from a similar task to the target task. In this case, the pre-trained ResNet50 model is used as the starting point, and only the feature extraction layers are retained. The superior classification layers are discarded, and two fully connected layers are added to learn new features specific to the target task.

Overall, the use of a CNN in this pipeline is a well-informed choice, given the success of CNNs in image recognition tasks and their increasing use in the bioacoustic domain. The transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques further enhance the model's performance by leveraging the knowledge gained from pre-training on a large and diverse dataset.
