Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the described machine learning (ML) pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The pipeline was designed for ecoacoustic surveillance, which involves large-scale quantification of ecological communities and their habitats using passive acoustic recording equipment. The pipeline's ML component predicts the presence/absence of biotic and anthropogenic sound in every 1-second chunk throughout the audio file, categorizing each chunk into one of four states.

The CNN is a crucial part of the pipeline, as it classifies the input data. The input to the CNN is a 32 × 21 × 4 tensor, and the CNN comprises a series of layers that modify the input data with parameterized mathematical operations optimized to improve classification performance. The CNN's ability to accept inputs with multiple channels of data is exploited in this pipeline, as four spectrograms, each preprocessed using a different normalization strategy, are provided as input to the CNN.

The deep learning model used in this pipeline is a CNN, as confirmed by the specific libraries used for ML and audio processing: Theano v.0.9.0 and lasagne v.0.2 for ML, and librosa v.0.4.2 for audio processing. Convolutional Neural Networks are a type of deep learning model that have shown remarkable success in various applications, including image and speech recognition, and they are particularly suitable for this ecoacoustic surveillance task due to their ability to learn and extract relevant features from the input data automatically.
