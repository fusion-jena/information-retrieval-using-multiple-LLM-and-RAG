The provided context does not give information about the specific platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the comparison of two state-of-the-art classification techniques for large vocabulary bird species classification from flight calls: a dictionary learning method and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with data augmentation. The models were evaluated on a dataset of 5428 flight calls from 43 different species and were compared against a baseline model based on Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).

The CNN model with data augmentation significantly outperformed the MFCC baseline, yielding a mean classification accuracy of 0.94. The text also mentions that the CNN model was implemented using the Theano library, but it does not specify the platform used for deployment.

Answer: The provided context does not give information about the specific platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model.
