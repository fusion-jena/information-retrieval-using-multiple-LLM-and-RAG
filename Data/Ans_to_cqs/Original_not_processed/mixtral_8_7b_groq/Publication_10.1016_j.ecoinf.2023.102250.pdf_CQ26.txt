The provided context does not directly mention the data preprocessing techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it does discuss the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and other techniques used in deep learning pipelines.

The Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) is a method used to enhance the quality and level of detail in generated images by enabling the network to selectively focus on essential parts of the feature map and enhance the weights in specific channels or spatial regions based on calculated attention scores. While CBAM does not directly address data bias during preprocessing, it can help improve the performance of deep learning models by allowing them to focus on the most relevant features of the input data.

The context also mentions the use of spectral normalization, which is a technique used to train stable Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by constraining the spectral norm of the weight matrix of each layer in the discriminator. This approach can help improve the stability of the training process, but it does not directly address data bias during preprocessing.

To address data bias during preprocessing, several techniques can be used, such as:

1. Stratified sampling: This technique involves dividing the dataset into strata based on the relevant variables and then randomly sampling from each stratum to ensure that the training and testing sets have a similar distribution of these variables.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class in the dataset to balance it with the majority class.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class in the dataset to balance it with the minority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from multiple sources or domains to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population and reduces the risk of bias.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, it discusses other methods used in deep learning pipelines, such as CBAM and spectral normalization. To address data bias during preprocessing, techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be used.
