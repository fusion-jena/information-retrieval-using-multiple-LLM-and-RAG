The purpose of the deep learning model in the context provided is not explicitly stated. However, based on the references given, it can be inferred that the deep learning model is used for species distribution modeling (SDM) in ecology.

In SDM, the goal is to find a subset of environmental conditions in certain regions that are similar to those in the locations where the individuals of a species are found. Deep learning models have been applied to study species distribution by fitting a model using a multivariate set of bioclimatic variables associated with the locations of the individuals.

In the study mentioned, UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) is used for dimensionality reduction and visualization of the results from the deep learning model. UMAP is applied to analyze bioclimatic variables and model the distribution of species at a fine resolution. The authors used clustering to identify groups containing species and near background points to highlight how bioclimatic heterogeneity between clusters in the reduced dimension translates to geographic regions.

In another study, Deneu et al. (2022) used tSNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding), another dimensionality reduction technique, to visualize input data and the results of applying a convolutional neural network (CNN) to model the distribution of species at a fine resolution.

Therefore, based on the context provided, the deep learning model is likely used for species distribution modeling, and the purpose of the model is to find a subset of environmental conditions that are similar to those in the locations where the individuals of a species are found. The deep learning model is combined with dimensionality reduction techniques such as UMAP or tSNE to visualize and analyze the results.
