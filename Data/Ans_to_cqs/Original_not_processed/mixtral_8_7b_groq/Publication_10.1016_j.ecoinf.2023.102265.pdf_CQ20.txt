The deep learning model in the study was primarily trained using a CPU, specifically an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9850H with a CPU clock speed of 2.60 GHz. This was used for training an SVM model with extracted background features from ResNet-18/50/101 models.

However, a GPU was also used to compare the training time of the ResNet models and the softmax function. The ResNet models were trained on a GPU, but the specific type of GPU was not mentioned in the provided context. On the other hand, the softmax function took 12 minutes to complete the same task on the GPU, which was significantly longer than the 1.2 minutes it took for the proposed method using ResNet on the CPU.

Therefore, while both CPUs and GPUs were used for training the deep learning model in this study, the CPU was the primary hardware resource used for training the SVM classifier model. A GPU was used for training the ResNet models and comparing the training time of the softmax function, but the specific type of GPU was not mentioned.
