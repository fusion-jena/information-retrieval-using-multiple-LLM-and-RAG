Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix after the model training. However, the text does describe the process of training a model for tree detection using a combination of unsupervised lidar data, self-supervised RGB data, and hand-annotated data in a semi-supervised framework.

The postprocessing steps that can be inferred from the context are:

1. Evaluation of the model's performance: The text mentions that there is an improvement in prediction quality during the training pipeline, which implies that the model's performance is being evaluated at different stages of training.
2. Comparison of the models: The context describes a comparison of the contribution of hand-annotated data when compared to the self-supervised model or the full model combining both self-supervision and hand-annotation data. This suggests that the models are being compared in terms of their performance.
3. Visualization of the model's predictions: The text includes figures that show the model's predictions at different stages of training. These visualizations can be considered as a form of postprocessing as they provide a way to interpret and understand the model's output.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention common postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, it does imply that the model's performance is being evaluated, compared, and visualized after training.
