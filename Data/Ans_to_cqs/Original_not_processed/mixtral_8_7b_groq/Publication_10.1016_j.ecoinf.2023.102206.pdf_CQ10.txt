Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on explaining the novel Intuitionistic Fuzzy Transfer Learning (IFTL) approach for predicting target data labels using a regression model (TUR) and refining them through intuitionistic fuzzification, K-nearest neighbors, and optimal utilization.

The study mentions using three regression models (ELM, GRNN, and SVR) for the TUR model, but it does not specify the implementation details or the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.

If you are interested in the implementation of ELM, GRNN, or SVR, you can look for separate code repositories for these models. However, the specific deep learning pipeline used in this study, including the implementation of IFTL, is not provided in the context.
