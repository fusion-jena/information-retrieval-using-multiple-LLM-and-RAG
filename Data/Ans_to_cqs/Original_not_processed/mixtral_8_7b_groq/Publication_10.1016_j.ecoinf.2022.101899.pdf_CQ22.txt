The provided context does not give specific information about the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model for wildfire event prediction in Australia. However, it does mention that Halgamuge et al. (2020) developed an algorithm to collect data automatically and analyzed six different optimizer models using deep learning technology. They concluded that this approach could predict natural disasters, including wildfire events, by investigating historical environmental conditions before and after wildfires occurred using the deep learning methodology.

In addition, Dowdy (2020) focused on demonstrating a seasonal prediction system for wildfire event prediction in Australia. This measured spatio-temporal variations and seasonality across several datasets and utilized this methodology to predict wildfire events, focusing on the seasonal predictions using the 2019â€“2020 wildfire season as an example and measuring long-term predictions.

The context also provides information on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculation and interpretation. NDVI is a measure of vegetation health, and it is calculated by taking the ratio of the near-infrared (NIR) and red (R) light reflected by the vegetation. Healthy vegetation reflects a higher volume of near-infrared light and a lower volume of visible red light, resulting in a higher NDVI value. Unhealthy vegetation, such as leaf litter, dried bushes, and fallen tree bark, reflects a higher volume of visible red light and a similar or lower volume of near-infrared light, resulting in a lower NDVI value.

The interpretation of NDVI values is also provided, with green indicating high mean NDVI values and red indicating low mean NDVI scores. Dark red colors are associated with negative NDVI values, which are returned only when over water. However, no significant water structures exist in the study area.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific information about the metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model's performance, it does provide information on the data collection, analysis, and interpretation used in the study.
