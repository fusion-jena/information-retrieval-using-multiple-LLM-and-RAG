Answer:::

The generalizability of the deep learning model was addressed through several measures. Firstly, to ensure that the model can accurately classify dams and non-dams in various scenarios, a diverse dataset was used. Specifically, a random subsample of 400 images was taken from a larger dataset of 7362 images, and these were labeled as either "dam" or "not dam." This allowed the model to be trained on a variety of images that it would later encounter in real-world scenarios.

Secondly, transfer learning was utilized by initializing an ImageNet pre-trained ResNet34 model. This provided the model with a strong foundation of features that had already been learned from a large and diverse dataset, allowing it to focus on learning the specific features that distinguish dams from non-dams.

Thirdly, data augmentation was applied using the fastai get\_transforms function. This allowed the model to be trained on a wider variety of images than were present in the original dataset. Specifically, vertical flipping, limiting overexposure, and disabling zooming augmentation were used to create new images that were similar to those in the original dataset but with slight variations. This helped the model to generalize better and avoid overfitting to the training data.

Fourthly, to further prevent overfitting and ensure that the model's performance was not dependent on the specific split of the data, an 80-20% split for training and validation datasets, respectively, was used. This allowed the model to be trained on a large portion of the data while still retaining a separate set of data for validation.

Lastly, the model was trained with a learning rate of 10âˆ’3 for ten epochs, and the batch size was set to 300 images. This allowed the model to learn the features of the data at a steady pace while still being able to make adjustments as necessary.

Therefore, the generalizability of the deep learning model was addressed through a diverse dataset, transfer learning, data augmentation, a training-validation split, and a suitable learning rate and batch size. These measures helped to ensure that the model could accurately classify dams and non-dams in various scenarios and avoid overfitting to the training data.
