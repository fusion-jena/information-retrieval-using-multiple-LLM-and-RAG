Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the authors used the TensorFlow library to implement their convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and one of the key features of TensorFlow is its support for various regularization techniques.

Regularization is a common technique used in deep learning to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on new, unseen data. Regularization adds a penalty to the loss function to discourage the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are L2 regularization and dropout. L2 regularization adds a penalty to the loss function proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which can help prevent overfitting. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are "dropped out" during training, which helps prevent overfitting by making the model less reliant on any single neuron.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used, it is highly likely that the authors used one or both of these techniques to prevent overfitting in their deep learning pipeline.
