The provided context discusses the use of annotated data in the training of deep learning models, with a focus on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the generation of synthetic samples using generative adversarial models. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include:

1. Image labeling: This involves assigning a class label to an entire image. For example, in the context provided, the authors discuss annotating areas of a map as wetlands.
2. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a bounding box around an object of interest in an image and assigning a class label to that object. This is useful for object detection tasks.
3. Semantic segmentation: This is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments, where each segment is a pixel or group of pixels that share the same class label. This is useful for scene understanding tasks.
4. Instance segmentation: This is a more advanced form of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and assigned a unique identifier. This is useful for tasks such as counting objects in an image.

Without more specific information from the provided context, it is difficult to say which of these techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline discussed. However, the authors do mention the use of annotated data and the generation of synthetic samples, which suggests that some form of image labeling or segmentation was used.
