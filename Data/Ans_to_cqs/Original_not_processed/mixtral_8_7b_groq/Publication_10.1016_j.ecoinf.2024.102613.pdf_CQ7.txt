Answer:

The provided context does not contain specific information on the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention the use of both supervised and unsupervised learning methods in data processing, which can provide some insight into the general approach to deep learning model training.

In supervised learning, the data is often split into training, validation, and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's parameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance. The exact criteria for splitting the data can vary, but a common approach is to use 60-70% of the data for training, 10-20% for validation, and 10-20% for testing.

In unsupervised learning, the data is not labeled, so the split between training and testing sets is not as critical. However, the data may still be divided into subsets for the purpose of cross-validation, where the model is trained on one subset and then evaluated on another subset.

In the context of smart farming, the data used for model training may come from various sources, such as farm management information systems, precision agriculture, or agricultural automation and robotics. The data may include information on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, crop yields, and other relevant variables.

The specific criteria for splitting the data would depend on the nature of the data and the goals of the model training. Factors such as the size of the dataset, the degree of variability in the data, and the desired level of accuracy in the model's predictions would all play a role in determining the optimal split.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific criteria for splitting data for deep learning model training, it is common practice in supervised learning to use a training set, validation set, and testing set. In unsupervised learning, cross-validation may be used instead. The specific criteria for splitting the data would depend on the nature of the data and the goals of the model training.
