Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about a data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context consists of various research papers that have used machine learning and deep learning techniques for medicinal plant identification, including Indian Ayurvedic plant species classification. However, none of the papers mentioned provide a link to a data repository for their deep learning pipeline.

The papers do mention the datasets used for their research, which are either self-built or from sources like Mendeley dataset and GSL100. But, they do not provide a link to these datasets or any code repository for their deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I regret to inform you that I could not find an answer to your query using the provided context.
