The provided context does not directly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in landscape photography and planning, which often involves image annotation.

In the context of computer vision and deep learning, data annotation techniques are used to label images or specific parts of images to train CNNs. Some common annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a rectangle around the object of interest in an image. It provides the coordinates of the bounding box, which can be used to train a CNN to detect and classify objects within the box.

2. Instance segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel of an object in an image, providing a precise outline of the object. It is more time-consuming than bounding box annotation but offers better localization and can be used for tasks like object counting or density estimation.

3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling pixels based on the category of the object they belong to, without distinguishing individual instances. It is useful for scene understanding and can provide context for object detection.

4. Landscape metrics: Although not an annotation technique, landscape metrics are often used in conjunction with CNNs for landscape analysis. These metrics can quantify various aspects of a landscape, such as area, volume, and diversity, and can be used to evaluate landscape changes over time.

In the context of landscape photography and planning, annotation techniques can be used to train CNNs for tasks like recognizing and quantifying vegetation, water bodies, or built-up areas. For example, Guo et al. (2023) construct 3D landscape indexes based on oblique photogrammetry, which could involve annotating images to extract relevant features. Similarly, Ho (2023) presents a tool for analyzing visual landscape elements, which might use annotation techniques for training.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention data annotation techniques, it does discuss the use of CNNs in landscape analysis, which often involves annotation techniques like bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation. Additionally, landscape metrics can be used in conjunction with CNNs for landscape evaluation.
