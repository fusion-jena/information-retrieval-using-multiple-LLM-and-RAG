Answer:
The criteria used to split data for deep learning model training typically include creating separate sets for training, testing, and validation. Although the context provided does not directly mention the criteria for splitting data in deep learning models, it does discuss the Empirical Wavelet Transform (EWT) technique used for signal decomposition in data processing. This technique can be relevant in the context of data preprocessing for deep learning models.

In the context of data splitting, the most common criteria are:

1. Train set: This set is used to train the model, allowing it to learn the underlying patterns in the data. Typically, 70-80% of the total data is used for training.

2. Test set: This set is used to evaluate the model's performance after training. It helps to provide an unbiased estimation of the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. Generally, 15-20% of the total data is used for testing.

3. Validation set: This set is used during the training process to validate the model's performance and tune hyperparameters. It is essential to have a separate validation set to avoid overfitting on the training data. In some cases, a portion of the training set is used as the validation set (e.g., 20% of the training set).

In the context of signal decomposition using EWT, the raw signals are broken down into more stationary and regular subseries. This process helps remove irrelevant properties (noise) and isolate relevant components of the signal, increasing the quality of the datasets. Although this process is not directly related to data splitting for deep learning models, it is an essential step in data preprocessing, ensuring the model receives clean and relevant data for training, testing, and validation.

In summary, the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training include creating separate sets for training, testing, and validation. These sets ensure the model's ability to learn from the data, evaluate its performance, and fine-tune its parameters without overfitting. Additionally, data preprocessing techniques like EWT help improve dataset quality by removing noise and isolating relevant components.
