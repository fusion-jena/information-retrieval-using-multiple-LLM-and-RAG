Answer:::

The article by Fairbrass et al. (2019) describes the development of a deep learning model for urban ecoacoustic assessment, but it does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that some measures were taken.

Firstly, the authors used a large-scale acoustic dataset, which likely included a variety of urban environments and a wide range of biotic and anthropogenic sounds. The diversity of the dataset can help improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Secondly, the authors used convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are known for their ability to learn features from raw data without the need for extensive feature engineering. This can help improve the model's generalizability, as it can learn features that are relevant to the task at hand, rather than relying on hand-crafted features that may not be as robust.

Thirdly, the authors used a ML pipeline written in python v.2.7.12 with theano v.0.9.0 and lasagne v.0.2 for ML and librosa v.0.4.2 for audio processing. The use of well-established machine learning libraries and tools can help ensure the reproducibility and generalizability of the model.

Lastly, the authors mention that they applied different normalization strategies to the input data before feeding it into the CNN. Data normalization is a common technique used to improve the generalizability of machine learning models, as it can help ensure that the model is not biased towards certain features or patterns in the training data.

However, it is not clear from the information provided whether the authors used cross-validation or stratified splitting to further evaluate the model's generalizability. These techniques are commonly used to assess the performance of machine learning models and can help ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data.

Answer:::

In summary, while the article by Fairbrass et al. (2019) does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, we can infer that some measures were taken, such as using a diverse dataset, CNNs, well-established machine learning libraries and tools, and data normalization. However, it is not clear whether the authors used cross-validation or stratified splitting to further evaluate the model's generalizability.
