Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses various topics related to image classification, such as the use of softmax and a proposed method on a CPU and GPU, insect microhabitat studies, and manual classification algorithms. However, it does not mention any specific techniques used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search.

Hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in machine learning model development, as it helps to find the best set of parameters for a given model and dataset. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and gradient-based optimization. Grid search involves systematically trying all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a predefined range, while random search selects hyperparameters at random from a specified distribution. Bayesian optimization uses probabilistic models to make informed decisions about which hyperparameters to try next, and gradient-based optimization uses gradient descent algorithms to adjust hyperparameters iteratively.

Without more information, it is difficult to provide a specific answer to the query. However, it is important to note that hyperparameter optimization is a crucial step in developing a machine learning model, and neglecting this step could lead to suboptimal model performance. Therefore, it is recommended to use a systematic approach for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search, to ensure that the model is well-tuned for the given task.
