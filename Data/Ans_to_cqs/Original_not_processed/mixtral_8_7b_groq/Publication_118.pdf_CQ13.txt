Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of auto-encoders for automatic feature extraction in eco-acoustic data analysis, but it does not explicitly mention the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does provide a detailed description of the architecture of the auto-encoder used in the study.

The auto-encoder consists of an encoder and a decoder network. The encoder network has an input layer of size 128x128x3 and four convolutional layers with 3 × 3 pixel kernels, stride of 1 pixel, and zero padding of 1 pixel on each layer except the first. It also has four max-pooling layers with 4 × 4 pixel kernels, stride of 2 pixels, and zero padding of 1 pixel. The output of the encoder network is a flattened feature vector of size 384x1x1.

The decoder network accepts the feature vector produced by the encoder network as its input and consists of four convolutional layers with a 3 × 3 kernel, stride of 1 pixel, and zero padding of 1 pixel on each layer except the last. It also has four max-unpooling layers with 4 × 4 pixel kernels, stride of 2 pixels, and zero padding of 1 pixel, which produces a 128x128x3 output.

The activation function used in the network is a rectified linear unit (ReLU) based function, which helps mitigate the vanishing/exploding gradient problem. The study used both implicit pooling and explicit max-pooling based auto-encoders.

Therefore, while the context does not provide information on the learning rate or optimizer used in the study, it does provide a detailed description of the architecture of the auto-encoder used.
