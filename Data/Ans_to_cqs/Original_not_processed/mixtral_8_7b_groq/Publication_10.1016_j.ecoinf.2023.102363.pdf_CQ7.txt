Answer:

The provided context discusses the data preparation and model fine-tuning process for a deep learning model, but it does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data into training, validation, and test sets. However, it can be inferred that the data is split into two main sets: a base model validation set and a labeled Gulf of Mexico training set.

The base model validation set is used during the fine-tuning of the base model with Gulf of Mexico data. This set is combined with 100 frames per class from the labeled December 3rd 2019 training set, randomly pooled per experiment, to validate the model's performance across both environments simultaneously. This suggests that the base model validation set is used for validation during the fine-tuning process.

The labeled December 3rd 2019 training set is used to create training sets of increasing size (50, 100, 200, 300, and 500-frames) for fine-tuning the base model. An extra training set is also considered, consisting of 500 frames of randomly sampled ambient noise from December 3rd 2019. However, the context does not mention if these sets are used for training, validation, or testing.

Given that the context focuses on the model fine-tuning process and validation, it is likely that the data splitting criteria were not provided as they are standard in most deep learning practices. Typically, the data is split into three sets: training (70-80%), validation (10-15%), and test (10-15%). The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used for hyperparameter tuning and model validation during the training process, and the test set is used for final model evaluation.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it can be inferred that the data is split into a base model validation set and a labeled Gulf of Mexico training set. The standard data splitting criteria in deep learning practices would be to use a portion of the data for training, validation, and testing.
