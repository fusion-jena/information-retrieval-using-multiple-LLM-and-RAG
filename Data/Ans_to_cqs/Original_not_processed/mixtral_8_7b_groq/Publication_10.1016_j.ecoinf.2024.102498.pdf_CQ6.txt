Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that deep learning techniques, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are used for Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classification in a patch-wise manner, utilizing sophisticated features extracted from satellite imagery. This suggests that some form of preprocessing might be applied to the satellite imagery data.

In general, preprocessing steps for deep learning models trained on remote sensing data may include:

1. Data normalization: This process involves scaling the data to a similar range to improve model convergence and stability. Common normalization techniques include min-max scaling, z-score normalization, and decimal scaling.

2. Data cleaning: This step aims to remove noise, correct inconsistencies, and handle missing values in the dataset. For remote sensing data, this might involve removing cloud cover, atmospheric effects, or invalid pixel values.

3. Feature extraction: Deep learning models, especially CNNs, can learn complex features directly from raw data. However, in some cases, domain-specific features might be extracted and used as input. For satellite imagery, these features could be spectral indices, textural features, or shape descriptors.

4. Data augmentation: This technique is used to increase the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations, such as rotation, scaling, or flipping, to the existing data. This can help improve the model's generalization ability and reduce overfitting.

It is important to note that the specific preprocessing steps may vary depending on the dataset, deep learning architecture, and problem at hand. The context provided does not mention any specific preprocessing steps for deep learning models in GEE, so further investigation would be required to provide a definitive answer.
