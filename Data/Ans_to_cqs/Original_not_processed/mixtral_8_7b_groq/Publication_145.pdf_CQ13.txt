Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

1. Binary cross-entropy and Dice coefficient-related loss: The model uses a combination of binary cross-entropy and Dice coefficient-related loss as the loss function for training. The Dice coefficient is a measure of the similarity between two sets, and it is commonly used in image segmentation tasks.

2. Optimizer: The optimizer used in the model is RMSprop, which is an adaptive learning rate method proposed by Geoff Hinton. RMSprop adjusts the learning rate based on the moving average of the squared gradient for each weight.

3. Initial learning rate: The initial learning rate used in the model is 0.0001.

4. Number of epochs: The model was trained for 300 epochs.

5. Batch size: The batch size used in the model is 24 images.

6. Programming language and interface: The model was coded in the programming language R with Rstudio interface to Keras.

7. Deep learning framework: The model was built using TensorFlow backend.

8. Hardware: The training of the models took place on an Nvidia RTX2080 graphics card with 8 GB of dedicated memory.

9. Prediction time: Prediction using GPU of a single tile of 16,384 Ã— 16,384 pixels (approximately 67.10 km2) took approximately 6 minutes.
