Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020). The study discusses the effects of sample size and network depth on a deep learning approach to species distribution modeling, but there is no mention of where the code for the pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
