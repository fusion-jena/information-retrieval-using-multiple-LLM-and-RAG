Answer:::
The code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study mentioned is not explicitly provided in the given context. However, it is mentioned that the CNN was implemented using Keras and TensorFlow software packages implemented in Python. The specific implementation of EfficientNet-B4 used is EfficientNet V1.1.0, which can be found on GitHub (<https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet>). The pre-trained weights used for transfer learning are also available through this API. It is possible that the researchers have used this public implementation and then modified it for their specific task. But, the complete deep learning pipeline code specific to this study is not available publicly in the provided context.
