Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention which framework was used to build the deep learning model. However, it does give some insight into the architecture of the custom D-CNN (CoralNet) used in the proposed BoF based framework. The CoralNet model has thirteen layers, including convolutional layers (Conv2D), max-pooling layers (MaxPooling2D), dense layers, a flatten layer, and activation layers using rectified linear unit (ReLU) and softmax functions. The training parameters for CoralNet include the Adam optimizer, 10 epochs, a batch size of 64, and cross-entropy as the loss function.

The context also mentions that the model was trained with 15k images of bleached and unbleached corals from the Great Barrier Coral Reef of Australia. The SVM classifier was employed to categorize the features extracted through D-CNN and handcrafted descriptors. The basic steps involved in the proposed methodology are extracting a patch from the coral reef image, extracting texture and color features with handcrafted descriptors, extracting spatial features with D-CNN models, concatenating these Bags of Features (BoF) to form a visual vocabulary (VV) vector, and providing it as input to the classifier.

While the context does not explicitly mention any deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, it is likely that one of these popular frameworks was used to build the deep learning model, considering their widespread use and extensive support for custom model architectures and training configurations.
