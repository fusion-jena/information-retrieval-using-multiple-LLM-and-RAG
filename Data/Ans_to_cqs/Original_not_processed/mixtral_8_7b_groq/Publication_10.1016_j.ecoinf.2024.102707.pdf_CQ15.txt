Answer:::

The provided context includes several studies that use deep learning for counting or surveying animals, particularly in Antarctica. However, none of the given sources explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in their deep learning pipelines.

Optimization techniques are crucial in training deep learning models as they help minimize the loss function and improve model performance. Common optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, and Adam.

While the specific optimization techniques are not mentioned, some of the papers do provide information about the deep learning architectures and tools they used. For instance, Le et al. (2022) used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for seabird colony surveys, and Liu et al. (2020) explored efficient machine learning methods for penguin counting. Peng et al. (2020) used a modified Faster R-CNN for kiang detection in Tibetan plateau. These architectures typically require an optimization technique during training.

Furthermore, some studies used pre-trained models. Moreni et al. (2023) investigated the use of pre-trained neural networks for automated aerial animal detection, and Oosthuizen et al. (2020) and Pfeifer et al. (2021) used Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for surveying Antarctic shags. Pre-trained models often come with pre-determined optimization techniques, which the authors might have used without explicitly mentioning.

In conclusion, while the specific optimization techniques used in the studies mentioned in the context are not provided, it is highly likely that they used common optimization techniques such as SGD, Adagrad, Adadelta, or Adam, either explicitly or as part of pre-trained models.
