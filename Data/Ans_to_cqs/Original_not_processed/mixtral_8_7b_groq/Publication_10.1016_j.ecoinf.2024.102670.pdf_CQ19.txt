Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of which deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used in the study. The focus of the text is on the application of deep learning techniques for the analysis of filamentous organisms, specifically the Rhizophagus irregularis. It discusses the methods used for data preparation, such as obtaining ground truth data through crowd-sourcing and calculating filament lengths. It also explains the visualization of network structures and the prediction of angular branching processes in the thallus growth of Podospora anserina. However, it does not specify the deep learning framework utilized in the study. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question without additional information.
