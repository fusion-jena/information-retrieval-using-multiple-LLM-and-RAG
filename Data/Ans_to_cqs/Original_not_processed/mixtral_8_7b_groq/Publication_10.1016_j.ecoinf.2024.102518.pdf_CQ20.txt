Answer:::
The provided context does not contain information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It focuses on the methodology and evaluation of a species distribution model for Asian elephants, including the use of feature classes, regularization multipliers, and metrics like delta.AICc, Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), and Continuous Boyce Index (CBI). The model's final optimal parameters were identified as the feature class 'LQP' and a regularization multiplier of 3.5. However, it does not mention any details about the hardware resources employed in the training process.
