Answer:::

The deep learning model used for highway air quality monitoring and prediction employed several hyperparameters to optimize its performance. The specific hyperparameters used include the learning rate and the optimizer.

The learning rate is a critical hyperparameter that determines the size of the steps taken during the optimization process. In this study, the learning rate was determined through a series of experiments on popular optimization functions such as SGD, RMSProp, LAMB, LARS, and Adam. Ultimately, the learning rate was fixed at 0.001, which was the point where the plot started dipping in the training loss against the learning rate figure.

The optimizer is another essential hyperparameter that determines the algorithm used for optimization. In this study, the Adam optimizer was used, which is a popular optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of two other optimization algorithms, Adagrad and RMSProp. The Adam optimizer was selected based on its ability to adaptively adjust the learning rate during the optimization process, which helps to improve the model's convergence and accuracy.

In summary, the deep learning model used in this study employed a learning rate of 0.001 and the Adam optimizer as its hyperparameters. These hyperparameters were selected based on their ability to optimize the model's performance and improve its accuracy in predicting highway air quality.
