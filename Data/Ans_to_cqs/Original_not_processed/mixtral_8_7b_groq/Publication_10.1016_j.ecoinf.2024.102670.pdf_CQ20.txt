Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mainly focuses on the methods and techniques used for image analysis and processing in various fields such as karyotyping, brain microvasculature, and fungal thallus growth.

However, it is mentioned that deep learning models have outperformed other methods in several domains, and a Convolutional Neural Network-based segmentation model was developed and compared with other methods. It is common practice to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to accelerate the training of deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel computations. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that such hardware resources were used for training the deep learning models mentioned in the context.

Answer::: 

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models, it is common practice to use GPUs or TPUs for this purpose.
