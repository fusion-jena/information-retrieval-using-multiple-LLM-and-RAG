Answer:::
The deep learning model was constructed using the Python package Keras with a Tensorflow backend. This information is provided in section 2.5 of the context, which discusses the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture used for classifying spectrograms. It is specified that Keras, a popular high-level neural networks API, was used to build the CNN, and Tensorflow, an open-source platform for machine learning, was employed as the backend. This combination of Keras and Tensorflow allowed for the efficient development and training of the deep learning model.
