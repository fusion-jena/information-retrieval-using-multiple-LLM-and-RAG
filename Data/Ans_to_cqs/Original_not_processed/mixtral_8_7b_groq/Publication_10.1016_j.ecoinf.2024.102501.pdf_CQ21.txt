Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context mainly focuses on the data and test environment, model performances, and the comparison of different models. However, it does mention the calculation of certain metrics such as R-squared (R2), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) during the training and validation phases of the models.

In the table provided, the R2, MSE, and MAE values are calculated for both the training and validation sets of various models, including SVR1, SVR2, SVR3, WTD-SVR1, WTD-SVR2, WTD-SVR3, LSTM1, LSTM2, LSTM3, BPNN1, BPNN2, and BPNN3. The bold values in the table represent the best evaluation results for each algorithm.

Therefore, based on the given context, the postprocessing steps after model training include the calculation of R-squared, Mean Squared Error, and Mean Absolute Error. However, there is no information about other postprocessing techniques such as Saliency maps or Confusion matrix.
