Answer:::
The covsel R package, which is a two-step "embedded" covariate selection procedure for species distribution models (SDMs), uses data frames and numeric vectors as its primary data formats. Specifically, the covsel.embed() function requires a data frame (covdata) containing continuous covariate data and a numeric vector (pa) of species presences (1) and absences (0). An optional numeric vector (weights) with the weights for each value in pa can also be provided. Additionally, the wrapper function covsel.filter() requires a correlation coefficient threshold (corcut) for identifying collinearity.

However, the provided context does not mention any use of image, audio, or video data formats in the deep learning pipeline of the covsel R package. It appears that the package primarily works with tabular data (data frames) and presence-absence data (numeric vectors).

It's worth noting that the covsel R package is designed for collinearity-filtering algorithm and model-specific embedded regularization techniques in the context of SDMs. Therefore, it may not be directly applicable to other deep learning pipelines that require image, audio, or video data formats.

In summary, the covsel R package primarily uses data frames and numeric vectors as its data formats, and there is no mention of image, audio, or video data formats in the provided context.
