Answer:::

The provided context does not include information on the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline of the study by Huang et al., 2019.

The study by Huang et al., 2019 focuses on monitoring ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen by the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning. However, the context does not provide details on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning model.

Optimization techniques are crucial in deep learning as they help to minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance. Some of the commonly used optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad.

Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer to the query.
