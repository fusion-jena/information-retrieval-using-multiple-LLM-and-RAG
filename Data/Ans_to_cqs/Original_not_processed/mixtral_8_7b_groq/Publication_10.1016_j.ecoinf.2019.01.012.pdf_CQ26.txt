The provided context discusses the use of deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for image classification. It explains how these models learn and extract relevant features from large quantities of labeled training data, without the need for manual feature extraction. The context also describes the authors' decision to train their CNN from scratch, using a specific activation function and optimizer, on a large dataset of nearly 30,000 labeled samples per class. However, the context does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

Data bias can occur when the training data is not representative of the overall population, leading to poor model performance on certain subgroups. To address data bias, several preprocessing techniques can be used, such as:

1. Stratified sampling: This technique involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain characteristics (e.g., age, gender, race), and then ensuring that each subgroup is proportionally represented in the training, validation, and test sets.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of samples from underrepresented subgroups in the training data, either by duplicating existing samples or generating synthetic samples.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of samples from overrepresented subgroups in the training data, either by randomly selecting a subset of samples or using techniques such as Tomek links.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves actively collecting data from a wide range of sources and subgroups to ensure that the training data is representative of the overall population.

These techniques can help to ensure that the deep learning model is trained on a diverse and representative dataset, reducing the risk of data bias and improving the model's performance on underrepresented subgroups. However, the provided context does not mention the use of any of these techniques in the preprocessing of their deep learning pipeline.
