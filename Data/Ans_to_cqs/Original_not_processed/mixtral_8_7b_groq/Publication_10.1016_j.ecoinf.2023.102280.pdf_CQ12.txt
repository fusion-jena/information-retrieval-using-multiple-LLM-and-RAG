Answer:::
The type of deep learning models used in the pipeline for deep noise reduction in bioacoustics applications include U-net architecture, transformer attention mechanisms, and temporal frequency convolutional networks.

The U-net architecture is commonly used in deep noise reduction methods and consists of an encoder and decoder section (Xie et al., 2021). The encoder produces a compressed latent space representation, while the decoder uses this latent space to reconstruct the denoised waveform.

Recently, transformer attention mechanisms have been applied with great success in deep noise reduction methods (Cao et al., 2022; Luo and Mesgarani, 2019, 2023; Zhang et al., 2022; Zhao et al., 2022). These mechanisms allow the model to focus on relevant features in the input data, improving the denoising performance.

Additionally, temporal frequency convolutional networks with axial attention have been proposed for speech enhancement (Zhang et al., 2022). These networks use convolutional layers to capture local temporal and frequency information, while axial attention mechanisms allow the model to capture long-range dependencies in the input data.

It is worth noting that most deep noise reduction methods focus on NLP applications and are optimized for bandwidths ranging from 16 to 22 kHz (Stowell, 2021). However, bioacoustics applications commonly exceed this bandwidth, and the sparsity of vocalisations makes the development of large-scale datasets infeasible. Therefore, the selection of appropriate deep learning models and the generation of training data for fine-tuning are crucial for the success of deep noise reduction methods in bioacoustics applications.
