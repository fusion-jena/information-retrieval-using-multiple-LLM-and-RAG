Based on the provided context, there is no clear information that specifies the platform used to deploy the deep learning model for land use and land cover (LULC) classification.

The sources mention the use of deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for LULC classification. However, they do not mention the specific cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform) utilized for deploying these models.

Anjos, M., Lopes, A., Alves, E., Correia, E., Mendonça, F., (2021) discuss urban planning and climatic guidelines in north-eastern coast of Brazil, but there is no mention of deep learning model deployment platforms. Similarly, Ovalle, A., Trist´an, A., Amador-Nieto, J., Putri, R., Zahra, R., (2021) analyze the influence of LULC on land surface temperature in San Luis Potosí Basin, Mexico, but do not provide information on the platform used for their deep learning models.

Javad, White, L., Banks, S., Montgomery, J., Hopkinson, C., (2019) create a Canadian wetland inventory using Google Earth Engine, but it is unclear if this platform was used for deep learning model deployment or solely for data processing.

In summary, while the sources discuss the use of deep learning techniques for LULC classification, there is no clear information on the cloud platform used for deploying these models.

Answer:::
Answer: The provided context does not contain information on the platform used to deploy the deep learning model for land use and land cover classification.
