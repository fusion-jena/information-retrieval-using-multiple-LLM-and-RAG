Based on the provided context, there is no information about training or deploying a deep learning model. The text describes a methodology for creating a fuzzy inference system (FIS) to determine the suitability of landscapes for apis (honeybees) based on expert data and field survey data. The FIS model is implemented using the fuzzy logic toolbox of Matlab 2023b.

The process followed for creating the FIS model includes:

1. Defining the input and output variables: The input variables are LCWTSuit (landcover and wildland type suitability) and DistSuit (distance suitability), and the output variable is ApisSuit (apis suitability).
2. Creating the membership functions for the input and output variables.
3. Defining the rules for the FIS model.
4. Validating the FIS model using the InVEST model, the ecosystem services mapping on European scale model, PollMap, and the potential for pollination services.

Therefore, the provided context does not contain information on the process followed to deploy a deep learning model.
