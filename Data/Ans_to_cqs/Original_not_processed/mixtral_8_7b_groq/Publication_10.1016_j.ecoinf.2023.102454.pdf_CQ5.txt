Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the datasets used in the study are not specifically mentioned as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for image recognition tasks. Instead, this study uses a combination of nighttime lighting data, provincial and municipal statistical energy data, and carbon emission factors for various energy sources.

The nighttime lighting data is extended NPP-VIIRS-like NTL Data for the years 2000-2021, obtained from the National Earth System Science Data Centre. This dataset is used to represent the temporal changes in population and light intensity at various scales.

Provincial statistical energy data for 2000-2021 are obtained from the China Statistical Yearbook, while municipal statistical data are obtained from the Xi'an Statistical Yearbook. These datasets provide information on energy consumption in different regions.

Carbon emission factors for various energy sources are obtained from the "2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventory". These factors are used to estimate the carbon emissions associated with energy consumption.

Additionally, administrative boundary data for Xi'an (district, county, and street administrative boundaries) are provided by the National Basic Geographic Information System. These datasets are used to define the spatial boundaries of the study area.

Overall, while these datasets may not be as well-known as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning community, they are well-suited to the specific research question of estimating carbon emissions at a fine-scale regional level.
