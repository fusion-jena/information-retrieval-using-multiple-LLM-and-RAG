The context does not provide specific information about the deep learning framework used to build the models for bat acoustic signal detection. The text mentions the use of deep learning tools and techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM), but it does not specify the framework in which these models were implemented. Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to give a definitive answer to the query.
