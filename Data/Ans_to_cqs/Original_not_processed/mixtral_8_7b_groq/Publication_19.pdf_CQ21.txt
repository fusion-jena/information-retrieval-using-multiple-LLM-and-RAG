Based on the provided context, there are a few postprocessing steps mentioned after the model training.

Answer:
After the model training, the first step mentioned is the conversion of the best trained Inception-V3 model to TensorFlow Lite. This results in a reduced model size, but with a slight reduction in accuracy and F1-score. The F1-score for all classes except 'other' remains above 0.92. The F1-score of 'other' is reduced to 0.71 (from 0.79). 

Next, a confusion matrix is created for the TensorFlow Lite Inception-V3 model. The confusion matrix is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. It's especially useful for understanding how well a classification algorithm is performing. The matrix itself is relatively simple to understand: it's a 2D table that shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

Lastly, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are plotted for the TensorFlow Lite model. ROC curves are a graphical representation of the performance of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The curve is created by plotting the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold settings.

It's important to note that there's no mention of saliency maps in the provided context. Saliency maps are a way of visualizing the parts of an input that are most important to a model's prediction. They're often used in image classification tasks to understand which parts of an image the model is focusing on.

In summary, after the model training, the postprocessing steps involved include the conversion of the model to TensorFlow Lite, creation of a confusion matrix, and plotting of ROC curves.
