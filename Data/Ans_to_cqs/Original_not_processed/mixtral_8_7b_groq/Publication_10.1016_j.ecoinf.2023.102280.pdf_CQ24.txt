Answer:

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning techniques for noise reduction in bioacoustic applications, but it does not directly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of randomly sampled noise for generating training data.

To approximate "clean" ground-truth data, noise is removed from the signal using spectral subtraction and then randomly sampled noise is superimposed onto the ground-truth to generate the noisy input. This is done using a dataset containing 963 five-second noise samples collated from field recordings. The samples contain both stationary background noise and non-target transient noise features including rain, wind gusts, vehicles, banging, etc.

This strategy of using randomly sampled noise for training data generation introduces a form of randomness in the deep learning pipeline. The random sampling of noise ensures that the model is exposed to a variety of noise profiles during training, which can help improve its ability to generalize to new, unseen noise profiles in real-world applications.

Additionally, the use of a random seed value in the deep learning pipeline can help ensure the reproducibility of the training process. By setting a fixed random seed value, the same sequence of random numbers will be generated each time the training process is run, which can help ensure that the training results are consistent and reproducible.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of randomly sampled noise for training data generation. This strategy introduces a form of randomness in the pipeline and can help improve the model's ability to generalize to new noise profiles. The use of a fixed random seed value can also help ensure the reproducibility of the training process.
