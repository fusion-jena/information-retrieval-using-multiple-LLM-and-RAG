Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context focuses on the classification methodology in landscape ecology, with detailed equations and processes for sorting and averaging classification values.

However, it is common practice in machine learning, which includes training artificial neural networks, to use a validation loss plateau as a criterion for determining when training is complete. This means that training continues until the validation loss stops decreasing or reaches a minimum value, indicating that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data and is not overfitting.

Therefore, while the provided context does not specifically mention this criterion, it is still a likely candidate for determining when training is complete in the context of machine learning and artificial neural networks.
