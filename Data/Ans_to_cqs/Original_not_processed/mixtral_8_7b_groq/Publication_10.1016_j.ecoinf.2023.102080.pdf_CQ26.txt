Answer:::
The provided context discusses a two-step "embedded" covariate selection procedure for species distribution models (SDMs) in the context of high-dimensional candidate covariate space. This procedure combines a collinearity-filtering algorithm with three model-specific embedded regularization techniques. However, it does not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

The two-step "embedded" covariate selection procedure consists of two main steps. In Step A, a collinearity-filtering algorithm is applied to remove highly correlated covariates. This helps to reduce the number of candidate covariates and prevent overfitting. The correlation coefficient threshold used for identifying collinearity is determined by the corcut value.

In Step B, three model-specific embedded regularization techniques are applied to select the most relevant covariates for the SDMs. These techniques include generalized linear model with elastic net regularization, generalized additive model with null-space penalization, and guided regularized random forest. These algorithms perform covariate selection at the same time as model fitting, allowing for early consideration of the specificities of the algorithms and the multivariate context. This approach has a more reasonable computational cost and limits overfitting compared to dredging or wrapping techniques, such as backward or forward selection strategies.

The target algorithms cover a gradient of fitting techniques (tree- and regression-based) and flexibility levels (GLM: parametric, GAM: semi-parametric, and RF: machine learning). The resulting covariate selection is generalizable enough to be used as input for other popular SDM algorithms, such as Maxent or Gradient Boosting.

The provided context focuses on the "embedded" covariate selection procedure for SDMs and does not discuss any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
