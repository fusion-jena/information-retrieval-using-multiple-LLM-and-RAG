Answer:::

In the deep learning pipeline for the classification task of identifying the invasive alien species Cortaderia selloana in images, the Adam optimizer algorithm was used for model optimization. The Adam optimizer is a popular optimization technique that combines the advantages of two other optimization methods: AdaGrad and RMSProp. It is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that can handle sparse gradients well and can be used with little memory, making it suitable for large datasets.

In addition to using the Adam optimizer, a batch size of 10 and 100 epochs were used for training the deep learning models. The learning rates were chosen based on empirical trials over 100 epochs, and the best results were obtained with a learning rate of 10 for the EfficientNetB0 and Inception-v3 models.

It is worth noting that before implementing the deep learning models, all images were resized to the same resolution (227x197 pixels) and normalized to the [0,1] range. Six open-source Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were selected for the classification task, including VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0. These models were chosen for their ease of transfer learning and high performance on similar classification tasks.

In summary, the Adam optimizer algorithm was used for model optimization in the deep learning pipeline for identifying Cortaderia selloana in images. Additionally, the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs were carefully chosen based on empirical trials to achieve the best results.
