Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about a code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study "Machine learning for inferring animal behavior from location and movement data" by Guiming Wang. The context includes the article abstract, list of keywords, and references, but there is no mention of a code repository or where the code might be found. It is possible that the code is not publicly available or was not shared as part of this study. If you are interested in the study, I would recommend reaching out to the author, Guiming Wang, for more information.
