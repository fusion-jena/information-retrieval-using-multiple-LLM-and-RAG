Answer:::
The provided context does not specify the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The study mentions the use of data from the third and fourth natural environment surveys and employs seven machine learning models for species distribution analysis. However, it does not mention where the data or the code for the deep learning pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide the required information. I recommend contacting the authors or looking for a supplementary materials section in the publication for more details.
