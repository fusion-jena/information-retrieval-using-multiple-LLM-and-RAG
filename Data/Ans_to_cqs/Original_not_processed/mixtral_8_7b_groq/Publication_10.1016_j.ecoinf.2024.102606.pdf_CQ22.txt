Answer:::

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include Intersection over Union (IoU), mean average precision (mAP), and a precision-recall curve.

Intersection over Union (IoU) is a metric that quantifies the overlap between the annotation and the prediction box. A match is considered if the IoU is 0.5 or more between the prediction and the annotation. If a prediction doesn't match any annotation, it is considered to be a background element.

Mean average precision (mAP) is a metric that gives a score for the whole model, while average precision (AP) gives a score for each species. These metrics are used to analyze which model does best on average for each species and how good it is at predicting each species.

A precision-recall curve is a graph representing the balance between recall and precision, depending on the percentage. It is calculated from precision and recall metrics. Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions, while recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. The higher the precision for a species, the more confident the model is to be correct when predicting it.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model and ensure its ability to reach 95% precision, making it reliable enough to be used by experts in real-life conditions.
