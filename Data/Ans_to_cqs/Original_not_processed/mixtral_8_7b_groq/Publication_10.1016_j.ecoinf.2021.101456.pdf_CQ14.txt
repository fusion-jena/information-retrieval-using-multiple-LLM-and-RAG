The text does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It mentions that the model parameters, including some hyperparameters, were tuned on an independent dataset and found to be robust for the dataset used in the study. However, it does not specify the method used for this tuning, such as grid search, random search, or other optimization techniques.

The dynamic β-VAE model has several tunable model parameters and hyperparameters, including β and γ, which are adjusted dynamically during training. The β dynamics are divided into two regimes, aimed at optimizing reconstruction and regularization terms. The value of β is decreased when the reconstruction loss is increasing and the regularization loss is decreasing, according to specific conditions.

The memory of previous local optima is incorporated into the model through terms associated with all epochs up to the current one. This long-term memory helps the model to steer towards more global optima by balancing the trade-off between long and short-term memory of the losses and their corresponding optima.

While the text provides details about the model's dynamic adjustment of hyperparameters and the role of memory in optimization, it does not explicitly mention the optimization method used for initial hyperparameter selection. Therefore, the answer to the query is:
