I don't have enough information to provide specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, as the text provided focuses on data management and citation in the ESS-DIVE repository. However, I can provide some general context about hyperparameters in deep learning models.

Hyperparameters are crucial configuration variables in deep learning models that influence the training process and the model's performance. Some common hyperparameters include:

1. Learning rate: Controls the size of the steps in the gradient descent optimization process. A learning rate that is too high may cause overshooting and unstable training, while a learning rate that is too low may result in slow convergence.
2. Optimizer: Determines the method used to update the model's weights based on the gradient. Popular optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.
3. Batch size: The number of training examples used in each iteration of the optimization process. Larger batch sizes typically result in faster training but may lead to less accurate models if the batch size is too large.
4. Number of layers and neurons: The architecture of the deep learning model, including the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer, significantly impacts the model's capacity and performance.
5. Regularization techniques: Methods to prevent overfitting, such as L1/L2 regularization or dropout, can be configured using hyperparameters.

These hyperparameters need to be carefully tuned to achieve optimal performance for a specific task and dataset. Grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization are common techniques for hyperparameter tuning.

In the context of the provided text, it highlights the importance of proper citation and data management when using multiple data packages in deep learning models or other data-driven research. Properly citing data sources ensures appropriate credit to data producers and helps other researchers build upon and replicate the work.
