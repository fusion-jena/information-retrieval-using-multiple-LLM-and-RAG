Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a specific code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the methodology and approach used for developing a deep learning pipeline to identify a certain number of classes using a limited amount of labeled images. However, it does not give information about where the actual code for this pipeline is stored or hosted.

It is common practice for researchers to share their code and data through repositories like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. However, this information is not always included in research papers or articles. If the code repository for this deep learning pipeline is not mentioned in the provided context, it is possible that it was not shared publicly.

If you are interested in accessing the code for this deep learning pipeline, I would recommend reaching out to the authors of the research directly. They may be able to provide you with more information about where the code is hosted or how you can access it.

In summary, based on the provided context, there is no mention of a specific code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It is recommended to reach out to the authors for more information.
