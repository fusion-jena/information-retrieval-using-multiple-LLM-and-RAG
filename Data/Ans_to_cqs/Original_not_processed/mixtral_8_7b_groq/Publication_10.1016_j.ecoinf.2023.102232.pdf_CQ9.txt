Answer:::

The data repository for the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly stated in the provided context to be hosted on a general-purpose data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, it is mentioned that all the scripts and dataset to fully reproduce the results of this work are publicly available at <https://github.com/lucaros1190/LS-MCMC-hybridGenAlgo>. This would suggest that the data repository is hosted on GitHub, which is a web-based platform used for version control and collaboration that allows people to work together on projects from anywhere. This is a common practice in scientific computing to share data and code related to research publications. It is also worth noting that the text mentions the use of a specific HPC scientific computing center, but this does not necessarily imply that the data repository is hosted there.
