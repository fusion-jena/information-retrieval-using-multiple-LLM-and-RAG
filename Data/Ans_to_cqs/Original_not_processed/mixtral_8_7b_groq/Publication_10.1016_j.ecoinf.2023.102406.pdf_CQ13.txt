The provided context does not contain information about the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model. The context focuses on sample thinning, accuracy metrics, variable reduction for correlation, and the methods used for species samples and thinning in random forests.

However, I can provide some general information about hyperparameters commonly used in deep learning models.

In deep learning models, hyperparameters are configuration variables that are set before the learning process begins. These parameters control the training process and can significantly impact the model's performance. Some common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include:

1. Learning rate: This parameter controls the size of the steps taken during gradient descent, which is the optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function. A learning rate that is too high may cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, while a learning rate that is too low may result in slow convergence.
2. Optimizer: This parameter specifies the optimization algorithm used during training. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.
3. Number of layers and neurons: These parameters control the complexity of the model. Increasing the number of layers and neurons can improve the model's ability to learn complex patterns, but may also increase the risk of overfitting.
4. Activation function: This parameter specifies the function used to transform the output of each neuron in the model. Common activation functions include the rectified linear unit (ReLU), sigmoid, and tanh functions.
5. Batch size: This parameter specifies the number of samples used in each iteration of gradient descent. A smaller batch size may result in noisier gradient estimates, while a larger batch size may result in smoother gradient estimates.

It is important to note that the choice of hyperparameters may depend on the specific deep learning model and the dataset being used. Therefore, it is often necessary to perform hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal configuration for a given problem.
