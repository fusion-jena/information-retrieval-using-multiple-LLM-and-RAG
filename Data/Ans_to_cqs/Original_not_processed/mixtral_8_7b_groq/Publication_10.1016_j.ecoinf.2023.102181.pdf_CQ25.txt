Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about a deep learning model being used. However, the context discusses the use of machine learning for predicting soil classes in three semi-arid landscapes and the creation of maps of predicted distributions.

In general, deep learning models can be used for various tasks such as classification, segmentation, and object detection. For the task of predicting soil classes, a deep learning model could be used for classification. In this context, the deep learning model would be trained on input data, such as environmental variables, to predict the corresponding soil class.

However, the context specifically mentions the use of bagging, which is an ensemble learning method that involves creating multiple subsets of the training data and training a model on each subset. The individual models are then combined to make a final prediction. This method can help reduce overfitting and improve the performance of the model.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model, it is possible that a deep learning model could be used for the task of predicting soil classes. However, the specific method being used is bagging, which is a type of ensemble learning method.
