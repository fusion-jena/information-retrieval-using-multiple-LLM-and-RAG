The provided context does not specifically mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of machine learning methods, including deep learning, for estimating above-ground biomass (AGB) in forests.

In the study by Zhang et al. (2019), deep learning-based retrieval of forest AGB is discussed. The study utilized a training-and-test approach with stratification splitting, where tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set was done for each set, followed by model training using an optimal setting of the hyperparameter. However, the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting are not mentioned.

Regularization methods are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent over-reliance on any single neuron. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the weights to the loss function, which encourages smaller weights and helps to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, while the provided context does not specifically mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that regularization techniques such as dropout and L2 regularization were used.
