Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the description of the datasets used in the study, which include annual mean NDVI data, growing season mean NDVI data, spring mean NDVI data, summer mean NDVI data, and winter mean NDVI data. These datasets are obtained from various sources, including MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI, CDR AVHRR NDVI, GIMMS NDVI, SPOT NDVI, and DEM datasets.

The context also discusses the importance of selecting suitable NDVI products based on their strengths and weaknesses. However, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot provide an answer to the query regarding the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
