Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the use of deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNN), for the classification of woody vegetation. It mentions the use of a specific CNN architecture, CNNveg, and the training of a model from scratch using a large dataset and the ADAM optimizer. However, it does not provide a link to the data repository used in this study. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
