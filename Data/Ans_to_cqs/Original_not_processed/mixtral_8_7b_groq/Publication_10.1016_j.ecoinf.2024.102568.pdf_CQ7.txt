Answer:

The context does not provide specific information on how the data is split for training the deep learning models. However, it does mention that the performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Relative Error (MRE) on a test set. It also mentions that the test set is used to determine the number of observations with values outside the range of the training set.

Additionally, the context mentions that the LSTM model is trained using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a loss function and that a dropout layer is added to avoid overfitting. This suggests that the data is likely split into a training set and a validation set, where the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model, such as the dropout rate, and the final performance is evaluated on the test set.

It is also worth noting that the context states that the training set is preprocessed using a MinMaxScaler, which scales the features to a range of [0-1]. This is a common practice in machine learning to ensure that all features are on a similar scale, which can improve the performance of the model.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly state how the data is split for training the deep learning models, it can be inferred that the data is likely split into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters, and the final performance is evaluated on the test set. Additionally, the training set is preprocessed using a MinMaxScaler to scale the features to a range of [0-1].
