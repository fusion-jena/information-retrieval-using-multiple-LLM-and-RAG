Answer:

The context provided does not give specific details about how the raw data was collected in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that multispectral LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data was used in the study. LiDAR is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances and create highly detailed, three-dimensional maps of the Earth's surface. It can be used to collect data on various features such as vegetation, buildings, and terrain.

The term "multispectral" in the context of LiDAR refers to the use of multiple wavelengths of light to collect data. This allows for the measurement of not only the distance to a target but also the reflectance properties of the target at different wavelengths. This can provide additional information about the target's chemical and physical properties.

It is possible that the data used in this study was collected through aerial or terrestrial LiDAR surveys, or it may have been obtained from a public dataset. However, the context does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific details about how the raw data was collected, it can be inferred that multispectral LiDAR data was used in the study. LiDAR is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances and create detailed maps of the Earth's surface. Multispectral LiDAR data provides additional information about the reflectance properties of targets at different wavelengths.
