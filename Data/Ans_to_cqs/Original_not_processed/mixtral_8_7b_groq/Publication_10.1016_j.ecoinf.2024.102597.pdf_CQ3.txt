Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide a general overview of some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning.

In computer vision tasks, data annotation techniques are used to label images or video frames to train deep learning models. Some common data annotation techniques include:

1. Image classification: This is the simplest form of data annotation where an image is labeled with a single class or category. For example, an image of a dog would be labeled as 'dog'.
2. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a bounding box around an object of interest in an image. The bounding box provides the coordinates of the object, allowing the deep learning model to learn the spatial location and size of the object.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with a class or category. This allows the deep learning model to learn the spatial distribution of objects within an image.
4. Instance segmentation: This technique is an extension of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is labeled with a unique identifier. This allows the deep learning model to learn the number and spatial distribution of objects within an image.
5. Landmark annotation: This technique involves identifying and labeling key points or landmarks on an object within an image. For example, in facial recognition, landmarks might include the eyes, nose, and mouth.
6. 3D annotation: This technique involves annotating 3D data, such as point clouds or meshes. This allows deep learning models to learn the 3D shape and structure of objects.

The choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the desired output of the deep learning model. For example, if the goal is to detect and count objects within an image, then instance segmentation might be the most appropriate technique. However, if the goal is to classify images into broad categories, then image classification might be sufficient.

In the provided context, the focus is on quantile sketching algorithms and water quality prediction algorithms, and there is no mention of deep learning or data annotation techniques.
