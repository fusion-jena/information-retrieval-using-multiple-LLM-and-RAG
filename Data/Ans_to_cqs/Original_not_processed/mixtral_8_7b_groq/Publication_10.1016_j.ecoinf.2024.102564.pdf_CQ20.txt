Based on the provided context, the specific type of deep learning model used is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), specifically a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with a hidden layer. However, the context does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training this ANN.

Deep learning models like ANNs can be trained using various hardware resources, including Central Processing Units (CPUs), Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), and Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). CPUs are the primary processors in computers, while GPUs are specialized processors designed to accelerate graphical processing, which can also be used for parallel mathematical computations required in deep learning. TPUs are custom-built application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) developed by Google for machine learning tasks.

The context mainly focuses on the configuration of the ANN, such as the number of neurons in the hidden layer determined by the Fletcher-Gloss method, and the activation functions tested. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the hardware resources used for training the ANN based on the provided information.
