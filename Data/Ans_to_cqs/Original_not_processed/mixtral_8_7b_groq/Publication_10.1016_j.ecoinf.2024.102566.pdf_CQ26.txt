The provided context does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of stratified splitting in the context of ecological informatics. Stratified sampling is a technique used to ensure that the sample is representative of the entire population. In the context of machine learning, this can be used to ensure that the training data is a good representation of the overall data distribution, which can help to reduce bias.

Other techniques that are commonly used to address data bias in deep learning preprocessing include:

1. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of examples from the minority class in the training data. This can help to ensure that the model is trained on a more balanced dataset, which can reduce bias.
2. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of examples from the majority class in the training data. This can also help to ensure that the model is trained on a more balanced dataset, which can reduce bias.
3. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population. This can help to ensure that the model is trained on a diverse set of examples, which can reduce bias.

It's worth noting that the provided context also mentions the importance of incorporating additional factors such as population density, ecological engineering, temperature, and precipitation in constructing a more comprehensive and accurate downscaling model for forest biomass density. This can be seen as a way of increasing the diversity of the data and reducing bias by taking into account a wider range of variables.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of stratified splitting and the importance of incorporating additional factors to increase the diversity of the data. Other techniques that are commonly used to address data bias in deep learning preprocessing include oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
