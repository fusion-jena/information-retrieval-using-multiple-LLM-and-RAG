Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that they used a randomized grid search method to tune the hyperparameters for each machine learning model, including the artificial neural network (a type of deep learning model). This method involves randomly selecting a subset of the parameter grid to explore, which can help reduce the risk of overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

Additionally, the study used three different datasets (CHL-a, SD, and TSS) to evaluate the performance of the models, which could provide some insights into the model's ability to generalize across different tasks. However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether they used other techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or a diverse dataset to further ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.

Therefore, while the study did employ some methods that could indirectly contribute to the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as hyperparameter tuning and evaluating the model on multiple datasets, there is no explicit information provided about the use of other common techniques for improving model generalizability.
