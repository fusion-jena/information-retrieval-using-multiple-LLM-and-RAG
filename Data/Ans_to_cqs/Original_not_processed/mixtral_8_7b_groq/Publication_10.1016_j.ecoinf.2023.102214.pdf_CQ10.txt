Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text describes the research conducted on snow leopard data, the challenges faced in citation studies, and the introduction of a new snow leopard dataset for deep learning research. It also explains the use of Whiskerbook.org, Wild Me software suite, and the combination of PIE and Hotspotter algorithms for image reidentification of snow leopards. However, there is no mention of the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
