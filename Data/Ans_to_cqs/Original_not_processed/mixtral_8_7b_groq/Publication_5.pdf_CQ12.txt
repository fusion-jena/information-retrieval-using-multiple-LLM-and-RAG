Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the deep learning (DL) models were based on the most typical type of neural network, using pixel-wise inputs. This suggests that a feedforward neural network (FNN) or a multilayer perceptron (MLP) might have been used.

Moreover, the context also mentions the use of one-dimensional CNNs and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in the temporal domain as more advanced approaches. This further implies that FNNs or MLPs might have been used in the pipeline, as they can be considered simpler models compared to CNNs and RNNs.

However, it is important to note that the context mainly focuses on the training process, comparison with a random forest (RF) regression model, and potential future improvements, rather than explicitly specifying the deep learning model type. Therefore, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline remains uncertain based on the provided context.
