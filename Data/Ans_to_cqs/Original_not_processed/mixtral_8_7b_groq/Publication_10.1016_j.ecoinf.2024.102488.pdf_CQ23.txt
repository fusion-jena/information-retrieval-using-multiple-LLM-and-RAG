Answer:::

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the use of five base models (TKNN, TRF, TAdaBoost, TXGBoost, TLightGBM) and a meta-model (RF algorithm) for the evaluation of fusion quality. However, I can provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the models used in the process.

To ensure the generalizability of the models, the following measures were taken:

1. Diverse dataset: The feature dataset used in this study consisted of multisource data, including multispectral, hyperspectral, and LiDAR data. This diverse dataset allowed the models to learn from different data sources and improve their ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
2. Cross-validation: The base models' performance was evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. This technique involves dividing the dataset into five subsets, training the model on four of the subsets, and testing it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated five times, with each subset used once as the test set. The average performance across the five runs is then used as the final performance measure. This approach helps to reduce overfitting and provides a more reliable estimate of the model's generalizability.
3. Stratified splitting: Although not explicitly mentioned in the context, the use of stratified splitting could have been employed during the training and validation sample selection. Stratified splitting ensures that each subset has a similar distribution of classes as the original dataset, which can help to maintain the balance between classes and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

In summary, although the context does not mention the use of a deep learning model, it does discuss measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the models used in the study. These measures include using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, and potentially stratified splitting during the training and validation sample selection.
