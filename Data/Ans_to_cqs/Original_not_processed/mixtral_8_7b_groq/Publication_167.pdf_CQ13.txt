Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of a deep learning module to model land use and land cover change (LUCC) and generate probability maps. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.

Based on the general architecture of a deep learning model and the information provided, we can infer some possible hyperparameters that could be used.

One possible hyperparameter is the learning rate, which determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. The learning rate can be set to a fixed value or can be adapted during training using methods such as learning rate decay or adaptive learning rate algorithms.

Another hyperparameter is the choice of optimizer, which determines the algorithm used to update the model's weights based on the gradient of the loss function. Some common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.

The context also mentions the use of a multilayer perceptron (MLP), which is a type of artificial neural network (ANN). The MLP has full connections between the layers, and the output of the hidden layer is calculated as f(W1X + b1), where W1 is the weight, b1 is the bias, and f is the activation function. The activation function can be another hyperparameter to choose from, with common options including the sigmoid function, tanh function, and ReLU function.

In addition, the 10-fold cross-validation method is used to divide the training and validation set into ten parts, which suggests that the model is trained and validated multiple times with different subsets of the data. This process can help to tune the hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

Therefore, while the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not provided in the context, we can infer some possible hyperparameters that could be used based on the general architecture of the model and the information provided. These may include the learning rate, optimizer, activation function, and hyperparameters related to the cross-validation method.
