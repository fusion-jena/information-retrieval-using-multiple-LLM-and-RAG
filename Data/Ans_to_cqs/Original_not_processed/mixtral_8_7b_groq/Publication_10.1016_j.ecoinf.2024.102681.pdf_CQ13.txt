The context provided does not give specific details about the exact hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for drought propagation time and influencing factors. However, it does mention that the model is a hybrid of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), which can give us some insight into possible hyperparameters.

In general, for a CNN model, hyperparameters include the learning rate, the type of optimizer, the number of convolutional layers, the kernel size, the number of filters, and the pooling strategy. For an LSTM model, hyperparameters include the learning rate, the type of optimizer, the number of LSTM cells, the number of hidden layers, the dropout rate, and the learning rate decay.

For the hybrid CNN-LSTM model, the hyperparameters can include a combination of the above, as well as additional hyperparameters specific to the integration of the two models. For example, there may be hyperparameters related to how the CNN and LSTM models are connected, such as the number of units in the dense layer that connects the two models.

The context also mentions that after embedding LSTM into the CNN, the model's prediction accuracy on the testing set has already improved by about 20% compared to the original CNN, even without any adjustments to the hyperparameters. This suggests that the choice of model architecture (i.e., combining CNN and LSTM) may have a larger impact on the model's performance than the specific choice of hyperparameters.

Therefore, while the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for drought propagation time and influencing factors are not provided in the context, we can infer that the model likely includes hyperparameters commonly used in CNN and LSTM models, as well as potentially additional hyperparameters specific to the integration of the two models.
