Answer:::
The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline for evaluating UML algorithms in the context of ecoacoustics is called Darksound and can be found on the open-source repository Zenodo. The dataset is downloadable at this link: <https://zenodo.org/records/10512103>. The data acquisition for building the dataset was made using recordings from the Xeno-Canto database, which were resampled to a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz. The CNN backbones used in the experiment were previously trained on the general ImageNet database, and fine-tuning of the model using a pretrained DenseNet network returned the highest DBCV score in most cases. However, using features extracted from a model trained on spectrograms of bird sounds, such as the BirdNET algorithm, could improve the parameter initialization of UML algorithms of the MEC method.

It is important to note that the results of the experiment showed that using a pretrained DenseNet might fit the Darksound dataset well, but there are no guarantees that it will work on another dataset in the same manner. The results of the experiment are presented in Table 4.1, which includes Density-Based Clustering Validation (DBCV), Adjusted Rand-Index (ARI), and Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) scores, as well as the number of clusters found for the 30 target species.

In summary, the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline is <https://zenodo.org/records/10512103>, and the experiment results suggest that using features extracted from a model trained on spectrograms of bird sounds could improve the parameter initialization of UML algorithms of the MEC method.
