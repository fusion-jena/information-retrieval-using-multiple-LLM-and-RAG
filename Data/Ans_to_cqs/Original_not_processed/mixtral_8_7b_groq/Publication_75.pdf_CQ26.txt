The provided context discusses a deep learning model called SeedNet, which is used for seed image classification and retrieval. However, it does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, deep learning models can be affected by data bias, which occurs when some classes or categories are overrepresented or underrepresented in the training data. This can lead to poor model performance and inaccurate predictions. To address data bias, several preprocessing techniques can be used, such as:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subsets (e.g., training, validation, and testing) while ensuring that each subset has a similar distribution of classes or categories. This helps to ensure that the model is trained and tested on a diverse set of data.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of underrepresented classes or categories in the training data. This can be done by duplicating existing instances or by generating synthetic instances using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of overrepresented classes or categories in the training data. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of instances or by using techniques such as Tomek links.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population or problem being studied. This can help to ensure that the model is trained on a diverse set of data and is not biased towards a particular class or category.

While the provided context does not mention any specific preprocessing techniques used to address data bias, it does mention the imbalance of categories in the datasets as a factor that can influence the classification and retrieval tasks. Therefore, it is possible that some form of preprocessing was used to address data bias, but this is not explicitly stated in the text.
