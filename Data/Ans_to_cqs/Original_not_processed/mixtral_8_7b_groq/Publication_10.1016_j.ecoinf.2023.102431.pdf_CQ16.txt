Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the discriminant model in question. However, it does mention that the model was trained using sample sizes for training, test, and validation groups. 

In general, training of machine learning models, including discriminant analysis, can be considered complete when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly. This is because the goal of training a model is to minimize the difference between the model's predictions and the actual values, which is measured by the loss function. Once the validation loss stops decreasing, it indicates that the model has learned as much as it can from the training data and further training is unlikely to improve its performance.

Additionally, the context mentions that a simple model was developed and compared to a full model, with some slight increase in misclassification for the training and validation sets, but a modest improvement in the test set. This suggests that the training process involved comparing the performance of different models and selecting the one that performed best on the test set.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the discriminant model in question, it is common practice to consider training complete when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly, and to compare the performance of different models to select the best one.
