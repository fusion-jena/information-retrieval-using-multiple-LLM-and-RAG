Answer:::
The deep learning model described in the research article is used for the purpose of object detection in digitized herbarium scans. Specifically, the model is designed to detect and annotate plant organs, such as leaves, stems, and flowers, within the scanned images. This is achieved through the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, which extracts visual features from the image by passing it through a series of convolutional, non-linear, and pooling layers. These layers progressively compute more complex features from the primitive features extracted in the initial layers, such as corners and edges, allowing the model to identify and locate plant organs within the image.

The model was implemented using the Detectron2 library in the PyTorch framework and trained using a Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0025 and momentum of 0.9. The anchor generator in the Region Proposal Network had six anchor scales, each with three aspect ratios, and the thresholds for non-maximum suppression were set to 0.6 for training and 0.25 for testing.

In summary, the deep learning model described in the research article is used for the purpose of object detection, specifically for the detection and annotation of plant organs in digitized herbarium scans. The model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network architecture to extract visual features from the image and progressively compute more complex features, enabling the identification and location of plant organs within the image.
