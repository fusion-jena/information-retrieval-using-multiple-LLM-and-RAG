Answer:

The provided context does not contain information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text focuses on the development of a classification algorithm called FIT (Forensic Information Technology) for discriminating between different animal species and sexes based on their footprints. The training dataset for FIT is built using footprints of known species, sex, or individuals, and a predictor screening analysis is employed to evaluate the contribution of predictors on the response object. However, there is no mention of the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
