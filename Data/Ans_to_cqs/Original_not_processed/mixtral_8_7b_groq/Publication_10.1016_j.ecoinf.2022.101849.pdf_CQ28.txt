Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the formulation of a new computational setting for regression in the context of predictive modeling of global vegetation cover, and the evaluation of a partial-imputation algorithm to reduce noise and improve predictions in the presence of structurally noisy and incomplete target labels. The platforms used for deploying the deep learning model are not mentioned.
