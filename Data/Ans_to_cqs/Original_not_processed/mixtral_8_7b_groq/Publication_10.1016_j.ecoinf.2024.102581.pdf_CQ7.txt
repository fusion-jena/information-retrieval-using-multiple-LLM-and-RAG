Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for training a deep learning model. However, it does mention the terms "training data" and "validation data" in relation to the evaluation of model performance.

In general, when training a deep learning model, the data is typically split into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model.

Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on new, unseen data. To prevent overfitting, a validation set is used during the training process to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance. Hyperparameters, such as the number of convolution layers, filters, and filter size, can be adjusted based on the validation set's performance to improve the model's generalizability.

In the context of the query, the term "validation data" likely refers to the data used to tune the hyperparameters of the deep learning model. However, the specific criteria used to split the data into training, validation, and testing sets is not provided. It is possible that the data was split randomly, or using a specific ratio, such as 70% training, 15% validation, and 15% testing.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific details on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it does mention the use of "training data" and "validation data" in the evaluation of model performance. In general, data is split into training, validation, and testing sets during deep learning model training, with the validation set used to prevent overfitting and tune hyperparameters.
