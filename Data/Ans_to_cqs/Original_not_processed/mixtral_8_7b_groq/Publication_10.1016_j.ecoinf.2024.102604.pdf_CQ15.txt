The provided context does not contain information about the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. The context focuses on sampling bias correction methods in Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and different algorithms used in SDMs, like Generalized Additive Models (GAM), Random Forests (RF), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), and Maximum Entropy (Maxent).

To answer your query, I would like to provide some general information about optimization techniques in deep learning pipelines.

In deep learning, optimization techniques are essential for training models effectively. These techniques help minimize the difference between predicted and actual values by adjusting the model's parameters. Some commonly used optimization techniques include:

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): An optimization algorithm that updates the model's parameters iteratively, using the gradient of the loss function concerning each parameter. SGD is computationally efficient but may converge slowly and get stuck in local minima.

2. Adam: An optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of SGD and other methods, such as Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad) and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp). Adam adapts the learning rate for each parameter, considering both the first and second moments of the gradient. It generally converges faster and more reliably than SGD.

These optimization techniques are widely used in deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. They can be applied to various deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs).

Answer:::
The provided context does not contain information about the optimization techniques applied in deep learning pipelines. However, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam are two commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning. SGD is a simple yet efficient optimization algorithm, while Adam combines the advantages of SGD, AdaGrad, and RMSProp, adapting the learning rate for each parameter.
