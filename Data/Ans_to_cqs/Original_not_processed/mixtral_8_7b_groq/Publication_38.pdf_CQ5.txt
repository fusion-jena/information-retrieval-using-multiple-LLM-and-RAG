Answer:::

The context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for bat acoustic signal detection. However, it mentions the use of iBats Romania and Bulgaria test dataset for testing the performance of different methods. It is possible that the researchers used other datasets for training the deep learning models, but this information is not provided in the context.

The researchers used four methods for bat acoustic signal detection: CNNFULL, CNNFAST, Random Forest, and Segmentation algorithms. CNNFULL and CNNFAST are deep learning methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The context provides details about the architecture of CNNFAST, which consists of two convolution layers, two max pooling layers, and a fully connected layer. The input to the CNNFAST network is a spectrogram, which is generated from the audio signal.

The researchers used the iBats Romania and Bulgaria test dataset to compare the performance and runtime of different methods. The dataset consists of 3.2 minutes of full spectrum audio recordings. The context mentions that close to 50% of the CNN runtime was spent generating the spectrograms for detection, making this the most computationally expensive stage in the pipeline.

The researchers aimed to develop a detection algorithm that would run faster than real time. To increase the speed of the system, they halved the size of the input spectrogram to reduce the input dimensionality to the CNN. The input array to the CNN was of size 130 frequency bins by 20 time steps, corresponding to a fixed length, detection window size of 23ms. The CNN was applied in a sliding window fashion to predict the presence of a search-phase bat call at every instance of time in the spectrogram.

The context also mentions several papers related to deep learning for audio signal processing, including environmental sound classification, large-scale audio classification, and acoustic modeling in speech recognition. These papers may provide insights into the types of datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines for audio signal processing.

In summary, the context does not provide specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for bat acoustic signal detection. However, it mentions the use of the iBats Romania and Bulgaria test dataset for testing the performance of different methods. The deep learning methods used in the pipeline are based on CNNs and take a spectrogram as input. The input size is reduced by halving the size of the spectrogram, and the CNN is applied in a sliding window fashion to predict the presence of a search-phase bat call. The most computationally expensive stage in the pipeline is generating the spectrograms for detection.
