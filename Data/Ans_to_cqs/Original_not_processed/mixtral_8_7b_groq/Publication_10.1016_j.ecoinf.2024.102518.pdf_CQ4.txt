Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the use of different feature classes (L, Q, LQ, LQP) and regularization multipliers in a model, as well as the evaluation of the model's performance using the Akaike minimum information criterion (delta.AICc), Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), and Continuous Boyce Index (CBI). Therefore, I cannot provide information on data augmentation techniques as they are not mentioned in the context.
