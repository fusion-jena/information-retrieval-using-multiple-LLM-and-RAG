Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that high-performance computational hardware, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), are commonly used for training deep learning models, given the complexity of the computations involved in deep noise reduction techniques. These types of hardware are designed to handle the parallel processing required for neural networks, enabling faster training times and more efficient model development. Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention GPUs or TPUs, it is reasonable to assume that they are used in the training process.
