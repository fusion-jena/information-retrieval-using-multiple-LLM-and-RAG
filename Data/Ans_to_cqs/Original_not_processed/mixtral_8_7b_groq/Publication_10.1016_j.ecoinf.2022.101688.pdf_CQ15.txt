Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in the context provided utilizes the Adam optimizer for training the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The Adam optimizer is a type of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm that is commonly used for training deep learning models. It is an extension of the classical SGD algorithm that incorporates adaptive learning rates and momentum terms, allowing for more efficient and effective optimization of model parameters.

In this pipeline, each CNN is trained for 50 epochs using the Adam optimizer with a batch size of 32. The hyperparameters for the optimizer are obtained through a random search, using similar values to those used in a previous study by Dufourq et al. (2021).

The use of the Adam optimizer in this pipeline is motivated by its ability to converge faster and more reliably than other optimization algorithms, such as classical SGD or other adaptive methods like Adagrad or RMSProp. Additionally, the Adam optimizer has been shown to perform well in a variety of deep learning applications, making it a popular choice for training CNNs in particular.

It is worth noting that while the Adam optimizer is used in this pipeline, other optimization techniques may also be applicable depending on the specific problem and dataset at hand. For example, other types of SGD algorithms or regularization techniques like dropout or weight decay may be used to prevent overfitting and improve generalization performance. However, based on the information provided, the Adam optimizer is the primary optimization technique used in this deep learning pipeline.
