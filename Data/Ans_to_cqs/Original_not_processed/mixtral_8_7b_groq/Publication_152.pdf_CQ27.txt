The text provided does not give a detailed explanation of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that data augmentation was used to improve the results of the model. This involved making small changes in brightness and zoom of images collected by a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) at a constant height above ground. The text also mentions that the U-Net model was used to identify Hedychium Coronarium, an invasive vegetation species for the Brazilian natural flora.

Based on common practices in deep learning, it can be inferred that after training the U-Net model, the next step would typically be to serialize the model so that it can be deployed on a platform for real-world use. Model serialization involves saving the model architecture and weights to a file, which can then be loaded and used for making predictions on new data.

The choice of platform for deploying the model would depend on the specific requirements of the application. For example, if the model is to be used for real-time image analysis on a UAV, then a lightweight and efficient platform such as a mobile device or embedded system would be appropriate. On the other hand, if the model is to be used for batch processing of large numbers of images, then a more powerful platform such as a server or cloud-based system would be more suitable.

It is also possible that the authors used techniques such as model compression or quantization to optimize the model for deployment on a specific platform. These techniques involve reducing the size and computational requirements of the model while maintaining acceptable levels of accuracy.

Overall, while the text does not provide a detailed explanation of the deployment process, it can be inferred that common practices such as model serialization and platform selection were likely followed.
