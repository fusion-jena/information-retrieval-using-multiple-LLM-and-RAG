Answer:::

The specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models in the provided context are not explicitly mentioned. However, based on the publication years and the popularity of deep learning frameworks during those times, it is possible to make an educated guess.

In Neves et al. (2020), the authors used a U-net architecture for semantic segmentation of Brazilian savanna vegetation. The original U-net paper by Ronneberger et al. (2015) did not specify a particular framework, but later implementations, such as the one by Kumar (2018), used Keras, a deep learning library that runs on top of TensorFlow. Given the recency of the Neves et al. (2020) paper and the widespread use of TensorFlow, it is reasonable to assume that TensorFlow or Keras was used in this study.

In Torres et al. (2020), the authors used DeepLabv3+ variants for semantic segmentation of endangered tree species in Brazilian savanna. DeepLab is a popular deep learning model for semantic segmentation developed by Google, which is typically implemented using TensorFlow. Thus, it is likely that TensorFlow was used in this study as well.

In Nogueira et al. (2016), the authors used data-driven descriptors for vegetation species discrimination. While they do not mention a specific deep learning framework, they reference the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification by LeCun et al. (1990) and Krizhevsky et al. (2012), which were implemented using early versions of Torch, a deep learning framework that later became PyTorch. Given the age of the Nogueira et al. (2016) paper and the historical use of Torch for CNNs, PyTorch is a possible candidate for the deep learning framework used in this study.

In summary, while the specific deep learning frameworks are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, TensorFlow (or Keras) and PyTorch are the most likely candidates based on the publication years, the deep learning models used, and the historical use of deep learning frameworks during those times.
