Answer:::

The provided context does not contain specific information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline for the detection of artisanal small-scale mining (ASGM). However, it does mention the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for data processing and analysis.

Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform for processing and analyzing large Earth observation datasets (Gorelick et al., 2017). It provides various tools and functions for data preprocessing, such as image correction, normalization, and enhancement. However, it does not explicitly mention techniques for addressing data bias such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

In the context of ASGM detection, the authors of Gallwey et al. (2020) used a Sentinel-2 based multispectral convolutional neural network and a semi-automated reclassification approach for rapid and accurate mining detection. They mentioned that the results demonstrate the potential of this approach that leverages cloud-based machine learning. However, they did not provide details about the preprocessing techniques used to address data bias.

In summary, while the provided context mentions the use of Google Earth Engine for data processing and analysis, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline for ASGM detection. Further research is needed to determine the specific preprocessing techniques used in this context.
