Answer:::
The provided context does not specifically mention the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. The study focuses on the factors that influence the number of views of wild bird videos on YouTube, and it uses a machine learning algorithm, specifically a wrapper feature selection algorithm working with random forest analysis, to select important factors. However, it does not discuss the optimization techniques used in the deep learning process.

The machine learning algorithm used in the study is a type of ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees and combining their outputs. Random forest analysis is a popular and powerful algorithm for classification and regression tasks, and it can handle a large number of features without overfitting. The wrapper feature selection algorithm is used to select the most important features that contribute to the number of views of wild bird videos.

The optimization techniques used in deep learning are crucial for training deep neural networks, which have a large number of parameters. These techniques help to minimize the loss function and find the optimal set of weights and biases. Some of the popular optimization techniques used in deep learning include SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad. These optimization algorithms differ in their ability to handle non-convex optimization problems, their convergence rate, and their memory requirements.

In summary, while the provided context discusses the use of a machine learning algorithm to select important factors that influence the number of views of wild bird videos on YouTube, it does not mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
