Answer:::
The text does not provide specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the training of the Pl@ntNet CNN requires the mobilization of a high-performance computing infrastructure. This suggests that resources such as GPUs or TPUs, which are commonly used for deep learning training due to their ability to perform many calculations simultaneously, were likely used. Additionally, the use of a high-performance computing infrastructure implies that the training process required a significant amount of computational power, which is consistent with the use of specialized hardware. Without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
