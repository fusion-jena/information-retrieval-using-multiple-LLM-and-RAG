Answer:::

The provided context does not specify any particular datasets that were used in a deep learning pipeline. The sources mainly discuss the integration of machine learning and deep learning techniques in the field of animal behavior studies. They mention various methodologies, models, and algorithms such as neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), principal component analysis (PCA), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and deep convolutional networks. However, they do not explicitly mention any of the standard deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

In the context of animal behavior studies, the datasets used would likely involve behavioral data from various animal subjects in controlled experiments, such as the T-maze experiments mentioned in the sources. These datasets might include spatial coordinates, timestamps, and other relevant features that help in predicting and understanding animal behavior patterns.
