Answer:::
I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline's code repository link. The context discusses the differences between deep learning models and XGBoost, including computational requirements, interpretability, and performance on small datasets. It also mentions the use of remote sensing instruments for atmospheric research and hyperspectral indices for assessing vineyard condition. However, there is no mention of a specific deep learning pipeline's code repository.
