Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the models used in the study. However, it is mentioned that the Swin Transformer classifier had the least cost in terms of time, approximately 1.5 hours, while the CoAtNet algorithm required about 5 hours and the proposed 3DUNetGSFormer required around 3.5 hours for their training times. This suggests that the training of these models was likely determined by a pre-specified number of training iterations or epochs, rather than by monitoring the validation loss to determine when training should be stopped. In practice, it is common to use early stopping, which involves specifying a maximum number of epochs and monitoring the validation loss during training. If the validation loss does not improve for a certain number of epochs, training is then stopped to prevent overfitting. Therefore, while the specific criteria used to determine training completion is not provided in the context, it can be inferred that a pre-specified number of training iterations or epochs was used instead of monitoring validation loss.
