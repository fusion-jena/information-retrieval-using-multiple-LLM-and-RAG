The text provided does not give explicit information about the data annotation techniques used for the FishInTurbidWater dataset. However, it can be inferred that a weak labeling method was used for the dataset. Weak labeling is a form of data annotation where information is less specific than in strong or dense labeling methods such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

In weak labeling, data is associated with coarse, inexact, or uncertain labels. For instance, an image can be labeled as 'fish' without specifying the exact location, species, or number of fish instances within the image. This method is less time-consuming and resource-intensive compared to strong labeling techniques, making it suitable for large-scale datasets.

The text states that the FishInTurbidWater dataset was "quickly and weakly labeled" to create the first weakly-supervised fish dataset for turbid waters. This suggests that the annotation process did not involve precise techniques like bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Instead, the data was labeled with weak, general information about the presence of fish in the images.

In summary, the data annotation technique used for the FishInTurbidWater dataset is weak labeling, where images are associated with coarse, inexact labels indicating the presence of fish. The text does not provide information on more specific annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
