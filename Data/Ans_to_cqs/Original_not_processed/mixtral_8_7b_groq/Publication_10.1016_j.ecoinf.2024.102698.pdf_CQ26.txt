Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of synthetic data and various machine learning techniques, but it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some relevant concepts that are often used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique used to ensure that the training, validation, and test sets of a dataset are representative of the overall dataset. This is particularly important when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where one class may be overrepresented compared to others. By stratifying the dataset, we can ensure that each subset contains a similar proportion of samples from each class.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to address class imbalance in a dataset. Oversampling involves creating additional samples from the underrepresented class, while undersampling involves reducing the number of samples from the overrepresented class. These techniques can help to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms by ensuring that they are trained on a more balanced dataset.

Diverse data collection is another technique used to address data bias. By collecting data from a variety of sources, we can ensure that the dataset is representative of the population being studied. This can help to reduce bias and improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques in the context of addressing data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, they are commonly used techniques that can help to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms by reducing bias and improving the representativeness of the dataset.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly answer the query, it does mention some relevant techniques that are often used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. These techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. By using these techniques, we can improve the performance of machine learning algorithms by reducing bias and improving the representativeness of the dataset.
