Based on the provided context, the datasets specifically used in the deep learning pipelines for tasks related to weed species identification and crop/weed recognition are not explicitly mentioned. However, there are several datasets cited in the references that are relevant to the field of agricultural image analysis and deep learning.

One of the datasets is the 'DeepWeeds' dataset, which was introduced in the paper "DeepWeeds: a multiclass weed species image dataset for deep learning" by Olsen et al. (2019). This dataset focuses on the classification of various weed species and contains 8,034 labeled images.

Another dataset is the 'CropAndWeed' dataset, which was mentioned in the context but without a direct reference to a specific paper. This dataset contains 43,814 plant images, but only 8,034 of them are labeled.

The paper by Olaniyi et al. (2023) collected 36,374 RGB images of maize crops and associated weeds. However, only 500 images were annotated with 5,764 bounding box instances.

Moreover, there is a GitHub repository that provides a survey of weed datasets for weed/weed-crop recognition, including URL links to the datasets: <https://github.com/vicdxxx/Weed-Datasets-Survey-2023>.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the datasets used in deep learning pipelines for tasks related to weed species identification and crop/weed recognition, it does provide several relevant datasets that could be used for such tasks. These include the 'DeepWeeds' dataset, the 'CropAndWeed' dataset, and the survey of weed datasets on GitHub.
