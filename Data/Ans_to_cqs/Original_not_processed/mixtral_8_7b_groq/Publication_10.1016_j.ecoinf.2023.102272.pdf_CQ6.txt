The provided context discusses the model selection procedure and the parameters tested for various machine learning models, but it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, data preprocessing is a crucial step in any machine learning project, and it often includes several steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

In the context provided, it is mentioned that the data used for model training and selection were randomly partitioned into four subsets: data for training candidate models (At), data for validating candidate models (Av), data for training the selected candidate model (Bt), and validation data to determine the optimal number of epochs to train the selected candidate model (Bv). It is also mentioned that the data partition was performed in R with package dismo. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data preprocessing steps, if any, were performed using R and the dismo package.

The dismo package provides several functions for data preprocessing, including normalization and scaling. For instance, the `scale` function in R can be used to standardize the variables to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which is a common normalization technique used in machine learning. Similarly, the `rapidNiche` function in the dismo package can be used to transform and scale the variables to a specified range, which is another scaling technique used in machine learning.

Moreover, data cleaning is an essential preprocessing step that is often required before training a machine learning model. Data cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and duplicate data points. The context provided does not mention any specific data cleaning steps that were taken. However, it can be assumed that data cleaning was performed as part of the data preprocessing pipeline.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, it can be inferred that data preprocessing was performed using R and the dismo package. The preprocessing steps likely included normalization, scaling, and data cleaning. However, the specific preprocessing steps are not provided in the context.
