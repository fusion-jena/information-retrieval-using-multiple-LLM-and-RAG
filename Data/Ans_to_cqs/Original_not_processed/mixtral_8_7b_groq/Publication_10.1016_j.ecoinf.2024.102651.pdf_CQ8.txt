Answer:

The provided context does not give information about the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Vision Transformer (ViT), and ResNet in classifying microorganisms and Cervidae. It also mentions the use of RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN, and YOLOv5 in detecting various wildlife. However, it does not mention where the code for these pipelines is available. Therefore, I am unable to provide the location of the code repository.
