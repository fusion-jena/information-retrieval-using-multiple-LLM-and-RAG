Answer:::
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the development and testing of a tree species identification app using Android Studio, TensorFlow Lite, and a CNN-based lightweight model. However, it does not give any information about the code repository, such as whether it is hosted on GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other platform. For more details about the code repository, I would recommend reaching out to the authors or consult the full text of the source if available.
