Answer: The data augmentation techniques applied in the described deep learning pipeline consist of adjusting the contrast and horizontally flipping the images. Specifically, for each "natural" image, four additional images were created: two with increased contrast (120% and 140%) and two with decreased contrast (80% and 60%). Then, all images were horizontally flipped, resulting in a final training dataset (T0) composed of 691,690 images.

It is important to note that the provided context does not mention other common data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, or translation. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot confirm the use of these techniques in the described pipeline.

In summary, the data augmentation techniques applied in this deep learning pipeline include adjusting the contrast and horizontally flipping the images. Other techniques like rotation, scaling, or translation are not mentioned in the provided context.
