Answer:::

Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved, including normalization, scaling, and cleaning. These steps aim to enhance the quality of input data and improve the model's performance.

Normalization is a common preprocessing technique that scales numerical features to a uniform range, often between 0 and 1. This process helps deep learning models converge faster during training and prevents the exploding or vanishing gradient problem. In the context of the given text, normalization might have been applied to the wind speed data before feeding it into the neural network (NN). However, the text does not explicitly mention the use of normalization.

Scaling is another preprocessing technique that adjusts the range of features without altering their distribution. This method is used when features have different units or scales, which could bias the model towards certain features. Similar to normalization, scaling can help deep learning models converge faster and perform better.

Cleaning is an essential preprocessing step that involves handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data. Missing values can be replaced with imputed values, such as the mean, median, or mode of the feature. Outliers can be handled by removing or replacing them with more reasonable values. Noisy data can be smoothed using techniques like moving averages or low-pass filters. While the text does not explicitly mention data cleaning, it does mention the use of random under-sampling (RUS) to address imbalances in the dataset, which is a form of cleaning.

In summary, before training a deep learning model, it is common to perform normalization, scaling, and cleaning of the input data. While the given text does not explicitly mention the use of normalization and scaling, it does mention the use of data cleaning in the form of random under-sampling.
