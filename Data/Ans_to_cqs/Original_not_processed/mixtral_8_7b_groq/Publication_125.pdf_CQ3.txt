The provided context does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that a semantic segmentation was conducted on satellite images to extract four classes (urban, bare soil, vegetation, and road) from the images. In semantic segmentation, each pixel in the image is assigned to a specific class, creating a pixel-wise classification of the entire image. This is different from bounding box annotation, where rectangular boxes are drawn around objects of interest in an image, or instance segmentation, where individual objects are segmented from the image and a mask is created for each object.

The context also mentions that the images were divided into non-overlapping blocks of 256 Ã— 256 pixels and saved into folders with the name of the corresponding class. This could be seen as a form of data preprocessing, but it is not a data annotation technique.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be said that semantic segmentation was used as a data annotation technique, but there is no information about the use of other techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.
