Answer: Based on the information provided, there is no specific strategy mentioned for monitoring model performance during the training process. However, we can infer some practices from the experimental setup and training strategy described.

During the training of each basic model (ResNet-50, ViT-S/16, Volo-d1, and ViP-Small/7), standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, macro-precision, macro-recall, and macro-F1 score were employed to assess the performance of the models. These metrics were calculated on the validation set, which consisted of 7,508 samples. This implies that the model performance was being assessed after each epoch on the validation set, although the text does not explicitly state that this was done to monitor the model performance.

Additionally, the authors used early stopping in their training strategy. They mentioned that the best weights of the ensemble methods were calculated on the validation set. This suggests that they were monitoring the validation loss or validation metrics to decide when to stop the training of the basic models.

It is also important to note that the authors used a Cosine scheduler for learning rate decay. This type of scheduler adjusts the learning rate based on the number of epochs, which can help in stabilizing the training process and improving the final performance of the model.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention a strategy for monitoring model performance during training, it can be inferred that the authors were assessing the model performance after each epoch on the validation set and using early stopping to prevent overfitting. They also used a Cosine scheduler for learning rate decay to help stabilize the training process.
