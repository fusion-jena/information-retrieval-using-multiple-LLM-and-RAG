Based on the provided context, there are no specific details about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, the context does provide information about the accuracy evaluation metrics used to assess and compare the predicted and actual images. These metrics include the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and error relative global accuracy (ERGAS).

The coefficient of determination (R2) reflects the goodness-of-fit of the predicted images to the reference images, with values ranging from negative infinity to 1. An R2 value of 1 indicates perfect alignment between the predicted and true values, while R2 = 0 indicates that all of the predicted values are equal to the mean of the true values. Values below zero indicate no correlation.

The root mean squared error (RMSE) measures the differences between the predicted and actual values, with a lower value indicating better performance. The mean absolute error (MAE) is another metric that measures the differences between the predicted and actual values, but it uses the absolute value of the differences.

The error relative global accuracy (ERGAS) is a metric that measures the spatial distortion between the predicted and actual images. It takes into account the spatial distribution of the errors and is useful for evaluating the performance of image fusion methods.

While these metrics are used to evaluate the accuracy of the predicted images, they are not used to determine when training is complete. To determine when training is complete, one common approach is to monitor the validation loss and stop training when it plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model is no longer improving. Other approaches include using early stopping techniques or setting a maximum number of training epochs.

Therefore, while the context provides information about the accuracy evaluation metrics used in the study, it does not provide information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete.
