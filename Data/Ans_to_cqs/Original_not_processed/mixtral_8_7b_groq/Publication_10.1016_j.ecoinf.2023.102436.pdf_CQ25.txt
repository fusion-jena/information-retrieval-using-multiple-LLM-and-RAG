The provided context does not directly mention the specific purpose of a deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the automatic recognition of woody regrowth vegetation in repeat landscape photographs.

In the context of image processing and computer vision, a convolutional neural network is typically used for image classification, object detection, or semantic segmentation tasks. Based on the given information, it can be inferred that the CNN in this case is used for object detection or semantic segmentation.

Object detection involves identifying and locating objects within an image, often by drawing bounding boxes around them. In the context of landscape photographs, the CNN could be detecting instances of woody regrowth vegetation.

Semantic segmentation, on the other hand, involves classifying each pixel in an image into a specific category. In this case, the CNN could be segmenting the image into areas of woody regrowth vegetation and other classes (e.g., background, other vegetation types).

The purpose of using a CNN for this task is likely to automate and improve the accuracy of the analysis of landscape photographs. By automatically recognizing and locating instances of woody regrowth vegetation, planners and designers can more easily track changes in the landscape over time. Additionally, the use of a CNN can potentially increase the speed and efficiency of this analysis compared to manual methods.

However, it's important to note that the provided context does not explicitly state the purpose of the CNN. Therefore, this answer is based on inference from the given information.
