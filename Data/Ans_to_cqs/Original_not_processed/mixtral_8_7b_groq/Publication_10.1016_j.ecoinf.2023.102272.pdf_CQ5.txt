Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. The context focuses on the parameters tested and values for each classical machine learning model and deep learning model used for testing each year.

However, it can be inferred that the datasets used in the study are related to classical machine learning and deep learning models for predicting disease vector abundance. The deep learning models used are not specified but are referred to as deep-ANN architecture types.

In the provided context, there are references to other studies that use specific datasets for deep learning. For example, the MNIST dataset is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems (Lecun et al., 1998). The CIFAR dataset is a collection of labeled images used for object recognition research (Krizhevsky et al., 2009). ImageNet is a large-scale hierarchical image database designed for visual object recognition research (Deng et al., 2009).

Therefore, while the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline in the provided context are not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that they are related to predicting disease vector abundance, and the deep learning models used are deep-ANN architecture types. Additionally, other studies have used datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet for deep learning.
