Answer:::

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include horizontal flipping, grayscale conversion, blurring, and adding noise. These techniques were used to extend the amount of information and prevent overfitting during the training of a model for object detection.

In the study, each image was randomly sampled to undergo one of the following data augmentation options: the entire original image, horizontal flip, grayscale, blur, noise, or cropping. Specifically, 25% of the images had grayscale applied, blur was up to 10px, noise was up to 10% of pixels, and a patch with the same size as the original image was randomly cropped for the cropping operation. Examples of these data augmentation techniques are illustrated in Figure 3.

However, the context does not mention rotation or scaling as data augmentation techniques used in this study. Therefore, it can be concluded that these techniques were not applied in this particular deep learning pipeline.

In addition, the study used the YOLO model, which is a popular object detection algorithm. The model was trained and validated using hyper-parameters such as 4000 iterations, 200 epochs, a learning rate of 0.001, batch size of 16, and subdivisions of 64.

Overall, the data augmentation techniques of horizontal flipping, grayscale conversion, blurring, and adding noise were used in this deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting and extend the amount of information during the training of a model for object detection.
