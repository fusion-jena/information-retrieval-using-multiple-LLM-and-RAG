Based on the provided context, it is not possible to explicitly outline the process that was followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, there are some indications of the possible steps that might have been taken.

Firstly, the context mentions the use of IEEE Xplore, which is a digital library providing access to scientific and technical content in various formats, including papers, articles, and conference proceedings. It is likely that the researchers consulted resources from this platform to gather information on deep learning model deployment.

Answer:::
The deep learning model deployment process might have involved model serialization, which is the process of saving the model's architecture, weights, and other relevant information into a file. This file can then be used to recreate the model at a later time, facilitating the sharing and reuse of models. The context does not explicitly mention any specific serialization libraries or formats, but Python libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn provide built-in support for model serialization.

Answer:::
Another step in the process could be platform selection. The context does not provide information on the specific platform used for deployment. However, popular deep learning model deployment platforms include cloud services like Google Cloud, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft Azure, as well as on-premises solutions like Kubernetes and Docker.

Answer:::
The context also mentions the use of various tools and libraries related to deep learning and machine learning, such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and OpenCV. These tools might have been used during the model training phase, and some of them, like TensorFlow Serving and TorchServe, can also be used for model deployment.

Answer:::
Lastly, the context mentions the use of Thüringer Universitäts, which could be a reference to the University of Jena in Thuringia, Germany. This suggests that the deep learning model deployment process might have been carried out in an academic or research setting, possibly following best practices and guidelines established by the institution or the research community.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not offer a comprehensive overview of the deep learning model deployment process, it suggests that the researchers might have followed standard practices, including model serialization and platform selection, using popular deep learning libraries and tools.
