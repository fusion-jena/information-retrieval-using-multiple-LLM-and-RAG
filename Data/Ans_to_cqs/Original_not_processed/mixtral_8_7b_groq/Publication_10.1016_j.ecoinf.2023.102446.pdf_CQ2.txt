The provided context does not give specific information about the deep learning pipeline or the data formats used in it. However, it does mention that the study involves data collection and processing related to carbon sources and sinks in the Himalayas. The data used in this study includes half-hour temporal resolution flux tower data, which is likely stored in a structured format such as CSV or a scientific data format like NetCDF.

The CRediT authorship contribution statement mentions contributions related to data curation, suggesting that the data was processed and prepared for use in the study. Still, there is no explicit information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the provided context does not give enough information to determine the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.
