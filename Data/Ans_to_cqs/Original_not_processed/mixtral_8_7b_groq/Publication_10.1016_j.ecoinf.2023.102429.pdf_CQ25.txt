Based on the provided context, the specific deep learning model used is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the model is used for regression purposes. This is evident in the description of the Support Vector Machine for Regression (SVMR) model, which is a kernel-based machine learning algorithm used for regression and classification tasks. The SVMR model is used to construct the calibration model for predicting soil nutrient concentrations.

The deep learning model is trained using the libsvm package in MATLAB, and the training model is established using data from the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) that has undergone continuum removal (CR) and sensitive bands filtered by the CARS algorithm. The model uses an epsilon-insensitive loss function, which ignores errors within a certain epsilon range and penalizes errors larger than the epsilon. The epsilon-SVR model and Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) are used to determine the optimal parameters for the model, which help avoid overfitting.

The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSEcv) values. The optimal parameter values for the model are selected based on these RMSEcv values. Other evaluation metrics used for the model include the coefficient of determination (R2), the ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ), and the ratio of performance to the standard deviation of the measured values (RPD).

Therefore, based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is to predict soil nutrient concentrations using SVMR regression.
