Based on the provided context, the specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model are not mentioned. The text focuses more on the modifications and optimizations of the cellular automaton model, which is a type of classification model based on the Monte Carlo method.

However, it is generally common practice to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which significantly speeds up the computations required for training these models. Training deep learning models can be computationally intensive, and GPUs are specifically designed to handle such tasks efficiently.

Moreover, there are other hardware accelerators available, such as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which are custom-built by Google for machine learning tasks. TPUs are designed to accelerate the tensor operations that are fundamental to deep learning models.

Given the computational demands of training deep learning models, it is reasonable to assume that some form of hardware acceleration, such as GPUs or TPUs, is used. However, the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model in this context are not provided.
