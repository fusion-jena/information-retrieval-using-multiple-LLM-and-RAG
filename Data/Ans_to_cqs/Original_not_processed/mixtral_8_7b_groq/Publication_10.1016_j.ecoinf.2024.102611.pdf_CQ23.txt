Based on the provided context, the following measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, although it does not specifically mention the use of a deep learning model:

1. Diverse dataset: The data suggests that different samples are present across groups to establish the reliability and generalizability of the model. This implies that the dataset is diverse, as it contains various samples from different groups.

2. Consistent ratios: To avoid any potential bias during classification, consistent ratios across groups are maintained in the sampling process. This ensures that the model is exposed to a balanced representation of each group, enhancing its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

3. Separate evaluation: For evaluation, both validation and test sets are considered separately to fine-tune the modelâ€™s hyperparameters. This two-step evaluation process helps in generalizability and scalability towards unseen datasets.

4. Hierarchical classification: The Random Forest (RF) classifier is used in both levels of the hierarchical classification model for performing group and plant-level predictions. This hierarchical approach allows the model to learn more complex relationships between the groups and plants, potentially improving its ability to generalize.

5. Convolution features: The performance of the baseline hierarchical classification model is compared with and without convolution features. The fusion of convolution features seems to improve the model's performance, suggesting that these features contribute to the model's generalizability.

While the text does not explicitly mention cross-validation or stratified splitting, the other measures listed above still provide a solid foundation for ensuring the generalizability of a deep learning model. However, if the model were to be a deep learning model, incorporating cross-validation and stratified splitting would further enhance the model's ability to generalize.
