Answer:::
The text provided does not give information about general datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention a specific dataset used in a deep learning pipeline for bird sound classification. The dataset is called CLO-43DS, which is used for classifying 43 bird species. This dataset is composed of audio recordings obtained using both directional and omnidirectional microphones, with varying signal-to-noise ratios. The recordings are then processed to extract time-frequency representations (TFRs) of the bird sounds. Three types of TFRs are mentioned: Mel-spectrogram, harmonic-component based spectrogram, and percussive-component based spectrogram. A different deep learning architecture, SubSpectralNet, is employed for classifying bird sounds using Mel-spectrogram as input. The experimental results show that fusing selected deep learning models can effectively increase the classification performance.
