Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are no specific datasets mentioned that were used in a deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, there are several research papers and sources mentioned that may contain information about the datasets used in their respective studies.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) website mentioned in the context could potentially provide access to geographical and topographical datasets that could be used in a deep learning pipeline. The USGS EROS Archive provides access to digital elevation data, including data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) that could be used for image analysis and processing.

The research papers by Vergara-torres et al., (2010), Pant (2013), Vollering and Raes (2016), and Pearson et al., (2004) may contain information about the datasets used in their respective studies. These papers focus on topics such as host preference and limitation of vascular epiphytes, medicinal orchids and their uses, phytogeography of New Guinean Orchids, and modelling species distributions in Britain. These studies may have used various datasets related to plant species, geographical locations, and environmental factors.

It is important to note that the context provided does not explicitly mention the use of any deep learning pipeline or specific datasets. Therefore, further investigation would be required to determine the specific datasets used in a deep learning pipeline related to the mentioned research papers or sources.
