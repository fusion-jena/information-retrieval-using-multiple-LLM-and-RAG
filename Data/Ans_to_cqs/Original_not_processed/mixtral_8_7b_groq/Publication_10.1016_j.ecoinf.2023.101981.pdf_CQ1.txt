Answer:

In the context provided, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through the deployment of acoustic recorders, specifically the Song Meter SM2 recorder by Wildlife Acoustics. These recorders were deployed at four different sites and programmed to record the first 15 minutes of each hour from June 8, 2015, to May 31, 2016. The recordings were stored in .wav format with a sampling rate of 48 kHz and 16 bits per sample resolution. The devices were checked weekly to download data and change batteries, resulting in a total of 32,023 15-min recordings, which equates to 8006 hours of recording.

Although the text does not explicitly mention the term "deep learning," it does suggest the potential use of advanced recognizers and supervised machine learning algorithms for automated cattle detection. These methods typically require manually labeled events for training, which implies the use of surveys or manual labeling of the collected acoustic data.

However, the text does not discuss other possible sources of raw data, such as public datasets. Therefore, based on the provided context, acoustic recorders are the primary method for collecting raw data, with potential additional data collection through surveys or manual labeling for advanced recognizer development.
