Answer:::

The specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models in the given context are not mentioned. However, based on the models that were used, we can make some educated guesses.

The models used include MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, GoogleNet, DenseNet201, InceptionV3, ResNet18, InceptionResNetV2, and NASNetMobile. These models are commonly implemented in popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

For instance, MobileNetV2 and EfficientNetB0 are part of TensorFlow's official model library, while GoogleNet and InceptionV3 are available in both TensorFlow and PyTorch. DenseNet201, ResNet18, and NASNetMobile are also available in both frameworks.

Therefore, while the specific framework is not mentioned, it is highly likely that one of these two popular deep learning frameworks, TensorFlow or PyTorch, was used to build the models.
