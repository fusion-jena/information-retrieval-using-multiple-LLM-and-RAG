Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of confusion matrices and the assessment of accuracy metrics.

In the context given, confusion matrices are calculated for different combinations of imagery sources and classification algorithms. These matrices are used to evaluate the performance of the models by comparing the predicted classes with the actual classes. Specifically, four values are reported in each confusion matrix: true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN). TP represents the number of pixels that are correctly classified as having the Brazilian peppertree present, while FP is the number of pixels that are incorrectly classified as having the Brazilian peppertree present. TN represents the number of pixels that are correctly classified as not having the Brazilian peppertree present, while FN is the number of pixels that are incorrectly classified as not having the Brazilian peppertree present.

Additionally, three accuracy metrics are reported based on the confusion matrices: overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, and user's accuracy. Overall accuracy is the percentage of pixels that are correctly classified out of the total number of pixels. Producer's accuracy is the percentage of pixels that are correctly classified as having the Brazilian peppertree present out of the total number of pixels that actually have the Brazilian peppertree present. User's accuracy is the percentage of pixels that are correctly classified as not having the Brazilian peppertree present out of the total number of pixels that are actually free of the Brazilian peppertree.

It is important to note that the confusion matrices and accuracy metrics are calculated on the 20% of the data not used for training the algorithms, which is approximately 720 pixels with 50 having the Brazilian peppertree present. This approach ensures that the evaluation of the models is unbiased and independent of the training process.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of confusion matrices and the assessment of accuracy metrics such as overall accuracy, producer's accuracy, and user's accuracy. These steps are essential to evaluate the performance of the models and ensure that they are accurately classifying the presence or absence of the Brazilian peppertree.
