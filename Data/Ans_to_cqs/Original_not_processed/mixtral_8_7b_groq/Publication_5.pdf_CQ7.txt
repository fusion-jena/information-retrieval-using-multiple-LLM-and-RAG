Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to split the data into these three sets to evaluate the performance of the model and to ensure that it can generalize well to unseen data.

Typically, the data is split into a training set, which is used to train the model, a test set, which is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data, and a validation set, which is used during the training process to tune the hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

The exact criteria used to split the data can vary depending on the specific application and the amount of available data. In some cases, the data may be split randomly into train, test, and validation sets. In other cases, the data may be split based on certain characteristics, such as time or location.

In the context provided, it is mentioned that the deep learning model was trained on data from Korea for model training and testing. However, it is not clear whether the data was split into train, test, and validation sets, or how this was done.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it is likely that standard practices for data splitting were followed.
