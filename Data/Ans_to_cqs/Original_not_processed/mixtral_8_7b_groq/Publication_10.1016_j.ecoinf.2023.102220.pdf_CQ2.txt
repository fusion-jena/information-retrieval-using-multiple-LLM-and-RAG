Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the implementation of the classification methods was carried out in Python using the libraries TensorFlow and Scikit-learn.

TensorFlow is a popular open-source library for machine learning and deep learning, and it supports a variety of data formats, including CSV, images, audio, and video. Scikit-learn, on the other hand, is a library for machine learning in Python that is built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, and it supports various data formats such as CSV, arrays, and matrices.

Therefore, based on the libraries used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that the data formats used could be CSV, images, audio, or video. However, the specific data format used in the study described in the context is not provided.

Another study that used machine learning for forecasting the 2017-2018 Yemen cholera outbreak used LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) method by adding a long short term memory block on the DNNâ€™s (Deep Neural Networks) architecture. The implementation of the classification methods was carried out in Python using the libraries TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. In this study, the data format used is time series data.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning pipeline can support various data formats, including CSV, images, audio, video, and time series data, depending on the specific problem and the data available.
