Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no specific mention of data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for wildfire detection. However, the context does mention a paper by Sousa et al., 2020 that proposed a transfer learning approach with data augmentation techniques for wildfire detection.

Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning to increase the amount of training data, improve model performance, and prevent overfitting. Some common data augmentation techniques include:

1. Flipping: This involves flipping the image horizontally or vertically. Horizontal flipping is a popular technique used in image classification tasks.
2. Rotation: This involves rotating the image by a certain degree. Rotation can help the model learn to recognize objects in different orientations.
3. Scaling: This involves changing the size of the image. Scaling can help the model learn to recognize objects at different scales.
4. Translation: This involves shifting the image horizontally or vertically. Translation can help the model learn to recognize objects in different positions.
5. Color jittering: This involves changing the brightness, contrast, and saturation of the image. Color jittering can help the model learn to recognize objects in different lighting conditions.
6. Random erasing: This involves randomly erasing a portion of the image. Random erasing can help the model learn to recognize objects in the presence of occlusions.

The context mentions that Sousa et al., 2020 proposed a transfer learning approach with data augmentation techniques for wildfire detection. However, the specific data augmentation techniques used in their approach are not provided. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
