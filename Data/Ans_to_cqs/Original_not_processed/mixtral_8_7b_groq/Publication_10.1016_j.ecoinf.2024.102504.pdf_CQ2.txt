Answer:::

The provided pieces of context do not give a detailed description of the data formats used in the deep learning pipelines. However, they do mention the use of specific datasets in air quality and pollution studies, which can give us an idea of the possible data formats.

In the study by Navares and Aznarte (2020), they used deep learning Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for air quality prediction. The data format they used is not explicitly mentioned, but they utilized historical air quality data for training their models. It can be inferred that they used a time-series data format, likely in the form of a CSV file, containing features like pollutant concentrations, meteorological variables, and temporal information.

Neckel et al. (2023) used Sentinel-3B SYN satellite images and self-made passive samplers for air pollution analysis in Budapest. In this case, the data format would be raster images for the satellite data and potentially CSV files for the passive sampler data.

Ogen (2020) assessed nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels as a contributing factor to coronavirus (COVID-19) fatality. The study likely used gridded or raster data formats for NO2 concentrations, which could have been obtained from satellite sensors or ground-based monitoring stations.

Chianese et al. (2019) used a multi-layer perceptron for spatio-temporal learning in predicting ambient particulate matter concentration. They utilized air quality monitoring stations' historical data, which suggests a CSV or similar tabular data format.

In summary, the data formats used in deep learning pipelines for air quality and pollution studies can include time-series data (CSV), raster images (satellite data), and tabular data from air quality monitoring stations. However, the exact data formats are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
