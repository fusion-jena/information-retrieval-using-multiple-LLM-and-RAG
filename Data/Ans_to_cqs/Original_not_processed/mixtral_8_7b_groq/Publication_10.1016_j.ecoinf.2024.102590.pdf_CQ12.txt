Answer:::
The provided context does not specify the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions the potential use of deep learning methods for future land use and land cover analysis. Therefore, I cannot provide the specific type of deep learning model (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) used in the pipeline based on the given information.
