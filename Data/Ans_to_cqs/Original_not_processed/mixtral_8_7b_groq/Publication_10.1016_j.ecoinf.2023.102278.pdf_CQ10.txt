Answer:::

I regret to inform you that there is no direct link to a code repository provided in the context. The text focuses on discussing the use of deep learning for classifying living organisms, specifically insects, and comparing the performance of different optimization algorithms and architectures. However, it does not give any information about the code repository used for the discussed deep learning pipeline.
