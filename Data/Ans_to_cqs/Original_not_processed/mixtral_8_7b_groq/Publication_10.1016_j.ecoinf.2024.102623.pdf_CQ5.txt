Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that a new loss function for Species Distribution Models (SDMs) is introduced and a multi-species neural network model is employed in the experiments. However, it does not specify the names of the datasets used. Therefore, I cannot provide the names of the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline in this case.
