Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, we can infer some possible preprocessing steps from general practices in deep learning image classification tasks.

First, in the "D. Model Training" section, it is mentioned that the dataset was divided into a training set and a test set in a 75:25 ratio. This step of splitting the data into separate sets for training and testing is a common preprocessing step in machine learning tasks.

Next, in the "A. Transfer Learning from Pre-trained Models" section, it is mentioned that the bottleneck features are used for feature extraction. This implies that some form of preprocessing might have been applied to extract these bottleneck features. In image classification tasks, bottleneck features often refer to the output of a pre-trained model's last convolutional layer before the fully connected layers. This output is typically a high-dimensional feature vector that captures the spatial information of the input image. To extract these features, the input images would have been preprocessed to match the input requirements of the pre-trained model, such as resizing and normalization.

Resizing the input images is a common preprocessing step in deep learning image classification tasks. This ensures that all input images have the same dimensions, allowing for efficient batch processing during training. Normalization is another common preprocessing step that involves scaling the pixel values of the input images to a specific range, often between 0 and 1. Normalization helps the model converge faster during training and improves the overall performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken, it is likely that the dataset was split into training and testing sets, and the input images underwent preprocessing steps such as resizing and normalization before being used for feature extraction.
