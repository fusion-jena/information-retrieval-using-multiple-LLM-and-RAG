Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, the context does mention that a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used as a deep learning model for remote sensing applications.

In general, for deep learning models, data splitting criteria involve dividing the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

For remote sensing applications, a common practice is to use 70% of the data for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. However, the exact criteria can vary depending on the specific application, dataset size, and other factors.

In the context of the provided table comparing the training time, prediction time, optimization time, and hardware for CNN and XGBo beta models, it is not clear if these times include the validation process or not. It is possible that the training time for the CNN model includes both the training and validation times, but this is only an assumption.

Therefore, while there is no specific information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in the provided context, it is common practice in deep learning applications to use a training, validation, and testing split. The exact criteria can vary depending on the specific application and dataset.
