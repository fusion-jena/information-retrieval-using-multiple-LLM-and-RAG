Answer:

The context provided does not give information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The sources cited in the text, such as Hollmann et al. (2022), Aze-dou et al. (2023), Saha et al. (2022), Rahman et al. (2023), and the AutoGluon library, do not mention or provide a link to the data repository used in the study. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
