Answer: The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context is ImageNet. The pre-trained ResNet-50 model used as the foundation for the CNN was trained on over 1 million images from ImageNet, which contains 1000 categories of common objects, including numerous animals. The high computational complexity of the deep learning process and the limited GPU memory (8 GB) restricted the mini-batch size to 64 images. The training image set used in this study was significantly imbalanced, requiring both a large variety of background images and a certain minimum number of polar bear images in each mini-batch. The precise numbers of training images of various sorts were calibrated to ensure that the total number of training images was divisible by 64, so that no images were excluded from each training epoch.
