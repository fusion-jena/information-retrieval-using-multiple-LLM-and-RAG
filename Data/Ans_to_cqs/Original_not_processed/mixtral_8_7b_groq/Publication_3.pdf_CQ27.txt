The text provided does not give a detailed explanation of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that they used TensorFlow, a popular machine learning framework, to train their convolutional neural network (CNN) model for species identification. TensorFlow provides various options for model serialization and deployment, such as saving the model as a Protobuf file, converting it to a frozen graph, or even deploying it directly to various platforms like TensorFlow.js for web-based applications or TensorFlow Lite for mobile and edge devices.

Additionally, the researchers mentioned generating new spectrograms for 41 species, including 21 new, undescribed species, and testing the performance of their CNN model on this expanded dataset. This step indicates that they likely used model serialization to export the trained model and then used it to make predictions on the new dataset.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly describe the process used for deploying the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that they likely used TensorFlow's model serialization capabilities to save the trained model and then utilized it to predict the new dataset. The specifics of the platform selection or deployment process are not mentioned in the text.
