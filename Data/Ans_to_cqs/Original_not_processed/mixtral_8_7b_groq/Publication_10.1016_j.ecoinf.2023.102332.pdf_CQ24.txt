The provided context does not contain information specific to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a pre-trained word2vec model, which is a type of deep learning model. In the context of word2vec and other deep learning models, strategies to handle randomness can include setting a fixed random seed value. This ensures that the random initialization of weights and other parameters is reproducible, allowing for consistent model training and results. Additionally, techniques such as dropout and batch normalization can help reduce the impact of randomness and variability in model performance. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero during training, preventing overfitting and promoting robustness. Batch normalization normalizes the inputs of each batch, reducing internal covariate shift and making the network more stable during training. While not explicitly mentioned in the context, these strategies are commonly employed in deep learning pipelines to handle randomness and improve model performance.
