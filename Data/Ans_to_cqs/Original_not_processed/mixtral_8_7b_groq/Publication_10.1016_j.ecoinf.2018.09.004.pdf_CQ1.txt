Answer:::

The paper "Seagrass detection in the Mediterranean: A supervised learning approach" by Dimitrios Effrosynidis et al. does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in their deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide information about the types of data and databases they used in their study.

The authors combined data from various databases such as EMODnet, UNEP, and CMEMS to determine the most appropriate variables affecting the distribution of seagrasses in the Mediterranean Sea. These databases likely contain data collected through various methods such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets.

The variables used in the study include bathymetry, temperature, salinity, chlorophyll-Î±, nitrate, phosphate, Secchi Disk Depth, wave height, distance from the nearest city, distance from the nearest river mouth, distance from the nearest port, distance to coast, and substrate. These variables suggest that the data used in the study were collected using methods such as in-situ measurements using sensors, remote sensing using satellites, and public databases containing information about the geographical and environmental characteristics of the Mediterranean Sea.

The substrate variable, for example, has categories such as coarse and mixed sediment, coarse sediment, fine mud, mixed sediment, mud to muddy sand, muddy sand, rock or other hard substrate, sand, sandy mud, sandy mud to muddy sand, and seabed. These categories suggest that the data for this variable were collected using in-situ measurements, possibly through methods such as sediment sampling and analysis.

Therefore, while the paper does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data, it can be inferred that the data were collected using various methods such as in-situ measurements, remote sensing, and public databases.
