Based on the provided context, there is no specific information given about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models considered for water quality parameter (WQP) estimation. The text mainly focuses on comparing the performance of various ensemble learning models such as Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost for estimating Chla concentrations and turbidity in Nansi Lake.

However, it is mentioned that deep learning algorithms were also considered, but the limited number of samples was not conducive to deep learning. This suggests that deep learning models might have been taken into account, but the context does not provide details about the specific deep learning models or their hyperparameters.

In general, hyperparameters for deep learning models like learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, and activation functions can significantly impact model performance. The choice of these hyperparameters depends on the specific deep learning model and the dataset being used.

Answer:::
Regretfully, the provided context does not include specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models considered for water quality parameter estimation.
