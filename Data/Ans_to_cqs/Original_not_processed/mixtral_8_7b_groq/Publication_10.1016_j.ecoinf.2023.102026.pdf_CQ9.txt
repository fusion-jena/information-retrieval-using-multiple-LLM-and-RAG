Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository for it. The context refers to two studies published in the journal Ecological Informatics, both of which compare the performance of Generalised Linear Models (GLMs) and Random Forests in species distribution modeling for Southeast Asian felids. The studies use elevation data with six different scales, ranging from 1000 m to 10,000 m.

The first study, "Not seeing the forest for the trees: Generalised linear model out-performs random forest in species distribution modelling for Southeast Asian felids," is authored by Zaneta Kaszta, Eric Ash, and L. Chiaverini. The second study, "Multi-scale species distribution modelling: a comparison of random forest and generalised linear models," is also authored by L. Chiaverini and other researchers.

However, neither of the studies mentions the use of deep learning or provides information about a data repository for a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
