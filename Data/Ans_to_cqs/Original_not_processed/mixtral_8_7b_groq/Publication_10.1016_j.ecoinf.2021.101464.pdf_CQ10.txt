Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context mainly discusses the results of an ecological informatics study that used a random forest model for data analysis. Specifically, it mentions that the model was applied using R statistical software, but it does not provide a link to the code repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested information.
