Answer:

The deep learning pipeline used in the study referred to in the context employs two main datasets for extracting embeddings from female gibbon calls. The first dataset is used in conjunction with the VGGish model, a CNN based on the VGG image classification model with 11 weight layers. This model was trained by Google for general-purpose audio classification using a preliminary version of the YouTube-8M dataset. The second dataset is utilized with the BirdNET model, an architecture specifically trained for bird vocalization recognition.

The YouTube-8M dataset is a large-scale video dataset, consisting of over 6 million YouTube video IDs, with a total of 300 million video segments and 500 hours of video. The dataset is labeled with 3,862 categories, and it is used to train and evaluate video analysis models. In this study, a preliminary version of the dataset was used to train the VGGish model for audio classification tasks.

The BirdNET model, on the other hand, was originally trained using a large dataset of bird vocalizations. Although the specifics of this dataset are not provided in the context, it is mentioned that BirdNET outperformed other models like VGGish and Wav2Vec 2.0 in classifying gibbon vocalizations.

In addition to these two datasets, the study also highlights the potential of using a dataset of gibbon vocalizations to train a deep learning model specifically for gibbon discrimination. However, the authors decided against this approach due to the large data requirements and high computational cost.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in this study uses the YouTube-8M dataset for training the VGGish model and an unspecified bird vocalization dataset for training the BirdNET model. The context also suggests the potential of using a gibbon vocalization dataset for training a model tailored for gibbon discrimination.
