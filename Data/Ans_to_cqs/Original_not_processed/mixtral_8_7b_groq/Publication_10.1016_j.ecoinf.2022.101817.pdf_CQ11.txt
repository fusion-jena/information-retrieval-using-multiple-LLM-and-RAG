Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the methods and results of the study, which involve using a deep learning model called VGG16 to classify underwater images based on various conditions. However, there is no mention of where the data and code for this pipeline are stored or shared. It is possible that the data and code are not publicly available, or that they are hosted on a platform that is not mentioned in the text. If you are interested in accessing this information, I would recommend contacting the authors of the study directly.
