The provided pieces of context do not specifically mention the data formats used in deep learning pipelines for forest fire susceptibility. However, they do discuss the use of machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Boosted Regression Trees (BRT), and Classification and Regression Trees (CART), for predicting and mapping forest fire susceptibility.

In general, deep learning models can handle various data formats, such as images, audio, video, and CSV files, depending on the specific problem and application. For forest fire susceptibility, the data formats typically include raster-format remote sensing images (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel, MODIS) and tabular data (e.g., CSV) containing geographic and environmental variables.

For instance, the study by Saha et al. (2023) used remote sensing data, including Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) images, and geographic information system (GIS) layers, such as digital elevation models (DEMs) and land cover maps, to predict forest fire susceptibility. These data formats were likely preprocessed and converted into suitable formats for the machine learning algorithms used in the study.

Moreover, the study by Shahfahad et al. (2022) integrated remote sensing and machine learning algorithms for forest fire susceptibility mapping. They used Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS images, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM, and other GIS layers as input data. These data formats were preprocessed and transformed into suitable formats for the machine learning models.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in deep learning pipelines for forest fire susceptibility, it can be inferred that raster-format remote sensing images and tabular data (e.g., CSV) containing geographic and environmental variables are commonly used data formats in this context. Deep learning models can handle various data formats, depending on the specific problem and application.
