The provided context discusses a study related to ecological informatics, including methods, results, and discussion. However, it does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps involved after the model training such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

The methods section describes the study area, data collection, and model training process. The results section presents the performance measures of the model using different detection thresholds. The discussion section interprets the results and compares them with previous studies. However, none of these sections mention any postprocessing steps.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query. It is possible that the study did not involve any postprocessing steps mentioned in the query or they were not included in the paper.
