Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the training process involves the use of powerful computational tools, such as a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) or a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), due to the complexity of the model and the computations involved.

The context discusses a deep learning model that employs a neural network and a backpropagation algorithm for learning neighborhood relationships in a system. The model aims to improve the results of the system by understanding the interaction between different elements. This implies that the training process requires a significant amount of computational power to handle large datasets, complex computations, and the optimization of neural network weights.

Moreover, the reference to a survey on missing data in machine learning published in 2021 suggests that the research and development of the deep learning model are recent, and it is likely that the authors used up-to-date computational resources for training their model. Given that GPUs and TPUs are the most common hardware resources used for deep learning tasks nowadays, it is reasonable to assume that the authors utilized one or both of these tools for training their model.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, it can be inferred that the authors used powerful computational tools, such as GPUs or TPUs, due to the complexity of the model and the computations involved.
