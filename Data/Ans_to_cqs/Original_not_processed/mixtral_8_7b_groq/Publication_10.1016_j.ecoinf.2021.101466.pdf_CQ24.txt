Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of a specific strategy to introduce randomness during the training of a deep learning model, which is random erasing. However, it does not directly mention the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Random erasing is a data augmentation technique used to improve the robustness and performance of deep learning models by randomly erasing some regions of the input images (Hu et al., 2017). In the context, random erasing is applied to the training dataset of the EfficientNet model, which leads to a moderate improvement in performance (Table 6).

On the other hand, a random seed value is used to control the randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the initialization of weights in the neural network, the order of data samples, and the splitting of datasets (LeCun et al., 2015). However, the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value.

In summary, the provided context discusses the use of random erasing as a strategy to handle randomness during the training of a deep learning model. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
