Answer:::

The pieces of context provided do not specifically mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the parameters of a deep learning model are adjusted following an optimization process during the training phase.

Some of the popular optimization techniques used in deep learning are Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple optimization algorithm used in deep learning. It updates the parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters. SGD uses a single example at a time to calculate the gradient, making it computationally efficient.

Adam is an optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of two other optimization algorithms, AdaGrad and RMSprop. Adam adjusts the learning rate based on the first and second moments of the gradient. It has been found to perform well in practice and is widely used in deep learning.

RMSprop is an optimization algorithm that adjusts the learning rate based on the root mean square of the gradient. It is similar to Adagrad but has a moving average of the squared gradient.

Adagrad is an optimization algorithm that adjusts the learning rate based on the historical gradient. It is particularly useful for sparse data because it adapts the learning rate for each parameter.

In summary, while the pieces of context provided do not specifically mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, popular optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad.
