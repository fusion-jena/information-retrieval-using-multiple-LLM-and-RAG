Answer:::
The deep learning model used in this study for Waveman, a system designed for identifying bat species from their acoustic calls, is trained using a Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), specifically an Nvidia 1080ti. This is mentioned in the context when describing the training process of the model. It's stated that a model was trained using the training dataset (which includes 111,244 images) for 50-60 times using the GPU for two hours and 10 minutes. Therefore, the hardware resource used for training the deep learning model in this study is a GPU, specifically an Nvidia 1080ti.
