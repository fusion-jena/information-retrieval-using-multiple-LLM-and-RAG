Based on the given context, there is no specific information about the deep learning model, its architecture, or the hyperparameters used in the model. The context mainly discusses various applications of machine learning and remote sensing in different studies, including Scikit-learn, Google Earth Engine Python API, and hyperspectral remote sensing.

However, when working with deep learning models for land use and land cover classification, common hyperparameters include:

1. Learning rate: The step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function.
2. Optimizer: An algorithm used to update the weights and biases in the network based on the gradient of the loss function. Examples include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.
3. Batch size: The number of samples processed before the model's weights are updated.
4. Number of layers and units per layer: The architecture of the neural network, including the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each layer.
5. Activation functions: Functions applied to the output of each neuron, such as ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh.
6. Regularization techniques and strengths: Methods to prevent overfitting, such as L1, L2, or dropout regularization.
7. Loss function: The function measuring the difference between the predicted and actual values.

These hyperparameters can significantly impact the performance of deep learning models. Typically, hyperparameters are tuned using techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to find the best set of hyperparameters for a given problem.

Answer:::
 Although the provided context does not contain specific information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, common hyperparameters include learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of layers and units, activation functions, regularization techniques, and loss function. These hyperparameters are often tuned to optimize the model's performance for a given problem.
