Answer:::

 Based on the information provided, there is no mention of a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. The abstract mentions the use of drone imagery, deep learning, and convolutional neural networks for mapping the density of Pacific oysters, but it does not provide a link to the code repository.

 The CRediT authorship contribution statement lists the authors' contributions, such as formal analysis, software, and writing, but it does not specify where the code can be found. Similarly, the acknowledgements mention the creation of a dataset, but they do not provide a link to the code repository.

 Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. If the authors have made the code publicly available, they may have provided a link in the full article or on their personal or institutional websites. However, based on the provided context, there is no link available.
