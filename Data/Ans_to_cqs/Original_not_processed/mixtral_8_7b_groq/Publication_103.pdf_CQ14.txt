The context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other method for hyperparameter tuning.

However, the context does mention that different models were trained and tested using various datasets and pre-training strategies. For example, the models H255.CR.CR and H255I.CR.CR were pre-trained on the Herbarium255 dataset and then fine-tuned on the Costa-Rica leaf scans training set. The model H1K.PC.PC was pre-trained on the Herbarium1K dataset and then fine-tuned on the PlantCLEF training set. These experiments suggest that some hyperparameter tuning was done to determine the number of epochs for pre-training and fine-tuning, as well as the learning rate and other parameters.

Additionally, the context mentions that a model whose hyperparameters, architecture, and data augmentation are thought for herbarium in particular, to maximize accuracy for a system dedicated to herbarium in mind, is recommended. This suggests that the hyperparameters of the model were optimized with the specific goal of improving accuracy on herbarium data.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific details on the methods used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model, it is clear that some hyperparameter tuning was done to improve the performance of the models on the various datasets used in the experiments.
