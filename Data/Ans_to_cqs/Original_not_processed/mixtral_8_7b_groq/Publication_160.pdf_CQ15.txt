Answer:::

In the deep learning pipeline, various optimization techniques are employed to effectively train the neural networks. The studies mentioned in the context use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and other optimization methods.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is used to train the top layer of a ResNet152 baseline model. In this case, SGD is employed with a learning rate of 10−3 and a weight decay rate set to 5 × 10−4. SGD is a popular optimization technique for training neural networks, as it updates the model parameters using the gradient of the loss function concerning a single training example or a small batch of examples.

Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is another optimization technique used in the context. Specifically, it is utilized to train various ResNet architectures, such as ResNet18, ResNet50, and ResNet152, with different patch sizes and batch sizes. The learning rate for Adam is set to 10−3, while other parameters are kept at their defaults, following the original study. Adam is an extension of SGD that adaptively adjusts the learning rate for each parameter, making it suitable for large-scale problems and non-stationary objectives.

The context does not explicitly mention other optimization techniques. However, it does mention the use of the Adam optimizer with different learning rates and the training of a ResNet152 baseline model using SGD. These two optimization techniques, SGD and Adam, are widely used in deep learning pipelines for training neural networks.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in the provided context utilizes Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam as optimization techniques. SGD is used to train the top layer of a ResNet152 baseline model, while Adam is employed to train various ResNet architectures with different configurations.
