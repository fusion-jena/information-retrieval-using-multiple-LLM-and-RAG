While the provided context does not directly discuss data bias mitigation techniques in the deep learning pipeline, it does offer some insights into the general preprocessing methods used in machine learning. It is essential to address data bias during preprocessing to ensure the model's performance and fairness. Some common techniques used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a sampling technique that ensures each subset (e.g., training, validation, or testing) has approximately the same percentage of samples for each class as the original dataset. This method helps maintain the class distribution and reduces bias in the dataset.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance the class distribution in an imbalanced dataset. Oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class, while undersampling reduces the number of samples from the majority class. Both methods help improve the model's performance by reducing bias towards the majority class.

Diverse data collection is another approach to reducing data bias. Collecting data from various sources, locations, and conditions ensures that the dataset represents the real-world distribution of the target variable. This method helps the model generalize better and reduces the risk of overfitting to specific patterns in the data.

In the context of the provided sources, the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm was used for Fv/Fm parameter estimation. XGBoost is a decision-tree-based ensemble machine learning algorithm introduced by Chen and Guestrin (2016). The authors applied XGBoost to a small dataset with structured data (Fv/Fm and vegetation indices) and used feature importance scores for interpretability. Although not explicitly mentioned, the authors might have used stratified splitting or other bias mitigation techniques during preprocessing to ensure the model's performance and fairness.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss data bias mitigation techniques in the deep learning pipeline, it highlights the importance of preprocessing methods such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These techniques help reduce data bias and improve the model's performance and fairness.
