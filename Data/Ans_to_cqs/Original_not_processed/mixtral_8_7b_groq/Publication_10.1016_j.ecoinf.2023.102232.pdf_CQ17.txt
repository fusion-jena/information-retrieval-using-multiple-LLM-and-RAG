Based on the provided context, the text does not discuss any regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The text focuses on a specific methodology that combines the Least Squares (LS) algorithm with a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Metropolis-Hastings-like macro step for estimating the parameters of a system.

The LS algorithm is used to estimate the parameters by minimizing the sum of the residuals. The GA is then applied to optimize the results of the estimation and explore the space of the parameters. The Genetic Algorithm generates random combinations of initial values based on the best-fit values stored in a database, and the Metropolis-Hastings-like macro step aims to improve the estimation of the parameters' distribution.

Therefore, based on the given context, the text does not provide information on regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines.
