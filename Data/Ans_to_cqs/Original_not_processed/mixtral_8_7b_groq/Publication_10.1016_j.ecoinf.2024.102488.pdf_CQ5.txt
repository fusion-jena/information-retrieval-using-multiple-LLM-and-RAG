Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in this particular study does not involve any of the commonly used datasets in machine learning literature, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, this study utilizes a combination of multi-source remote sensing data, including:

1. GF-1 optical imagery: These are multispectral images captured with a wide-format WFV camera, having four bands of blue, green, red, and near-infrared with a spatial resolution of 16 m. A total of 21 GF-1 multispectral images of the study area in 2020 were retrieved from the China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application. However, due to dense cloud cover, there was no applicable imagery for the months of June, July, or August. All GF-1 multispectral images were radiometrically calibrated, corrected for the atmosphere, and registered.

2. GF-3 SAR imagery: Although the context does not provide specific details about the GF-3 SAR imagery, it can be inferred that this data source is also part of the remote sensing data utilized in the study.

3. MODIS NDVI imagery: These images were derived from the MOD09Q1 dataset with a resolution of 250 m and an interval of 8 days. A total of thirteen MOD09Q1 images in 2020 were obtained from the Earthdata database and then projected into the GF-1 image and resampled to 16 m resolutions using the nearest neighbor resampling method.

The study focuses on processing and analyzing these remote sensing datasets rather than using standard machine learning datasets. Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in this context is specifically tailored for processing and analyzing multi-source remote sensing data.
