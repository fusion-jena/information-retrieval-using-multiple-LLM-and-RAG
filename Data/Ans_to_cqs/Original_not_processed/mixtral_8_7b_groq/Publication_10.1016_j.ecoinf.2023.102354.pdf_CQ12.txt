Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It is mentioned that the study lies in exploring the potential of deep learning and machine learning algorithms for enhancing groundwater-climate interactions understanding. However, the particular deep learning model, such as CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), or Transformer, is not specified.

The study seems to focus on analyzing and identifying potential hotspots of groundwater-climate interaction in the Great Artesian Basin, Australia, using various datasets, including terrestrial water storage, soil moisture storage, groundwater storage, and standard precipitation evapotranspiration index, among others. However, the deep learning model used in the analysis is not mentioned in the provided context.
