The provided context does not directly discuss the deep learning pipeline or strategies for handling randomness such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does describe the PLUS model, which is a land use change simulation model that uses the random forest algorithm, a type of machine learning algorithm, but not deep learning.

In the PLUS model, randomness is employed in the land expansion analysis strategy (LEAS) module in the form of the random forest algorithm, which is a type of ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions. The random forest algorithm introduces randomness by selecting a random subset of the features at each node for splitting, which helps to reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of the model.

Additionally, the PLUS model uses a multi-type random patch seed mechanism in the cellular automata (CA) module. This mechanism introduces randomness by selecting cells with a higher total probability to change preferentially, following a decreasing threshold rule for generating patch seeds. This gradual constraint on patch growth of various land use types is achieved through an iterative process.

However, the context does not mention any specific strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
