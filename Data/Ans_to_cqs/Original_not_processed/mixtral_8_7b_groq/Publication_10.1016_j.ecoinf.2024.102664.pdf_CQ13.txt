Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of different deep learning models for training a network and their performance in predicting certain time series data. The deep learning models mentioned include Adam, SGDM, RMSProp, CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM. Among these, the CNN-LSTM model is subjected to sensitivity experiments to investigate the impact of different parameters on its forecasting performance.

However, the context does not explicitly provide information on the learning rate or other specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models. Hyperparameters are crucial components of machine learning models, and they can significantly affect the model's performance. Commonly used hyperparameters include learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and choice of optimizer.

In this case, the optimizer is mentioned as one of the deep learning models (e.g., Adam, SGDM, RMSProp). Still, the specific learning rate or other hyperparameters are not specified. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to accurately answer the query regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models.

In summary, the context provides valuable information about the performance of various deep learning models in predicting time series data. However, it does not offer explicit details about the learning rate or other hyperparameters used in these models. As a result, a definitive answer to the query cannot be provided based on the given context.
