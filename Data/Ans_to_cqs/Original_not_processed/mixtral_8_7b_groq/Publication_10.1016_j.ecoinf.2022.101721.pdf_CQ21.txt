Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about specific postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix that are involved after the model training. However, it is mentioned that the outcome of the model is presented in a figure and stored as a .csv file, which suggests that some form of metrics calculation and data visualization are being used.

In the context, the focus is on using Bayesian statistics and incorporating additional information about bats found outside the realm of ultrasound data to improve the accuracy of bat identification. The authors use R-code to implement the Bayesian algorithms and to generate a full sample of 10,000 observations using both uninformative and informative priors.

The authors also mention the importance of including all observations in statistical modeling, rather than excluding them, to improve the reliability of studies. This suggests that some form of error analysis or confusion matrix may be used to evaluate the performance of the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix, it does suggest that some form of data visualization and error analysis are being used to evaluate the performance of the model.
