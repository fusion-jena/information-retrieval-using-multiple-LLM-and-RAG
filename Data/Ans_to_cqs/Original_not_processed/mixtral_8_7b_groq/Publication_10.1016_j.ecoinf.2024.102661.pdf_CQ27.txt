The text provided does not give explicit details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model undergoes a training process comprising 10,000 iterations, during which it logs the chosen hyperparameter combinations, associated training times, and loss values. This systematic recording aims to pinpoint the hyper-parameter sets that deliver optimal performance upon completion of the calculations.

Based on common practices in deep learning model deployment, we can infer that the model serialization process likely occurred after the training phase. Model serialization involves saving the model's architecture, weights, and biases to a file, allowing it to be loaded and used for making predictions on new data. This is a standard practice for deploying deep learning models, as it enables the use of the model in various platforms and environments.

As for the platform selection, the text does not provide information on where or how the model was deployed. It could have been deployed on a local machine, a server, or a cloud platform, depending on the specific requirements and resources available.

In summary, while the text does not provide explicit details about the deployment process, it is reasonable to infer that the model underwent serialization after training, and was then deployed on a platform suitable for the specific application.
