Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, we can infer some possible approaches based on the context.

The data provided appears to be raster format, where each pixel has a value representing the type of land cover or vegetation. The first step in preparing this data for deep learning would be to split it into training, testing, and validation sets.

One possible approach could be to split the data based on geographical location. For example, we could divide the data into different regions or countries and use one region for training, another for testing, and a third for validation. This approach would ensure that the model is not overfitting to a specific location and can generalize well to other areas.

Another approach could be to split the data based on the type of land cover or vegetation. For example, we could use pixels with a specific land cover type (e.g., cropland, grassland, or water bodies) for training, and pixels with different land cover types for testing and validation. This approach would ensure that the model is learning to recognize different types of land cover and can generalize well to new types.

A third approach could be to split the data based on the mean scores per climate pixel. As mentioned in the context, the mean scores were determined by converting the values into raster format. We could use pixels with high mean scores for training, and pixels with low mean scores for testing and validation. This approach would ensure that the model is learning to recognize areas with high and low vegetation density and can generalize well to new areas with different vegetation densities.

In addition to these approaches, it is important to ensure that the training, testing, and validation sets are representative of the overall data. This means that the sets should have a similar distribution of land cover types, vegetation densities, and geographical locations.

Overall, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training would depend on the specific research question and the characteristics of the data. A combination of the approaches mentioned above could be used to ensure that the model is learning effectively and can generalize well to new data.
