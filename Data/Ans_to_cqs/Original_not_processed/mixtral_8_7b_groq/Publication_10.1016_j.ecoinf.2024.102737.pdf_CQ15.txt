Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. However, it does mention that the Siamese networks in the pipeline use Contrastive Loss (CoL) as a loss function. The context also discusses the use of Siamese architectures with either 2 or 4 convolution layers and Relu activations, but it does not specify the optimization techniques used during training.

In general, deep learning models can be optimized using various techniques such as SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and others. The choice of optimization algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the model and the dataset. For instance, SGD with momentum or the Adam optimizer are commonly used for training deep neural networks.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that standard optimization algorithms like SGD or Adam were employed during training.
