Based on the provided context, there is no information about the data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context focuses on spectral analysis and pre-processing techniques for estimating total nitrogen (TN) using partial least-squares regression (PLSR) and other machine learning algorithms.

However, data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, which can help improve model performance and prevent overfitting. Some popular data augmentation techniques for image data include:

* Flipping: Horizontal or vertical flipping of the image.
* Rotation: Rotating the image by a certain angle.
* Scaling: Changing the size of the image by scaling it up or down.
* Translation: Shifting the image horizontally or vertically.
* Cropping: Randomly cropping a portion of the image.
* Color jittering: Changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue of the image.
* Gaussian noise: Adding Gaussian noise to the image.

These techniques can be applied on-the-fly during training, allowing the model to learn invariances and robustness to these transformations. However, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
