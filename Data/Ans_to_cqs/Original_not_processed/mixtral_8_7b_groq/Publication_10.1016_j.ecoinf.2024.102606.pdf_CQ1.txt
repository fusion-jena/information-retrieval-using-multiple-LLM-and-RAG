Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for Collembola identification. However, it does mention that the study uses a new manually annotated dataset, which implies that manual data collection or annotation was involved.

In general, deep learning pipelines for ecological data can use various methods for raw data collection. These methods can include surveys, where experts manually collect data through observation and recording. Sensors, such as cameras or other monitoring devices, can also be used to automatically collect large amounts of data. Public datasets, which are often made available by research institutions or government organizations, can provide another source of raw data for deep learning models.

For example, in the context provided, the PlantCLEF challenges offer a large and complex image dataset for state-of-the-art machine learning models to uncover and evaluate. This dataset is likely collected through a combination of manual surveys and automated sensors.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for raw data collection in the deep learning pipeline for Collembola identification, it is mentioned that a new manually annotated dataset was used. In general, deep learning pipelines for ecological data can use various methods for raw data collection, including surveys, sensors, and public datasets.
