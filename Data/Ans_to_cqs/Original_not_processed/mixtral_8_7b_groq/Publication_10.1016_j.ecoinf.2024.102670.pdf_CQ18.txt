The provided context discusses two papers, one from 2023 (Gillette et al.) and another from 2004 (Martin et al.), as well as a brief mention of a method by Sharma et al. from 2017. However, none of these papers directly address the query about monitoring model performance during training.

In general, there are several strategies that can be used to monitor model performance during training, including:

1. **Validation set evaluation**: This involves setting aside a portion of the training data as a validation set, which is used to evaluate the model's performance at various stages of training. This can help identify if the model is overfitting or underfitting the data.

2. **Learning curves**: Plotting the model's performance on the training and validation sets at different stages of training can help visualize whether the model is improving or if it has reached a plateau.

3. **Early stopping**: This is a regularization technique where training is halted as soon as the model's performance on the validation set stops improving or starts degrading, preventing overfitting.

4. **Regularization techniques**: Techniques like L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and batch normalization can help prevent overfitting and improve model generalization, which can be monitored during training.

5. **Model diagnostics**: Techniques like gradient checking, activation visualization, and saliency maps can provide insights into the model's behavior and help identify issues.

Without more specific information from the papers or the context, it's not possible to provide a more precise answer. However, these are some general strategies for monitoring model performance during training.
