Answer:::

Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are involved, including normalization, scaling, and cleaning. However, the specific context of the given text does not mention these steps explicitly in the process of training a deep learning model. Instead, it focuses on the proposed framework for coral bleaching detection, which includes the following preprocessing steps:

1. Initially, an image is taken with the help of an underwater drone.
2. The image is segmentized and divided into small patches.

After these preprocessing steps, feature extraction is performed using handcrafted descriptors and D-CNNs (Deep Convolutional Neural Networks), such as AlexNet, ResNet-50, VGG-19, GoogleNet, and Inceptionv3. These features are then used to create a visual vocabulary (VV), which is essentially a set of features extracted from the original features. The visual vocabulary is then passed to a classifier, such as SVM, kNN, or decision tree, to classify whether the VV-features are of bleached coral or healthy coral.

Therefore, based on the given context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include image segmentization and patch extraction, followed by feature extraction using handcrafted descriptors and D-CNNs. The text does not mention any explicit steps for normalization, scaling, or cleaning; however, these steps are generally recommended as best practices in deep learning model training. Normalization typically involves scaling the input data to a range of [0,1] or a standard deviation of 1, while scaling can refer to adjusting the range of the data. Cleaning, on the other hand, involves removing any noise, outliers, or irrelevant information from the data.
