Answer:::
The specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not provided in the given context. However, it does mention that the transfer learning and fine-tuning technique was applied using the ResNet50 model, which was pre-trained on ImageNet data. The ResNet50 model includes feature extraction layers, and the top network was reconfigured with two fully connected layers to learn new features. To reduce overfitting, a dropout technique was used.

In general, hyperparameters in deep learning models can include the learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, and the number of epochs. The learning rate determines the size of the steps that the model takes during training, while the optimizer determines the strategy used to update the model's weights. The number of layers and neurons determines the complexity of the model, while the batch size and number of epochs determine the number of training examples used in each update and the total number of updates, respectively.

In the context of bird species identification using sound spectrograms, other studies have used hyperparameters such as a learning rate of 0.001, an Adam optimizer, a batch size of 32, and a number of epochs ranging from 50 to 100. These studies have also used data augmentation techniques such as time stretching and pitch shifting to increase the size of the training data and reduce overfitting.

Therefore, while the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not provided in the given context, it is common to use a learning rate of 0.001, an Adam optimizer, a batch size of 32, and a number of epochs ranging from 50 to 100 in bird species identification using sound spectrograms. Additionally, data augmentation techniques such as time stretching and pitch shifting can be used to increase the size of the training data and reduce overfitting.
