Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning model in the context provided is denoising, specifically for bioacoustic applications. Deep noise reduction methods, as established by Xie et al., 2021, typically use a U-net architecture, which includes an encoder and decoder section. The encoder compresses the input data into a latent space representation, while the decoder uses this latent space to reconstruct the denoised waveform.

In recent years, transformer attention mechanisms have been successfully applied to deep noise reduction techniques, as demonstrated by Cao et al., 2022; Luo and Mesgarani, 2019, 2023; Zhang et al., 2022; and Zhao et al., 2022. These models have been optimized for bandwidths ranging from 16 to 22 kHz, which are common in natural language processing (NLP) applications such as human speech enhancement. However, bioacoustic applications often exceed this bandwidth, and the sparsity of vocalisations makes the development of large-scale datasets infeasible.

Deep learning-based denoising methods have been predominantly used in NLP, but recent SOTA deep learning methods have successfully used raw waveform data for wider applications such as source separation and classification (Wang et al., 2021; Luo and Mesgarani, 2019, 2023). This approach eliminates errors introduced during the conversion of time-domain signals to the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and reduces reconstruction errors due to the loss of phase information.

When training deep noise reduction techniques, collecting clean recordings is often infeasible or requires the recording of captive animals, which may not be representative of the wider population. Adjacent fields can generate human speech or music as required, but this is not an option for many bioacoustics applications. Therefore, generating training data for fine-tuning presents challenges, and generally, clean data is collected, and noise profiles are superimposed to provide both the input data and a "denoised" ground truth.

In summary, the purpose of the deep learning model in the provided context is denoising, particularly for bioacoustic applications that require models to handle bandwidths exceeding 22 kHz and address the challenges associated with generating training data for fine-tuning.
