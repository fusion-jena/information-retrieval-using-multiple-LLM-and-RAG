The text provided does not directly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. However, it does specify the metrics used to evaluate the performance of models for a specific task, which are the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and the true skill statistics (TSS).

The AUC of the ROC is a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes. A value of 1 indicates perfect discrimination, while a value of 0.5 indicates no discrimination ability.

The TSS, also known as the Hanssen and Kuipers discriminant, is a measure of the model's overall performance. It is defined as the sum of sensitivity and specificity, minus one. A value of 1 indicates perfect performance, while a value of -1 indicates the worst possible performance.

It is not specified if the deep learning model is one of the models used in the study, but if it is, these two metrics (AUC of the ROC and TSS) could be used to evaluate its performance.

It's worth noting that, deep learning models are often evaluated using a variety of metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc. These metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance on different aspects, such as its ability to correctly classify positive and negative examples, or its ability to correctly identify true positive examples.

In summary, while the text does not specifically mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, it does specify the metrics used to evaluate the performance of models for a specific task, which are the AUC of the ROC and the TSS. These metrics could also be used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model if it is one of the models used in the study.
