The provided context does not contain information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The text discusses the application of machine learning, specifically the Random Forest method, to predict reproductive conditions in fish. However, it does not mention the use of deep learning or the hardware resources employed in the training process.

Machine learning and deep learning are related but distinct techniques. Machine learning is a broader category that includes methods like Random Forest, which was used in the study. Deep learning, on the other hand, is a subset of machine learning that involves neural networks with many layers.

The text does mention that machine learning algorithms, in general, use computational methods to learn directly from data. This implies the use of computer hardware, but it does not specify the type of hardware, such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) or TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), which are often used in deep learning for their ability to perform many calculations simultaneously.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to accurately answer the query about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.
