Based on the provided context, there is no specific type of deep learning model mentioned as being used in the pipeline. Do and Tran (2023) discuss combining a deep learning model with an optimization algorithm, but they do not specify the type of deep learning model used. It is possible that they used a model such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer, but this information is not provided in the context. Therefore, I cannot give a specific answer to this query.
