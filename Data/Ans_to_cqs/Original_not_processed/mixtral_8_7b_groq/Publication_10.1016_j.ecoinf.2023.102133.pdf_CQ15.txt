Answer:::

The optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular optimization method used in training neural networks. It is an iterative algorithm that updates the parameters of the model in the opposite direction of the gradient of the loss function. In SGD, the gradient is calculated for each training example, rather than for the entire training set, which makes it computationally efficient. However, SGD can sometimes converge slowly or get stuck in local minima.

Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is a more recent optimization method that has been shown to perform well in deep learning applications. Adam is an adaptive learning rate method that combines the ideas of SGD and Momentum. It calculates the exponentially decaying averages of the gradient and the squared gradient, which are then used to update the parameters of the model. Adam has been found to converge faster and more reliably than SGD, especially in high-dimensional problems.

In the context provided, the Adam optimization method was used to train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model for estimating site-specific crop evapotranspiration with low-cost sensors. The MLP model consisted of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer, with each neuron connected to the next layer through a weight and a bias. The weighted sum of the input variables was transformed into an output value through a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function. The training of the network was done using a backpropagation algorithm, which consisted of two phases: a forwarding phase where the activation of the input layer neurons was pushed through the network, and a backwarding phase where the error value was propagated backward and the weights of each link were modified using the Adam optimization method.

In summary, both SGD and Adam are optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines. While SGD calculates the gradient for each training example, Adam calculates the exponentially decaying averages of the gradient and the squared gradient, which are then used to update the parameters of the model. The choice of optimization method depends on the specific problem and the requirements of the application. In the context provided, the Adam optimization method was used to train an MLP model for estimating site-specific crop evapotranspiration with low-cost sensors.
