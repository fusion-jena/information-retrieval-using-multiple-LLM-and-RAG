Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mainly focuses on the configuration and training process of the model, including the use of the Adam solver, number of neurons in the hidden layers, learning rate, and activation function. It also mentions the use of a feedforward ANN called Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and the training of the network using a backpropagation algorithm. However, it does not specify whether GPUs, TPUs, or any other specific hardware resources were used for training the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
