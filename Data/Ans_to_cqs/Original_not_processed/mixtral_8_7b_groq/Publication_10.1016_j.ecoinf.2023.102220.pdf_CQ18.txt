Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the Prediction Breakdown Procedure (PBP) method was evaluated using accuracy, false positive rate, and true positive rate metrics. 

The PBP method was applied to different training data obtained from percentages of the initial observations of the time series of aphids. The accuracy values were higher than 70% regardless of the percentage of training using the original aphid time series. The negative binomial (Ï• = 1.2) model produced the highest average accuracy of 84.6% with a standard deviation of 20.5%. The Gaussian model followed with an accuracy of 75.2% and a standard deviation of 18.0%. 

Additionally, the PBP method was compared with other machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machines, Deep Neural Networks, Long Short Term Memory, and Random Forests. The PBP method yielded a competitive performance associated with higher true-positive rates in most comparisons while providing interpretability. 

The context also mentions that the implemented PBP method in Python through the pypbp package was provided, which suggests that the model performance could be monitored during training by using this package. However, the specific strategy for monitoring the model performance during training is not provided.
