Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The CRediT authorship contribution statement mentions the contributions of the authors but does not mention any code repository. The data availability section only provides a link to the data used in the study, and the acknowledgements do not mention any code repository.

The closest related information is the mention of software contribution by Alexander N. Gavrilov in the CRediT statement. However, it does not specify where the software or code is available.

Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline.
