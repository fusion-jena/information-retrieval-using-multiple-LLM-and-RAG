Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation. However, it is mentioned that a study used deep learning-based retrieval of forest AGB (Zhang et al., 2019), but the annotation techniques are not specified.

In the context, various studies have used LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) and Landsat 8 data for AGB estimation. LiDAR data is often used in the form of point clouds, which can be processed to extract features like tree height, canopy cover, and stem volume (Anderson & Bolstad, 2013; Bouvier et al., 2015; Blackburn et al., 2021). Landsat 8 data, on the other hand, are multispectral satellite images that can provide information about vegetation health and cover.

For machine learning and deep learning models, the studies mentioned in the context have used various techniques for training and validation. These techniques include:

1. Training-and-test approach with stratification splitting (Xue, 2015; Section 2.6)
2. Hyperparameter tuning on the training set (Xue, 2015; Section 2.6)
3. Model training using an optimal setting of the hyperparameter (Xue, 2015; Section 2.6)

As for the regression models used, four methods were mentioned in Xue (2015; Section 2.7): AdaBoost, random decision forest (RF), multilayer neural network (NET), and Bayesian ridge regression (Bayes). These models typically require labeled data for training, but the context does not provide information on how the data was annotated.

In summary, while the context provides information on data sources, data processing, and machine learning techniques for forest AGB estimation, it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Common annotation techniques for LiDAR point clouds include point-wise annotation, bounding box annotation, and instance segmentation, but the context does not specify which of these was used.
