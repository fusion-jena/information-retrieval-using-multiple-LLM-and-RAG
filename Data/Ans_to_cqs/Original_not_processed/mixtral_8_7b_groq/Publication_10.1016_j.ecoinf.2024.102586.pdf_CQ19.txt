Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the deep learning models, the frameworks used to build them, or their relationship with ecological informatics, invasive alien species, or diversity metrics.

The context consists of two research papers published in the journal Ecological Informatics, both authored by R. Gulzar and colleagues. These papers, titled "Ecological Informatics81(2024)1025862" and "Ecological Informatics81(2024)1025866," focus on the relative roles of various drivers in determining the richness and abundance of invasive alien species in a region and whether the relative importance of these drivers differs between two diversity metrics (species richness and abundance). However, neither paper mentions deep learning models, the frameworks used to build them, or any related aspects.

Therefore, it is not possible to answer the query with the given context.

Answer:::
No information is available in the provided context regarding the deep learning models, the frameworks used to build them, or their connection to ecological informatics, invasive alien species, or diversity metrics.
