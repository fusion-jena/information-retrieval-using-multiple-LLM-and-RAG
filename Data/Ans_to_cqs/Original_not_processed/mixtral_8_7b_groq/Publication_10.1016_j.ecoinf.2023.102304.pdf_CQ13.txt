Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, the text does discuss the optimization of parameters for a land transition ratio (LTR) model used to capture the index response to wildfire.

The optimized parameters for the LTR model include the maximum number of segments used for fitting (MS) and the threshold for the fast recovery event (RT). The MS parameter defines the maximum number of segments used to fit the temporal pattern of land transition, with an appropriate value being 4 for a simple disturbance-recovery pattern. A higher MS value may be required for more complex recovery situations. The RT parameter has a value between 0 and 1 and determines the threshold for a fast recovery event. A higher RT value makes the model less likely to miss a fast recovery but more likely to cause a false positive error.

While these parameters are not hyperparameters of a deep learning model, their optimization is still an important aspect of model training and evaluation. The optimization of these parameters resulted in an improvement in overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of up to 8.4% and 36.8%, respectively.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly answer the query about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, it does highlight the importance of parameter optimization for model performance and accuracy.
