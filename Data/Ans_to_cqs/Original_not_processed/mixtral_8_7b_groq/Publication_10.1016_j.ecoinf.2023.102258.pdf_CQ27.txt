Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning models for the BirdVox-DCASE-10 challenge. However, it does mention that long audio files are divided into shorter chunks during training to fit inside the limited memory of GPUs, and post-processing of outputs was an important aspect of all strongly-performing systems.

Based on common deep learning deployment practices, we can infer that the following steps were likely taken:

1. Model serialization: After training the deep learning model, the model parameters were saved to disk in a serialized format. This allows the model to be loaded and used for inference without having to retrain the model. Common model serialization formats include HDF5, JSON, and Protocol Buffers.
2. Platform selection: The serialized model was then loaded onto a target platform for inference. This could be a local machine, a cloud-based platform, or an edge device. The choice of platform would depend on the specific requirements of the application, such as latency, throughput, and cost.
3. Post-processing: As mentioned in the context, post-processing of outputs was an important aspect of the systems. This could include tasks such as joining detections that span multiple chunks, filtering out false positives, and calculating metrics such as precision and recall.

It's worth noting that the specific details of the deployment process can vary depending on the deep learning framework used, the target platform, and the requirements of the application. Therefore, the above steps are a generalization based on common deep learning deployment practices.
