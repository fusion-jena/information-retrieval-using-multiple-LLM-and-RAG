The provided context does not directly discuss the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of the XGBoost algorithm for land use/land cover classification and forest type accuracy assessment. XGBoost is a decision-tree-based ensemble machine learning algorithm that can handle data bias by design.

XGBoost uses a technique called "regularization" to prevent overfitting and reduce data bias. Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the learning algorithm from assigning too much importance to any single feature. This helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to new data and reduces the risk of data bias.

In addition, XGBoost uses a technique called "column subsampling" to further reduce data bias. Column subsampling randomly selects a subset of features for each tree in the ensemble, which helps to ensure that the model does not become too reliant on any single feature. This can help to reduce data bias by ensuring that the model takes into account the full range of features in the dataset.

The context also mentions the use of the "ABC optimization technique" to enhance the prediction model's performance. While the specifics of this technique are not provided, it is possible that it includes techniques for addressing data bias. The ABC optimization technique could potentially involve techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling to ensure that the model is trained on a representative sample of the data.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss techniques for addressing data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of the XGBoost algorithm for land use/land cover classification and forest type accuracy assessment. XGBoost uses regularization and column subsampling to reduce data bias, and the ABC optimization technique could potentially involve additional techniques for addressing data bias. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.
