Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning frameworks were used to build the model. The CRediT authorship contribution statement lists various contributions made by the authors, such as methodology, software, and data curation, but it does not specify the use of any particular framework.

Moreover, the manuscript focuses on data analysis and presentation, including a table (Table 1) that shows the number of tracked vocalisations of each song structure as a proportion of the whole dataset. However, there is no information about the deep learning frameworks used in the study.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which deep learning frameworks were used to build the model.
