Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no specific data repository link mentioned for the deep learning pipeline used in aerial surveys of African wildlife. The articles discuss the use of deep learning and artificial intelligence for wildlife population estimation, but they do not provide information on where the data or code for the pipeline is stored. It is possible that the data and code are not publicly available or were not stored in a public repository. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to the deep learning pipeline.
