Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it does mention some parameters that were tested during the tuning of the U-Net architecture. These include:

1. num\_layers: The number of layers in the U-Net architecture, which was tested with values of 64, 32, and 16.
2. depth: The depth of the U-Net architecture, which was tested with values of 2, 3, and 4.
3. layer\_rate: The rate at which the number of channels increases in the U-Net architecture, which was tested with values of 2, 1.5, and 1.2.
4. batch\_norm: Whether or not to use batch normalization, which was tested with values of True and False.
5. residual: Whether or not to use residual connections, which was tested with values of True and False.
6. dropout: The dropout rate, which was tested with values of 0 and 0.5.

As for the hyperparameters of the training process, the context only mentions that high-intensity fluctuations of the loss function were caused by the specificity of the algorithm used at the training stage. It does not provide information on the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters used during training.

Therefore, while the context provides some information on the architecture of the U-Net model, it does not provide a complete picture of the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
