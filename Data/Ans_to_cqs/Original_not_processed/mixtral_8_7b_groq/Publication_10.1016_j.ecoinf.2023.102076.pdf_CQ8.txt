Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. The text describes the methods and techniques used in the pipeline, such as the implementation of a hierarchical text classification system using BERT and the preprocessing of text data. However, it does not mention the specific location of the code repository, whether it is on GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other platform. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
