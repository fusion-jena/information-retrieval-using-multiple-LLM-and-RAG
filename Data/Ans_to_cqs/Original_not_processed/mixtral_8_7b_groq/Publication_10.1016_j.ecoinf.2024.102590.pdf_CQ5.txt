Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for this study are not mentioned. The study primarily focuses on the analysis of aerial images of the Kruger National Park (KNP) and the use of historical datasets for land-use and land-cover analysis.

However, it can be inferred that the authors use aerial images of KNP as the primary dataset in their study. They plan to use deep learning methods for mapping land cover or more specifically woody cover using aerial images taken about every two years.

The authors use a supervised learning workflow that involves generating training and validation points from sampling plots within different vegetation types described by Gertenbach (1983). These training and validation points are then used to classify all other segmented objects into woody or non-woody land cover using the Random Forest classifier and GLCM texture metrics.

Therefore, while the specific deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet are not mentioned, the authors use aerial images of KNP and historical datasets for their land-use and land-cover analysis, and plan to use deep learning methods for future analysis.
