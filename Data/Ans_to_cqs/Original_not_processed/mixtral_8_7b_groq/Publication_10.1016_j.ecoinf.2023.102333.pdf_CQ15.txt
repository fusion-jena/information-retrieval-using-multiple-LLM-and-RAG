Answer:::

In the deep learning pipeline, several optimization techniques are employed to train models effectively. These techniques are used to update the parameters of the model during the learning process. Two popular optimization algorithms are Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a widely used optimization algorithm in deep learning. It was initially demonstrated to be effective for Deep Neural Network (DNN) training by Lecun et al. (1998). SGD updates the model parameters by computing the gradient of the loss function concerning each training example. Although SGD can get stuck in local minima, it has been shown that momentum can help overcome this issue by accelerating SGD convergence (Luo et al., 2021).

Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is another optimization algorithm that has gained popularity in deep learning. It is an extension of SGD that adaptively adjusts the learning rate for each parameter. Adam combines the advantages of two other optimization methods: AdaGrad, which adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on historical gradient information, and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp), which scales the learning rate by the running average of the squared gradient (Kingma and Ba, 2015).

Dropout regularization is another optimization technique that has proven essential for controlling overfitting as network depth and complexity increase (Gupta and Raza, 2020). Dropout randomly sets a fraction of the input units to zero during training, effectively preventing over-reliance on individual neurons and promoting the development of redundant representations.

Recently, exponential linear unit (ELU) activation functions have gained some traction for addressing ReLU limitations like dead neurons and slow convergence (Alkhouly et al., 2021; Clevert et al., 2016). ELU activation functions have a non-zero, negative value for negative inputs, allowing for faster learning and improved model performance.

In summary, optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, dropout regularization, and exponential linear unit (ELU) activation functions are applied in the deep learning pipeline to improve model training and performance. These techniques help control overfitting, adaptively adjust learning rates, and prevent local minima issues.
