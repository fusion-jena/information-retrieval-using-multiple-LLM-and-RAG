Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning model used in the study is for classification. The researchers used a pre-trained convolutional neural network called AlexNet to classify vector mosquitoes into different species. The model was trained and tested using a dataset of mosquito images, which were divided into training (80%) and testing sets (20%). The AlexNet model was then compared to three boosting-based classifiers (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Histogram-based Gradient Boosting) and a linear discriminant model.

The study found that the AlexNet model had essentially perfect accuracy and specificity in identifying mosquito species, regardless of picture angle or bug position. The other classifiers had varying levels of accuracy, with Histogram-based Gradient Boosting performing the best after AlexNet.

The purpose of using deep learning for classification in this study is to strengthen entomological surveillance systems for Chagas disease vectors. The study suggests that convolutional neural networks have the capacity to work accurately with pictures of uneven quality taken with ordinary cellphone cameras, making it possible for human expertise and artificial intelligence to team up and provide fast and reliable taxonomic support to participatory surveillance systems with broad geographic-ecological scope.

Overall, the deep learning model used in this study is specifically designed for classification, and it has shown promising results in identifying mosquito species, which is crucial for Chagas disease surveillance.
