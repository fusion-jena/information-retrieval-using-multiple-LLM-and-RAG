The provided context does not directly discuss data bias techniques in the context of deep learning. However, it does mention some data preprocessing and analysis techniques in the field of remote sensing and machine learning that can be relevant to the query.

In remote sensing, data preprocessing techniques like atmospheric correction (Guo & Zeng, 2012) are used to minimize the impact of atmospheric conditions on the data. This can help reduce bias in the data.

In the context of machine learning, the text mentions the use of stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling for Sentinel-2 image classification (Zhang et al., 2020). Stratified splitting is a technique used to ensure that each subset (e.g., training, validation, testing) of the data is representative of the whole. Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to handle class imbalance, where one class has significantly more or fewer instances than another. Oversampling can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class, while undersampling can help prevent overfitting to the minority class.

Additionally, the text mentions the use of a variety of machine learning algorithms, including random forest classification, support vector machine classification, and decision tree classification (Zhang et al., 2020; You et al., 2021). Using a diverse set of algorithms can help ensure that the results are not biased towards a particular algorithm or its assumptions.

In the context of hyperspectral imaging for agricultural applications, Khan et al. (2022) mention the use of machine and deep learning methodologies. While they do not explicitly mention data bias techniques, they do highlight the importance of diverse data collection for improving model performance.

Overall, while the provided context does not directly discuss data bias techniques in the context of deep learning, it does mention some relevant preprocessing and analysis techniques that can help minimize bias in the data. These include atmospheric correction, stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, using a diverse set of algorithms, and diverse data collection.
