The provided context discusses various performance evaluation metrics used to measure the accuracy and suitability of prediction models, but it does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models. However, it does detail metrics that can be used to evaluate the performance of a model, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Absolute Scale Error (MASE), as well as the Coefficient of Determination (R2).

Answer: Based on the provided context, the following metrics can be used to evaluate the performance of a model:

1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values.
2. Mean Squared Error (MSE): This measures the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. It is more sensitive to large errors than MAE, as the squaring operation amplifies the effect of larger errors.
3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): This is the square root of the MSE, and it is used to express the standard deviation of the prediction errors.
4. Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE): This measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values as a percentage of actual values.
5. Mean Absolute Scale Error (MASE): This measures the absolute difference between predicted and actual values, scaled by the in-sample mean absolute difference.
6. Coefficient of Determination (R2): This measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit.

However, the context does not mention any deep learning models specifically, so it is not possible to answer the query regarding the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. Deep learning models typically use different evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, depending on the specific problem and task.
