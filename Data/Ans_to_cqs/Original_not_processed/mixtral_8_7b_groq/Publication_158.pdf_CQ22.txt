Answer: The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including overall accuracy, kappa, and average F1-score. These metrics are used to assess the classification results against the test sample. Additionally, class-specific accuracy is reported using the F1-score, which accounts for both omission and commission error. However, the text does not explicitly mention the use of precision or recall.

The overall accuracy is a measure of the proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions made. The kappa statistic is a measure of agreement between the predicted and actual classifications, taking into account the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, where precision is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions, and recall is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives. The average F1-score is the mean of the F1-scores calculated for each class.

Moreover, the text states that an ensemble of three models was generated, and the average of the final output layer was taken. This suggests that the performance of the deep learning model was further improved by combining the predictions of multiple models, which can help reduce the variability in the results caused by weight initialization and random selection for batch training.

In summary, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using overall accuracy, kappa, and average F1-score, as well as class-specific accuracy using the F1-score. While precision and recall are not explicitly mentioned, they are related to the F1-score, which is used to assess the model's performance.
