Answer:

The provided context does not give information about the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The context mainly focuses on the use of a multiple-instance learning algorithm, MTMI-SMF, for detecting invasive plant species using remote sensing data. It is mentioned that this algorithm can handle variability or imprecision in the training dataset, but there is no mention of the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or Transformers.

It is possible that the pipeline uses one of these deep learning models as a part of the feature extraction or image processing stage, but this information is not provided in the context. Therefore, it is not possible to accurately answer this query without additional information.
