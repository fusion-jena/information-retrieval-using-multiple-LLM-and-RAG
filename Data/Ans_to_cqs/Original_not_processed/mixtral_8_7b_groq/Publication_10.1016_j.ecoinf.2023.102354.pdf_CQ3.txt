The provided context does not include information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the study. The context focuses on the use of various datasets, including TWS, SMS, GWS, SPEI, ENSO, NAO, AMO, PDO, IOD, NTA, STA, and ETA, for exploring the potential of deep learning and machine learning algorithms in enhancing groundwater-climate interactions understanding.

The datasets' spatial and temporal resolution and sources are discussed, along with the methods used for estimating groundwater storage using GLDAS-Noah and GRACE-derived TWS. However, there is no mention of the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
