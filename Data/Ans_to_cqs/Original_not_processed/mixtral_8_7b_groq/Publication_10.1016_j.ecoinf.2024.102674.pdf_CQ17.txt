Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the text does not discuss the specific regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization that are used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text Dujardin, J., Lehning, M., 2022. Wind-topo: downscaling near-surface wind fields to high-resolution topography in highly complex terrain with deep learning. Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc. 148 (744), 1368â€“1388 focuses on the application of deep learning for downscaling wind fields in complex terrain, but it does not mention any regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting.

It is important to note that regularization methods like dropout, L1/L2 regularization, early stopping, etc. are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent over-dependence on any single neuron and thus reduces overfitting. L1/L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights and helps to prevent overfitting. Early stopping is a technique where training is stopped as soon as the performance on a validation set starts to degrade.

Therefore, while the text does not provide information on the regularization methods used in this specific deep learning pipeline, it is still likely that some regularization techniques were used to prevent overfitting.
