Answer:::

The context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as whether a grid search, random search, or some other method was used. However, it does mention that the validation set was used for "fine tuning of hyperparameters and model selection." This implies that some method of hyperparameter optimization was employed, as this is a common use of a validation set in machine learning.

Hyperparameter optimization is the process of selecting the best values for the parameters that control the learning process of a machine learning model. These parameters can have a significant impact on the performance of the model, and finding the optimal values can be challenging. There are several methods for hyperparameter optimization, including grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization.

Grid search involves systematically trying all possible combinations of hyperparameter values within a specified range. While this method is exhaustive, it can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially for models with many hyperparameters.

Random search, on the other hand, involves randomly selecting hyperparameter values within a specified range. This method is less exhaustive than grid search but can be more efficient, as it requires fewer iterations to find a good set of hyperparameters.

Bayesian optimization is a more sophisticated method that uses Bayesian inference to model the relationship between hyperparameters and model performance. This method can be more efficient than grid search or random search, as it uses information from previous iterations to guide the search for optimal hyperparameters.

Without more information from the context, it is difficult to say which method was used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model in this case. However, it is clear that some method was used, as the validation set was employed for hyperparameter tuning and model selection.
