Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit description of a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, the context does provide information on how the models were evaluated after training, which can give us some insights into the overall evaluation strategy.

The models were evaluated using two sets of data: a training set and a validation set. The training set was used to train the models, and the validation set was used to evaluate the models' performance. The performance of the models was measured using three metrics: R-squared (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Relative Error of Prediction (REP). R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable. RMSE measures the difference between values predicted by a model and the values actually observed. REP measures the relative error of prediction as a percentage.

The models' performance was evaluated for rice canopy coverage and leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) estimation. For rice canopy coverage, the models' performance was evaluated for C1, C2, and C3 regions, where C1 and C3 had the largest error and C2 had the smallest error. For LCC, the models' performance was evaluated for training and validation sets.

The context also mentions that the random forest classification method was selected to extract the rice-growing area of Qian Gorlos County with a classification accuracy of over 90%. This suggests that the model performance was also monitored during the classification process.

In summary, while there is no explicit description of a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, the context provides information on how the models were evaluated after training. The models' performance was measured using R-squared, RMSE, and REP for rice canopy coverage and LCC estimation. The models' performance was also monitored during the classification process.
