Answer:::

Based on the provided information, the data repository link for the DeepMeerkat project, which is a deep learning pipeline, is available on Zenodo with the URL <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1213328>. This link was provided in the LeCun et al. (2015) reference, which is one of the references in the DeepMeerkat paper. The data repository includes a default hummingbird model and code for creating new models. Additionally, the code for DeepMeerkat is available on GitHub (<https://github.com/bw4sz/DeepMeerkat>), and an executable for Mac and Windows is available in the 2017 IEEE/ACM second international conference on internet-of-things design and implementation (IoTDI), Pittsburgh, PA, 2017. However, it is recommended to build models using Google's cloud infrastructure for greatest speed and reproducibility.
