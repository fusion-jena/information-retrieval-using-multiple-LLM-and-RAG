Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, as described in the given context, include:

1. Batch size: The batch size is the number of training examples used in one iteration. In this case, the batch size was set to 32. This value was chosen to balance memory limitations and the efficient use of computer resources.

2. Optimizer: The optimizer used in this model is Adam. Adam is an optimization algorithm that can adaptively adjust learning rates for each parameter.

3. Learning rate: The learning rate, in the context of neural networks, is a hyperparameter that determines how much the weights in the network are adjusted with respect to the loss gradient. Here, the learning rate varies with group based on the cosine function's law, typically ranging between 0.0 and 1.0.

4. Number of epochs: An epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset. In this case, 100 epochs were used.

5. Early stopping function: This function is used to halt the learning process if there is no improvement in accuracy after 20 epochs. This helps to prevent overfitting.

6. Loss function: The loss function used is the cross-entropy loss function. Cross-entropy loss, or log loss, measures the performance of a classification model whose output is a probability value between 0 and 1.

These hyperparameters were chosen to optimize the performance of the deep learning model for the specific task of predicting soil salinity based on remote sensing data. The choice of these hyperparameters can significantly impact the model's performance, and therefore, it's crucial to tune them appropriately.
