Based on the provided context, there is no information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context focuses on the Random Forest (RF) model, its parameter optimization, and cross-validation results.

However, I can provide some general information about data splitting criteria for deep learning model training.

In deep learning, data splitting is crucial for building robust models. Commonly, the dataset is divided into three subsets: training, validation, and testing.

1. Training set: This set is used to train the model, allowing it to learn the underlying patterns in the data. The model adjusts its parameters based on the training data to minimize the error.
2. Validation set: Also known as the development set, it is used during the model-building process to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. The validation set helps assess the model's performance on unseen data while adjusting the architecture.
3. Testing set: This set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. It is the first time the model encounters this data, providing an unbiased estimate of the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

There are different strategies for splitting the data, such as:

1. Random splitting: The data is randomly divided into the three subsets. This method assumes that the data is well-shuffled and representative of the entire dataset.
2. Time-based splitting: In time-series data or data collected over time, the data is split based on time intervals. For example, the oldest data is used for training, the most recent data for validation, and the most recent data not used in validation for testing.
3. Stratified splitting: When the data has a class imbalance, stratified splitting ensures that each subset has a similar distribution of classes. This method is useful for maintaining class balance during training, validation, and testing.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, I have provided general information about data splitting strategies for deep learning.
