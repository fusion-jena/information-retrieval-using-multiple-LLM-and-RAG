Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. The context refers to two scientific articles by Wang and Shan (2024) and a series of wildlife harvest summary reports by the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. However, these documents do not mention any deep learning pipeline or its code repository.

The articles by Wang and Shan focus on feature-based and shape-match classifications of animal population time series, using methods such as dynamic time warping, hierarchical clustering, machine learning, and state space models. While they may have used code to perform these analyses, there is no information about where that code is hosted.

The wildlife harvest summary reports by the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks contain data on the number of harvested rabbits in Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) over several decades. These reports may be useful for researchers studying wildlife populations, but they do not contain information about deep learning pipelines or code repositories.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific location for the code repository of the deep learning pipeline.
