Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. The text does not mention any specific techniques used, such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization.

However, it is mentioned that several models were trained and their performance was evaluated. The models displayed a range of F-measure standard deviations, and the models trained on 27 species were selected for subsequent analyses due to their superior performance. It is possible that the hyperparameters of the models were optimized through a trial-and-error process, where different hyperparameter values were tried and the performance of the models was evaluated to determine the best values.

In addition, the text mentions that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Deep Learning approach was used for underwater fish species classification. In the context of deep learning, hyperparameter optimization can be a complex and time-consuming process. Techniques such as grid search and random search can be used to search for the best hyperparameter values, but they can be computationally expensive and may not always find the optimal values. More sophisticated methods, such as Bayesian optimization, can be used to more efficiently search the hyperparameter space and find good values.

Overall, while the provided context does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, it is possible that a trial-and-error process or a more systematic method such as grid search or Bayesian optimization was used.
