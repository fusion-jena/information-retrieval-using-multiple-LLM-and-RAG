Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training in the context of supervised machine learning for inferring animal behavior from location and movement data is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, it is mentioned that supervised learning requires validation of classifications using additional behavioral observations. This implies that the model's performance is evaluated by comparing its classifications to the actual behavioral observations, which serve as the ground truth.

In the context of supervised learning, this process of evaluating the model's performance is typically carried out by setting aside a portion of the training data as a validation or test set. The model's classifications for the validation set are then compared to the actual behavioral observations to calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model is performing and can help identify any issues or biases in the model's classifications.

Moreover, the text highlights the importance of behavioral observations in supervised learning, stating that the lack or shortage of behavioral observations limits its applications in behavioral studies. This further emphasizes the need for monitoring the model's performance during training to ensure that it is accurately capturing the behaviors of interest.

In summary, while the specific strategy for monitoring the model's performance during training is not mentioned, it is clear that supervised learning in this context involves evaluating the model's classifications against actual behavioral observations, and setting aside a validation or test set is a common approach for doing so.
