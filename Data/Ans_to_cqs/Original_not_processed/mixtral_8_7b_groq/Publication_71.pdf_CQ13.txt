Answer:::
The deep learning model in question is DeepLabV3+, and the hyperparameters used in its training are provided in Table 1. The learning policy is set to "Poly," which is a type of learning rate scheduler. The base learning rate is 0.0001, and the learning rate decay factor is 0.1. The learning rate decay step is 2000, and the learning power is 0.9. The training number of steps is greater than or equal to 100,000. The momentum is set to 0.9, and the train batch size is 2. The weight decay is 0.00004, and the train crop size is '513,513'. The last layer gradient multiplier is 1, and the upsample logits is set to True. The drop path keep prob is 1. The tf\_initial\_checkpoint is set to "deeplabv3\_pascal\_train\_aug," and the initialize\_last\_layer is False. The last\_layers\_contain\_logits\_only is True. The slow\_start\_step is 0, and the slow\_start\_learning\_rate is 1e-4. The fine\_tune\_batch\_norm is False. The min\_scale\_factor is 0.5, the max\_scale\_factor is 2, the scale\_factor\_step\_size is 0.25, and the atrous\_rates are [6,12,18]. The output stride is 16.

It is worth noting that the DeepLabV3+ architecture is originally designed for three input channels (RGB), and it needs to be adjusted accordingly to accommodate four-channel input images, such as RGB-NIR. Additionally, for efficient model training, larger batch sizes are recommended, but this requires significant GPU power.
