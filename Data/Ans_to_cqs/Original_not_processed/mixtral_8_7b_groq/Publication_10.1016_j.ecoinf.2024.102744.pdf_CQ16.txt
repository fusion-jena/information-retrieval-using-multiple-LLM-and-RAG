Answer:::
The context provided does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, in many machine learning scenarios, training is often stopped when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model is overfitting to the training data. This is a common practice to prevent the model from learning the noise in the training data and to ensure its generalization ability. Another approach is to use early stopping, where training is halted if the validation loss does not improve for a certain number of epochs. The specific criteria used can vary depending on the problem, the model, and the data.
