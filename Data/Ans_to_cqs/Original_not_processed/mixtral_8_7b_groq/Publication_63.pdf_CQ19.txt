Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific information about the deep learning framework used to build the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. The text mentions the use of pre-trained layer weights from a classification task, and the creation of a regressor following the basic CNN structure, but it does not specify the framework in which these processes were carried out. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
