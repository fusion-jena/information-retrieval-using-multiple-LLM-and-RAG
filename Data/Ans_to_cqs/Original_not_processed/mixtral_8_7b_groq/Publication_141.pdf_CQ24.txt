Based on the provided context, there are a few strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, although the text does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value.

Firstly, the authors used transfer learning, which is a technique where a pre-trained model is used as a starting point for a new task. This can help reduce the amount of randomness that comes from initializing the weights of the network randomly. By using a pre-trained model, the authors can leverage the knowledge that the model has already gained from a large dataset like ImageNet, and apply it to their specific task of chironomid identification.

Secondly, the authors used data augmentation, which is a technique where artificial data is generated from the existing dataset by applying random transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping. This can help increase the size of the dataset and reduce overfitting, which is a common problem in deep learning where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. By applying random transformations to the data, the authors can create new examples that the model has not seen before, which can help reduce the amount of randomness that comes from having a small dataset.

Thirdly, the authors used dropout, which is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training. This can help prevent overfitting by reducing the capacity of the model and introducing some randomness into the training process. By ignoring randomly selected neurons, the authors can prevent the model from becoming too reliant on any one neuron, which can help improve its ability to generalize to new data.

Finally, the authors used a ResNet-50 network architecture, which is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) that has been shown to be effective for image classification tasks. ResNet-50 represents a midsize solution in the ResNet palette that combines both representation power and lower complexity, allowing for relatively fast training of the models. By using a well-established network architecture, the authors can reduce the amount of randomness that comes from experimenting with different network architectures.

In summary, the authors employed several strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, including transfer learning, data augmentation, dropout, and the use of a well-established network architecture. While the text does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, these strategies can help reduce the amount of randomness that comes from other sources and improve the performance of the model.
