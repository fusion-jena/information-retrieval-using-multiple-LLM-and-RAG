Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the specific criteria used to determine when the training of the improved KNN algorithm is complete. The text does not mention any validation loss plateau or other common convergence criteria for machine learning models.

However, it does provide details about the segmentation results for individual mangrove trees using the improved KNN algorithm. The algorithm seems to be based on certain growth characteristics of mangroves, with an empirical threshold set at 0.7 m. It is possible that the training of the algorithm is determined by the accuracy of the segmentation results or other performance metrics specific to this study.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when the training of the improved KNN algorithm is complete, it is possible that the training is assessed based on the performance of the segmentation results for individual mangrove trees.
