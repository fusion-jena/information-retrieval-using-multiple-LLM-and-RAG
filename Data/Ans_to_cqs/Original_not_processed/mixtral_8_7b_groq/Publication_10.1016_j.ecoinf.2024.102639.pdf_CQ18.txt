Answer: During the training of the SVM model, a strategy was implemented to monitor the model's performance by utilizing cross-validation error. This method involves dividing the dataset into subsets, training the model on a portion of the data, and then testing its precision on the remaining subset. This process is repeated multiple times, with each iteration using a different subset for testing. The average error across all iterations, known as the cross-validation error, is then calculated. This metric was used to ascertain the configuration that minimizes this error, thereby enhancing the model's precision. Additionally, the regularization parameter ('C') and the kernel type (linear) were calibrated through a combined application of grid search and cross-validation. This approach aimed to balance the model's complexity and its generalization ability, which are crucial factors for monitoring the model's performance during training. Furthermore, the selection of the distance metric, typically Euclidean, was based on the data's characteristics and specific analytical requirements. This was done to ensure that the distilled dataset retained the majority of the original data's variance, which is essential for monitoring the model's performance. The integration of these strategies provided a comprehensive approach to monitor the model's performance during training, thereby ensuring the production of a robust and accurate model.
