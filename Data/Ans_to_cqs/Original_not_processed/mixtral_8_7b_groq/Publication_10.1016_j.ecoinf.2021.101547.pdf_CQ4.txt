Answer:::
In the provided context, the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, based on the common practices in deep learning, it can be inferred that data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling were likely applied.

Data augmentation is a crucial step in deep learning to increase the diversity of the training data and prevent overfitting. It involves creating modified versions of the existing images in the training set by applying various transformations. Some common data augmentation techniques include:

1. Flipping: This involves horizontally or vertically flipping the images in the training set. Flipping the images helps the model learn features that are invariant to the direction of the object in the image.
2. Rotating: This involves rotating the images in the training set by a certain angle. Rotating the images helps the model learn features that are invariant to the orientation of the object in the image.
3. Scaling: This involves resizing the images in the training set by a certain scale factor. Scaling the images helps the model learn features that are invariant to the size of the object in the image.

These techniques can be applied in isolation or in combination to create a diverse set of training images. The specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline would depend on the nature of the dataset and the specific problem being addressed.

In the provided context, it is mentioned that the mini-batch size is limited by the amount of memory available to the GPU. Data augmentation techniques can help increase the diversity of the training data without significantly increasing the size of the dataset, making it possible to train the model with a larger mini-batch size.

Therefore, while the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling were likely applied to increase the diversity of the training data and prevent overfitting.
