Answer:::
Deep learning models often contain elements of randomness, which can affect their training and performance. Strategies to handle this randomness include setting a random seed value, data shuffling, and dropout.

A fixed random seed value ensures consistent and reproducible results by initializing random number generators in the same way during different runs of the model. This is particularly important for experiments and comparative studies, as it allows for fair evaluation of model performance. For example, in the paper "Deep learning based feature extraction for texture classification" by Simon and Uma (2020), a random seed value was set to ensure consistent feature extraction.

Data shuffling is another strategy used to handle randomness in deep learning. It involves randomly rearranging the order of training samples before each epoch, which helps prevent overfitting and improves model generalization. In the paper "Land cover classification in a complex urban-rural landscape with quickbird imagery" by Lu, Hetrick, and Moran (2010), data shuffling was applied during the training of a support vector machine classifier.

Dropout is a regularization technique used in deep learning to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out, or deactivating, a proportion of neurons during training. This encourages the model to learn more robust features and reduces the risk of over-reliance on specific neurons. In the paper "A graded proportion method of training sample selection for updating conventional soil maps" by Liu et al. (2020), dropout was used during the training of a convolutional neural network.

In summary, strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include setting a random seed value, data shuffling, and dropout. These techniques help ensure reproducibility, improve model generalization, and prevent overfitting.
