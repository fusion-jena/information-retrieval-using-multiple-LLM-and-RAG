Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context focuses on the use of a deep learning algorithm called U-net to identify and map canopy palm trees in the Brazilian Amazon forest using high-resolution multispectral images from the GeoEye satellite. The study resulted in a map with an overall accuracy of 95.5% and an F1-score of 0.7, indicating that the algorithm performed well in segmenting and mapping canopy palms. However, the context does not mention where the data and code for the deep learning pipeline are stored or how they can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a data repository for this study.
