Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for annotating wetlands on a map and evaluating its performance using a 10-fold cross validation. It also mentions that the trained models are used to generate a GIS layer of the historical geographical distribution of wetlands in southern Sweden, which is released as an open resource. However, there is no information about where the data used in this study is stored or shared. Therefore, I am unable to answer this query without additional context.
