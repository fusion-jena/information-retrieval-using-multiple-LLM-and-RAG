Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model of BirdNET. The hyperparameters mentioned in the context are detection sensitivity, overlap of prediction segments, and minimum confidence threshold. These hyperparameters are set to 1.5, 1.5 seconds, and 0.4 respectively. However, the learning rate and optimizer are crucial hyperparameters in a deep learning model that significantly affect the training process and model performance. Therefore, without this information, it is not possible to provide a complete answer to the query.
