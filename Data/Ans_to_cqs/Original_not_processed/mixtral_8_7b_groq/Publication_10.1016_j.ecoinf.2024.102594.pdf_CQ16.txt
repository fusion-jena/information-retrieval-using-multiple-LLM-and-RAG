Answer:::
The training process of the DeepLabV3+ model is terminated when there is no decrease in the validation loss value after 10 consecutive epochs. This is determined using the ReduceLROnPlateau strategy, which reduces the learning rate by half if the validation loss does not decrease after 5 consecutive epochs. If the validation loss still does not decrease after another 5 epochs, the training process is stopped. This approach ensures that the model does not continue learning when it is no longer improving, preventing overfitting and reducing training time.
