Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam used in deep learning pipelines in the ibis.iSDM modeling. The engines supported by ibis.iSDM are primarily focused on regression-based and non-parametric machine learning approaches, including regularized elastic net regressions, Bayesian regularized “Spike-and-Slab” regressions, Bayesian additive regression trees, monotonic gradient descent boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. However, these engines do not explicitly include optimization techniques typically associated with deep learning pipelines.

It is important to note that the ibis.iSDM package focuses on species distribution modeling (SDM), which may not necessarily involve deep learning techniques. While deep learning has been increasingly applied in various fields, including ecology and biodiversity modeling, the context provided here is specific to the ibis.iSDM package and its supported engines for SDM.

Answer:::
The ibis.iSDM package primarily supports regression-based and non-parametric machine learning approaches for species distribution modeling, without explicitly mentioning optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines such as SGD or Adam.
