Answer:::

Based on the information provided, there is no direct link to a deep learning pipeline's code repository, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. However, the context does provide information on various machine learning techniques and packages used in related studies.

For instance, the study by Keshavamurthy et al. (2022) discusses machine learning and deep learning approaches for predicting infectious diseases. Still, it does not provide a code repository link. Similarly, Khun (2022) explains the 'caret' package in R for classification and regression training, but it does not pertain to deep learning.

The main study focuses on a classical random forest machine learning model for predicting tsetse abundance in Kenya. It mentions packages like 'randomForest' and 'VSURF' from the CRAN repository, as well as 'pdp' for partial dependence plots, but none of these are deep learning specific.

In summary, while the context offers valuable insights into machine learning techniques and packages, there is no information on a deep learning pipeline's code repository link.
