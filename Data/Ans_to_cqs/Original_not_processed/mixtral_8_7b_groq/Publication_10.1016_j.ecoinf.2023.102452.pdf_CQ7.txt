Answer:

The criteria used to split data for deep learning model training, such as dividing the data into training, testing, and validation sets, are not specified in the provided contexts. However, there are some insights into data division and selection in water resources applications and data-driven modeling approaches.

In the paper "Optimal division of data for neural network models in water resources applications" (Bowden, G.J., Maier, H.R., Dandy, G.C., 2002), the authors discuss optimal data division strategies for neural network models in water resources. They suggest that the data should be divided based on the available data, the model's complexity, and the application's requirements. They propose using a systematic approach for data division, such as dividing the data into training, validation, and testing sets. However, the specific criteria for splitting the data are not provided.

In the context of ecological models for the European water framework directive, Everaert et al. (2013) emphasize the importance of data-driven modeling approaches and the development of ecological models. They mention that data selection and preprocessing are crucial steps in the modeling process, but they do not provide specific criteria for splitting the data.

In the context of deep learning approaches for short-term streamflow forecasting (Dehghani, A., Moazam, H.M.Z.H., Mortazavizadeh, F., Ranjbar, V., Mirzaei, M., Mortezavi, S., Ng, J.L., Dehghani, A., 2023), the authors compare LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM models for hourly short-term streamflow forecasting. They use a dataset of hourly streamflow records and divide it into training, validation, and testing sets, but the specific criteria for splitting the data are not provided.

In summary, the provided contexts do not offer specific criteria for splitting data for deep learning model training. However, some insights suggest that data division should be based on the available data, the model's complexity, and the application's requirements. Data selection and preprocessing are also crucial steps in the modeling process.
