Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline for classifying seagrass meadows appears to primarily use image data as input. Specifically, it mentions the use of seasonal images to improve the accuracy of the classification models. However, it also suggests the potential value of incorporating multisource data, such as environmental data that characterizes the ecology of these species. This could imply the use of additional data formats like CSV files for tabular data.

Another point to consider is that the context mentions previous studies analyzing seagrass meadows distribution that used remote sensing sources. While not explicitly stated, this could potentially include other types of data formats like video or audio, depending on the specific methods used in those studies.

However, the primary focus of the provided context is on image data and the inclusion of seasonal images in particular. Therefore, it seems safe to conclude that image data is the primary format used in this deep learning pipeline. The potential use of additional data formats like CSV files or other remote sensing sources is only implied and not explicitly stated.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline for classifying seagrass meadows primarily uses image data as input, with the potential inclusion of additional data formats like CSV files or other remote sensing sources.
