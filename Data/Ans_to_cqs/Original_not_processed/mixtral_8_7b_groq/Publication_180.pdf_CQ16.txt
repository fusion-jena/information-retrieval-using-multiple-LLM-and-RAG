Answer:::

In the context provided, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly stated as being based on validation loss plateauing. However, it is mentioned that the number of training steps was adjusted to find an optimum balance between computing time and classification efficiency. This suggests that the training process involved monitoring the performance of the model as it was trained over a number of steps and making a decision about when to stop training based on this performance.

In the case of the Mexican dataset, the optimum number of training steps was determined to be 2,000, as this resulted in an 83.0% overall identification rate and represented a good balance between processing time and classification performance. It is possible that the decision to stop training at 2,000 steps was based on the fact that there was no significant improvement in identification rate beyond this point, or that the rate of improvement had slowed significantly.

In general, one common criterion for determining when training is complete in deep learning models is to monitor the validation loss and stop training when it stops decreasing or starts increasing, indicating that the model is starting to overfit to the training data. This is known as early stopping. However, in the context provided, it is not clear whether this specific criterion was used.

In summary, while the specific criteria used to determine when training was complete in the TensorFlow models used in the project are not explicitly stated in the provided context, it is mentioned that the number of training steps was adjusted to find an optimum balance between computing time and classification efficiency. This suggests that the training process involved monitoring the performance of the model as it was trained over a number of steps and making a decision about when to stop training based on this performance.
