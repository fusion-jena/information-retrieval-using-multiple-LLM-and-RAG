Answer:::

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the descriptions of the layers in the model, which include convolution layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. These are all typical layers found in a CNN. Additionally, the use of the term "inception modules" also suggests a CNN architecture, as this term is commonly associated with the GoogLeNet CNN model. The inception modules consist of convolution modules and a pooling module, which are all components of a CNN. Furthermore, the use of filters with a specific size (e.g., 3x3 filters) and the mention of strides in the convolution layers also indicate the use of a CNN. Therefore, based on the provided context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN.
