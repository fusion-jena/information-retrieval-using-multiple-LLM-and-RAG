Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline used in the study mentioned in the context utilizes image data format as its input. The research focuses on semantic segmentation for remote sensing applications, and therefore, the data used for training and testing the deep learning models are images. The images are divided into input patches of size 256 × 256 pixels, and a total of 1938 patches are used for the analysis. Among these, 388 patches are used for testing, 1162 for training, and 388 for validation. The study did not mention using any other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files.

It is important to note that the deep learning models used in this study are implemented using TensorFlow, a Python framework that allows efficient analysis and implementation of deep learning with Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The experiments were conducted on a 64-bit Intel i7-8700K@3.70GHz CPU workstation, 64 GB memory, and NVIDIA® GTX 1080 GPU with 12Gb of memory, under a Debian 4.195.98-1 version operating system.

Furthermore, the study evaluated four different deep learning-based models, including FCN, U-Net, SegNet, and DeepLabV3+. Among these, DeepLabV3+ has the highest number of parameters, which is approximately 2.75 times more than U-Net, the least requiring one. The need for a higher number of parameters in DeepLabV3+ implies a higher demand for training samples. However, the study did not mention whether the dataset used for training the models was sufficient or not.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline used in the study mentioned in the context utilizes image data format as its input. The study did not mention using any other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV files.
