Answer:::
The specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the system uses neural networks for species identification and animal detection. Given the popularity and success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer vision tasks, it is highly likely that a CNN or a variant of it is used in this system. CNNs are often the go-to choice for image classification and object detection tasks due to their ability to effectively learn spatial hierarchies of features in images.

Moreover, the context mentions the use of YOLOv4, which is a well-known CNN-based object detection model. YOLOv4 is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect objects in images and videos. It is designed to provide high accuracy while maintaining real-time performance, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices.

In summary, while the exact type of deep learning model is not specified, the use of YOLOv4 and the nature of the problem suggest that a convolutional neural network is used in the pipeline for species identification and animal detection.
