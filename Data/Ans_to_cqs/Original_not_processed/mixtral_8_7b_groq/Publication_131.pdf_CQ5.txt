Answer:

The context provided does not give information about the specific datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet) used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe the creation and use of a custom dataset for a specific task - the classification of anuran calls using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

In this task, the dataset consists of 865 audio samples of anuran calls, which were augmented to generate 10 additional audios for each sample, resulting in a total of 9515 samples. For the training set, 80% of the samples were used (7623 samples), and for the test set, 20% of the samples were used (1892 samples). A balanced sampling was carried out for the test set, where one audio sample out of five was selected for each type of anuran call.

Therefore, while the specific datasets commonly used in deep learning pipelines are not mentioned, the context does provide information about the creation and use of a custom dataset for a specific task.
