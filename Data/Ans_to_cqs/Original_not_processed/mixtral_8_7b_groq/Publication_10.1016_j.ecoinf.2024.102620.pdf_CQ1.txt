Answer:

The study by Zhang et al. (2024) utilizes various methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, including the use of sensors, public datasets, and possibly surveys.

Firstly, the study obtained remote sensing data from Google Earth Engine, which includes Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data. NDVI is a commonly used vegetation index that can be derived from satellite or aerial imagery, and it is often used to assess vegetation health and cover (Congalton et al., 2014). DEM data, on the other hand, represents the earth's surface topography and can be used to derive various terrain attributes (Glenn et al., 2008). These data were obtained from sensors onboard satellites or aircraft, which continuously collect data and provide public access to it.

Secondly, the study obtained meteorological data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). These datasets provide historical and near-real-time data on various meteorological variables, such as temperature, precipitation, and radiation. These data are collected through a network of ground-based sensors and satellites, which provide global coverage and high-temporal resolution data.

Thirdly, the study obtained road and GDP data from OpenStreetMap and the Resource and Environmental Science Data Center (RESDC), respectively. OpenStreetMap is a collaborative project that creates and provides free geographic data, including road data (Haklay and Weber, 2008). RESDC provides various environmental and socio-economic data, including GDP data, which can be used to assess regional development and economic activities (Wang et al., 2016). These data are collected through various sources, including surveys, administrative records, and remote sensing.

Lastly, the study obtained population data from RESDC, which can be used to assess demographic characteristics and population distribution. Population data can be collected through various methods, including censuses, surveys, and administrative records (UN, 2018).

In summary, the study by Zhang et al. (2024) utilized various methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, including the use of sensors, public datasets, and possibly surveys. Remote sensing data, meteorological data, road and GDP data, and population data were obtained from various sources, including Google Earth Engine, Copernicus Climate Change Service, NOAA, OpenStreetMap, and RESDC. These data provide essential information for understanding the study area and developing predictive models.
