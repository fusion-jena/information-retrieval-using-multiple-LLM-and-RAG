Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that deep neural networks are frequently used for dimension-reduction and image classification tasks. These types of tasks often require a significant amount of computational power and are commonly performed using specialized hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). GPUs are particularly well-suited for these tasks because they are designed to handle large numbers of matrix and vector operations simultaneously, which are the building blocks of neural networks. TPUs, on the other hand, are custom-built by Google for machine learning tasks and offer even greater performance than GPUs for certain types of computations. It's also mentioned that the authors used ResNet-50 architecture, which is a deep convolutional neural network, which are known to be computationally intensive and require a lot of computational power. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the authors used GPUs or TPUs to train their deep learning model.
