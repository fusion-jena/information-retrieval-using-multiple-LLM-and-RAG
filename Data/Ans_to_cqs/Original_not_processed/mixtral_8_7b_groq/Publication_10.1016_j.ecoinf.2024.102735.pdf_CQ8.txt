Unfortunately, the context provided does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. It is not mentioned in the text if the code is publicly available on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query. It is recommended to contact the authors or the organization associated with the study to inquire about the availability of the code repository.
