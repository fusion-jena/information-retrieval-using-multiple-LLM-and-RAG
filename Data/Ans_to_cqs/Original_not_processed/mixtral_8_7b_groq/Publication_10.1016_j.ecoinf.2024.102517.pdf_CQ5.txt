Answer:

In the provided context, there is no mention of any widely recognized datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the authors have created a custom dataset specifically for their research. This dataset comprises clean bird sounds, with the spectrograms displayed in Figure 2. The dataset contains a total of 1568 clean bird sound segments, each lasting between 4 to 20 seconds. For testing purposes, 68 segments were randomly selected from this dataset.

The primary focus of the study is not on the dataset itself but rather on the development and comparison of various bird sound noise reduction algorithms. The custom dataset serves the purpose of evaluating the performance of their deep learning-based bird sound noise reduction network, as well as other bioacoustics noise reduction algorithms, such as SEGAN, WebRTC, wavelet transform, Wiener filter, and MMSE STSA.

In summary, the dataset used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context is a custom dataset of clean bird sounds, comprising 1568 segments, and not any of the commonly referenced datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
