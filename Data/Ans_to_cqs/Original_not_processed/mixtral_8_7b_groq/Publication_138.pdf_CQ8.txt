Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not contain information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes details about a paper published in Mathematical Biosciences and Engineering, Volume 18, Issue 2, 1121â€“1135, which discusses a deep learning model named ICSNet. However, there is no mention of the code repository for this model or the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that the authors have not made the code publicly available or have shared it through a different platform. I recommend reaching out to the authors or the publication to inquire about the code repository.
