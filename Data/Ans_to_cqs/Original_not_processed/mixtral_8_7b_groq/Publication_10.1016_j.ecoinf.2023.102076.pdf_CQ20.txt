The context provided does not give specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the training was done using computational resources powerful enough to handle deep learning models, but the exact type of hardware is not specified. The study focused more on the use of active learning to select training data and the impact of data selection methods on the performance of BERT models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
