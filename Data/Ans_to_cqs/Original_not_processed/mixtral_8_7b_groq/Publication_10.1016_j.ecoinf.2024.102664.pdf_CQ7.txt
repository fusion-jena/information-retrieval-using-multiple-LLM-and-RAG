Answer:::

The data used for training the deep learning models in this study is split into three parts: data from 2003 to 2020 for training, 2021 data for validation, and 2022 data for testing. This means that the deep learning models are initially trained using historical data from 2003 to 2020. The effectiveness of these models is then assessed using validation data from 2021. Once the structures and hyperparameters of the models have been determined based on the validation data forecasts, the models are finally tested using unseen data from 2022. This approach allows for the evaluation of the models' performance in making predictions for future years based on their training and validation using past data.
