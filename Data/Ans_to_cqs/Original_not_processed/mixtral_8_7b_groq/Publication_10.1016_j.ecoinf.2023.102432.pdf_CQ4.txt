The provided context does not give specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the challenge of using machine learning algorithms for ecological and conservation applications, particularly when dealing with impure or non-representative training data.

The study focuses on detecting invasive plant species using multispectral airborne and satellite imagery, specifically the Brazilian peppertree in the Everglades National Park. The researchers used a multiple-instance learning algorithm, which allows for variability or imprecision in the training dataset, to achieve over 70% accuracy in detecting the invader using NAIP, RapidEye, and Landsat 8 imagery.

The text does not mention data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it does discuss the challenges of matching training data collected in the field or high spatial resolution imagery to pixels in the target imagery. These challenges include the imperfect nature of training data, which can arise from issues such as the invader not forming dense or large stands on the landscape or the phenology of the invader resulting in cover changes.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it does discuss the challenges of using machine learning algorithms for ecological and conservation applications, particularly when dealing with impure or non-representative training data. The study focuses on detecting invasive plant species using multispectral airborne and satellite imagery and uses a multiple-instance learning algorithm to achieve high accuracy.
