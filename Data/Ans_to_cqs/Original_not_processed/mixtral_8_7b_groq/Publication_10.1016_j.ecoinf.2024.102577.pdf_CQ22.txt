The text provided does not give information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. It does, however, mention that Random Forest was used to build the prediction models, and that the mean accuracies and standard deviations of 5 Ã— 10-fold cross-validations for each method and species are shown in Table 4. However, it does not specify if accuracy is the only metric used or if other metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, or AUC-ROC were also used. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
