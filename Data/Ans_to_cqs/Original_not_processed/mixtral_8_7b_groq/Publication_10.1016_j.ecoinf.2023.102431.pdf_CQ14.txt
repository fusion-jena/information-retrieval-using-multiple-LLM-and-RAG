Based on the provided context, there is no information given about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text describes the use of a stepwise variable selection procedure and linear discriminant analysis to classify species or sex, and the generation of uncertainty bands and probability values for classification. However, it does not mention any specific methods for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
