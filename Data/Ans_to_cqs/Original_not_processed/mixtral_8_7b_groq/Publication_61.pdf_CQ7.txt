Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for training the deep learning model. The context focuses on the details of the data augmentation process, the dataset extension, and the hyperparameters used for training the model.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to split the data into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

In the given context, the authors mentioned that they trained the network with the Adam optimizer on a specific machine with hyperparameters set to learning rate 0.01, number of epochs 150, and batch size 2500. They also discussed the data augmentation process and dataset extension, but they did not mention any specific criteria for splitting the data.

Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query.
