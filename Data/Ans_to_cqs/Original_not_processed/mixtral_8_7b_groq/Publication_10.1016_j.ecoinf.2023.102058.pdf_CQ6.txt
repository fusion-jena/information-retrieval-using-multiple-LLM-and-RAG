When it comes to training deep learning models, there are several preprocessing steps that are often involved, including normalization, scaling, and cleaning. These steps are crucial in preparing the data for the model and can significantly impact the model's performance.

Normalization is the process of scaling numeric columns to a specific range, usually between 0 and 1. This is important because deep learning models are sensitive to the scale of the input features. If the features have different scales, the model may give more importance to the features with larger scales, which can lead to suboptimal performance. Normalization ensures that all features are on the same scale, allowing the model to treat them equally.

Scaling is similar to normalization, but it involves scaling the features to a specific standard deviation, usually 1. Scaling is useful when the features have different units, as it ensures that the model treats all units equally.

Cleaning is the process of removing or correcting erroneous or missing data. This is important because deep learning models are sensitive to outliers and missing data. Outliers can skew the model's performance, while missing data can lead to incomplete or inaccurate predictions. Cleaning the data ensures that the model is trained on high-quality data, which can significantly improve its performance.

In the context of hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters, preprocessing steps may also include atmospheric correction. This is the process of removing or correcting the effects of the atmosphere on the hyperspectral data. Atmospheric correction is important because it ensures that the data accurately represents the water quality parameters of interest.

For example, a study by Maier et al. (2021) used deep learning with simulated EnMAP data to estimate chlorophyll a concentration in inland water bodies. The study first preprocessed the data by removing atmospheric effects using the ATCOR-2 algorithm. The preprocessed data was then normalized and scaled before training the deep learning model.

Another study by Novo et al. (1991) used hyperspectral data to relate spectral reflectance to total suspended solids (TSS) in water. The study first preprocessed the data by removing atmospheric effects using the ATREM algorithm. The preprocessed data was then cleaned by removing outliers and missing data.

In summary, preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are crucial in preparing data for deep learning models. In the context of hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters, additional preprocessing steps such as atmospheric correction may also be necessary. These steps ensure that the data is of high quality and accurately represents the parameters of interest, which can significantly improve the model's performance.
