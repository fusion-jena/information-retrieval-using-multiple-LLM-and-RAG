Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the studies. The context consists of academic papers and resources that describe the use of deep learning for image classification, specifically for camera trap images in wildlife research. However, they do not provide a specific link to a code repository.

The studies mentioned in the context use deep learning models such as AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) and other custom deep learning pipelines for image classification and analysis. These models were likely implemented using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Keras, but the context does not provide information on where the code for these implementations can be found.

In some cases, researchers may not make their code publicly available due to various reasons, such as ongoing research, intellectual property considerations, or lack of resources to maintain and support the code. If you are interested in implementing a deep learning pipeline for image classification, I would recommend looking into deep learning frameworks and tutorials available online to get started.
