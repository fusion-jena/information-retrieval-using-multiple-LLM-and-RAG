Answer:::
The provided context does not give information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it is common to use various evaluation metrics to assess the performance of a machine learning or deep learning model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. It is a simple and straightforward metric, but it may not be the best choice when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

Precision, on the other hand, is the ratio of true positive predictions (relevant items that are correctly identified) to the total number of positive predictions (both true positives and false positives). It is useful when the cost of a false positive is high.

Recall, also known as sensitivity, is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual relevant items. It is useful when the cost of a false negative is high.

The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics. It is a more comprehensive metric than accuracy, especially for imbalanced datasets.

In the context of the study, the deep learning model could be evaluated using one or more of these metrics, depending on the specific requirements and the nature of the data. It is important to choose the appropriate evaluation metric(s) based on the problem at hand and the desired model performance.
