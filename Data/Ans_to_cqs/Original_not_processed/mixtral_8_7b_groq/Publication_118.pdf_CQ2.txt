Answer: Based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio. The research focuses on eco-acoustic data, which are audio recordings of ecosystems. These audio recordings are then pre-processed and converted into a specific format suitable for the deep learning model. The context mentions that the audio spectrograms are constrained to 128 Ã— 128 pixel RGB images, which are essentially visual representations of the audio data. This format is used to minimize complications and to test the feasibility of using an auto-encoder-generated feature representation for ecoacoustic analysis. Therefore, the original data format is audio, which is transformed into a spectrogram image format for the deep learning model.
