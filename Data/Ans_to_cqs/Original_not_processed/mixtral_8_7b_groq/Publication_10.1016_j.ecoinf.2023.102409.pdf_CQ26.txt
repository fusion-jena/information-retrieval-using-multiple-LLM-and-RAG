The provided context does not include specific information about techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some preprocessing and training details for a model used in image segmentation for fractional vegetation coverage in arid regions.

The model uses the U-Net architecture, which consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder uses VGG11 as a pre-trained model, and the decoder uses multiple inverse convolution blocks to generate a full-resolution segmentation of the input image. Each convolutional block is followed by a max-pooling layer to reduce the feature map size while retaining essential information.

The training process includes setting the initial learning rate to 0.0001, fine-tuning it through iterative testing, using the Adam optimizer, ReLu activation function, and Dice loss function. The number of iterations is 150, and the batch size is 2.

Regarding addressing data bias during preprocessing, the context does not provide specific details. However, some common techniques used to address data bias include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain characteristics, such as class labels, and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to ensure that each subgroup is represented in both the training and testing sets.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class to balance the class distribution.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves decreasing the number of instances of the majority class to balance the class distribution.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population.

Therefore, while the provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, these are some common techniques used in deep learning pipelines.
