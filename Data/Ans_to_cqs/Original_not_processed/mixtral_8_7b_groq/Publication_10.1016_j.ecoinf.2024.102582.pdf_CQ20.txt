The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform is used for mangrove extraction and other land cover dynamic monitoring research. The GEE cloud platform is known for its superior storage and computing capabilities, which suggests that it likely uses powerful hardware resources such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) for training deep learning models.

Moreover, the study mentions the use of the random forest algorithm for rapidly classifying land use types, which is a machine learning algorithm that can benefit from parallel processing offered by GPUs. However, it does not explicitly state whether GPUs were used in this particular study.

Therefore, while the context suggests that powerful hardware resources like GPUs or TPUs were likely used for training the deep learning model, it does not provide explicit confirmation.
