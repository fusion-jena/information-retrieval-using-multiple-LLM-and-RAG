Answer:::
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the introduction and evaluation of a deep learning method called DEPP, which is used for updating the multilocus microbial tree-of-life with single genes and combining 16S and metagenomic data onto a single tree. Although the text offers detailed explanations of the methodology, evaluation, and error analysis, it does not mention the code repository or its location.
