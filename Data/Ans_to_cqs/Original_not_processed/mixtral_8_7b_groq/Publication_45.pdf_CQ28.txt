Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model for ecological prediction. It only mentions that the study uses deep neural networks (DNNs) for predicting bark beetle outbreaks in conifer forests, and provides code and data for the model. Therefore, I cannot answer this question without additional information.
