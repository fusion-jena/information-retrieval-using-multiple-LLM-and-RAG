Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the construction of CNN pre-training models with multi-view data and the classification of spectrums using the proposed model and classic CNN model. However, it does not mention any strategies for handling data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

In the context, it is mentioned that the datasets are divided into training and test sets according to an 8:2 ratio, but there is no information about whether stratified sampling was used to ensure that the distribution of classes was similar in both sets. Additionally, there is no information about handling imbalanced classes through oversampling or undersampling techniques.

The text also does not mention any efforts made during data collection to ensure diversity and reduce bias. Diverse data collection involves gathering data from various sources, demographics, and conditions to ensure that the model is robust and generalizable.

In summary, while the context provides details about the construction of CNN models and classification of spectrums, it does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.
