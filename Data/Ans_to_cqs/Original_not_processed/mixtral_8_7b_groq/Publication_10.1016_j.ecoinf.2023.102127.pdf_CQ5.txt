Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of the ibis.iSDM package for ecological informatics, which is used for creating less biased representations of a species niche while also accounting for some of the biases that plague biodiversity datasets. The package can use multiple presence-only and presence-absence datasets for inference, and it supports options to use dataset specific weights or factor interactions to account for differences in included datasets. However, it does not specify any particular datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet that are commonly used in deep learning for computer vision tasks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
