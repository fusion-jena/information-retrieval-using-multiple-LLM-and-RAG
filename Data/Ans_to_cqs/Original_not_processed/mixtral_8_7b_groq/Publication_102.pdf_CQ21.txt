Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps applied after model training. However, it does mention some details about model evaluation during the testing phase.

During the testing phase, the performance of Model-1 and Model-2 is evaluated on the test data set. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are calculated for both SSL and elephants' data sets. These metrics are used to evaluate the accuracy of the models' counting predictions.

However, there is no mention of other postprocessing steps such as generating saliency maps, creating confusion matrices, or any other techniques to interpret the model's predictions.

In conclusion, based on the given context, the postprocessing steps after model training include calculating the RMSE and MAE for the test data sets. There is no explicit information about other postprocessing steps such as generating saliency maps or confusion matrices.
