The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the methodology, study area, and results of the research, but it does not mention where the code is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide the specific location of the code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket) based on the given information.
