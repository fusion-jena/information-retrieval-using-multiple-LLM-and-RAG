The provided context discusses the use of machine learning, specifically Random Forests, in predicting reproductive condition in fish, but it does not mention deep learning or the data formats used in the pipeline. However, based on general knowledge of deep learning applications, the data formats used can include images, audio, video, and CSV files.

In the context of the study, the data used is likely to be in a structured format, such as a CSV file, containing measurements of gonadal development from Chilean hake (Merluccius gayi gayi) specimens. These measurements could include histological data, gonadosomatic index, and other relevant covariates.

For deep learning applications involving image, audio, or video data, the data formats used would typically be image files (e.g., JPEG, PNG), audio files (e.g., WAV, MP3), or video files (e.g., MP4, AVI), respectively. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image analysis, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data like audio, or 3D CNNs for video analysis, would be trained using these data formats.

In summary, based on the provided context, the data format used is likely to be a structured format like CSV. However, deep learning applications can work with various data formats, including images, audio, video, and structured data formats like CSV.
