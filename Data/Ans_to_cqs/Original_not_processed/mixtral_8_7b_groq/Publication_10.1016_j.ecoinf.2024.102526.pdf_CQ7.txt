Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation) are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, based on the information given, we can make some educated assumptions about how this might be done.

Firstly, the context provides details about the 'survey bounding box' and 'survey bounding dates and times', which suggests that the data was collected within a specific spatial and temporal extent. Therefore, one possible way to split the data could be based on time or location. For example, you could use the earliest data for training, the most recent data for testing, and data from the middle of the time period for validation. Alternatively, you could use data from one part of the study area for training, data from another part for testing, and data from a third area for validation.

Secondly, the context mentions that there are 'replicates' in the study design. If these replicates are evenly distributed across the study extent and time period, they could be used to create three separate datasets for training, testing, and validation. For example, you could use data from the first replicate for training, data from the second replicate for testing, and data from the third replicate for validation.

Thirdly, the context provides information about the 'type of imagery' and 'image pixel resolution & magnitude'. If there are significant differences in these characteristics between different subsets of the data, it might be appropriate to split the data based on these factors. For example, you could use high-resolution images for training, lower-resolution images for testing, and images with different color spectra for validation.

Finally, the context mentions that the data was collected using 'cameras' and provides details about 'camera exif data (aperture, ISO, shutter speed, etc.)'. If there are differences in these camera settings between different subsets of the data, it might be appropriate to split the data based on these factors. For example, you could use data collected with one set of camera settings for training, data collected with a different set of camera settings for testing, and data collected with a third set of camera settings for validation.

In summary, while the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not provided in the context, there are several potential approaches that could be taken based on the available information. These include splitting the data based on time or location, using replicates, splitting the data based on imagery characteristics, or splitting the data based on camera settings.
