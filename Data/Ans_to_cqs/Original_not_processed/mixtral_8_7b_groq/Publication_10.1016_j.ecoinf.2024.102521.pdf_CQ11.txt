Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no direct link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the studies. However, the papers do mention the importance of data availability and sharing in the field of ecoinformatics and ecological research. The STARdbi project emphasizes making raw and processed data available to the public, and the authors of the studies are encouraged to make their data as open as possible.

In the study by Zhuang et al. (2022), the authors mention using a large-scale arthropod dataset, but there is no information on where this dataset is stored or how it can be accessed. Similarly, in the study by Schneider et al. (2023), the authors used a dataset of arthropod images, but the repository link is not provided. The systematic review by Teixeira et al. (2023) also does not provide a link to a data repository for the studies on automatic insect detection using deep learning.

However, one study, Wang et al. (2020), provides a link to a data repository. The study introduces a large-scale very small object dataset of agricultural pests for multi-target detection, named Pest24, and the dataset is available on the Computational Agriculture website (<https://www.compag.org/>).

Therefore, while there is no direct link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the studies, the importance of data availability and sharing is emphasized in the field of ecoinformatics and ecological research. Additionally, some studies do provide links to data repositories, such as the Pest24 dataset in Wang et al. (2020).
