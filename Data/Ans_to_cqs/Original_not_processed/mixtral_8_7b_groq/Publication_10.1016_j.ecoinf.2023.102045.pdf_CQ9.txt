Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository for it. The article by Rocchini et al. (2023) focuses on the cblindplot R package, which is designed to help color blind people visualize spatial patterns by improving scientific maps. The authors discuss the use of open-source code, screenshots, and other methods to implement functions in the cblindplot package. They also mention contacting developers of other packages to implement functions that would benefit color blind people.

However, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository associated with this study. It is possible that the authors did not use deep learning techniques in their research, or they might have stored their data in a repository that is not listed in the provided context (e.g., GitHub, a personal website, or an institutional repository).
