The provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning models. However, it does provide some details about the architectures of the models and the data they were trained on.

The models compared in the study include LeNet, AlexNet, VGG-19, GoogLeNet, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNet-152, ICSNet, and ICSNet\_n. The context provides information about the number of layers and the output size for each model, as well as their accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, AUC, and time(s) for each model.

The ICSNet model, which is the focus of the study, is built using the inception module from GoogLeNet, but only three inception modules are used in ICSNet. Additionally, more convolution layers are added compared to AlexNet, but the number of convolution layers is less than VGGNet and ResNet. This tradeoff between accuracy and time consuming is the basic idea of the work.

The context also provides information about the data description and the architecture of the ICSNet model. After the first inception module, the second and third inception modules are set in turn, and the output is data with the size of 28 × 28 × 480. Then, the pooling and LRN are performed, and the data with the size of 14 × 14 × 480 is output. The ninth layer is a convolution layer with 480 3 × 3 filters, and the ReLU is selected as the activation function. The output result is the data with the size of 14 × 14 × 480. After convolution, the data is performed by LRN, and then the maximum pooling with a 3 × 3 window and 2 strides is used. The output result is the data with the size of 6 × 6 × 480. The tenth layer is a dropout layer, which is used to improve the generalization capability. The size of the output result is 17,280.

Therefore, while the context provides information about the architecture of the deep learning models and the data they were trained on, it does not provide specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the models.
