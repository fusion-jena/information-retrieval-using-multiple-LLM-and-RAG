Answer:::

The provided context discusses various aspects of deep learning models in remote sensing and agricultural applications, but it does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general information on this topic based on the common practices in deep learning.

Regularization methods are essential to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization introduces a penalty on the model's complexity to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are L2 regularization and dropout.

1. L2 regularization: This method adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is the sum of the squares of all model parameters, multiplied by a regularization strength hyperparameter, often denoted as lambda. By increasing the loss for larger parameter values, L2 regularization encourages the model to have smaller weights, preventing overfitting.

2. Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique applied during training. It randomly drops out, or sets to zero, a certain percentage of neurons in each layer, along with their connections. This process prevents the model from relying too much on specific neurons, promoting the development of redundant representations and reducing overfitting.

These regularization methods can be applied to various deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, which are relevant to the context provided.
