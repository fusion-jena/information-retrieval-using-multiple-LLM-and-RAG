Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific deep learning model used in the pipeline for the biodiversity data project. The text mentions the use of a mobile app called Dive Reporter for crowdsourcing biodiversity data from recreational SCUBA divers, but it does not provide details about the machine learning algorithms or models employed in the data processing pipeline.

The context does mention the calculation of weighted normalized abundance using normalized abundance and effort, where effort is defined as the product of the number of divers and dive time. However, these calculations do not necessarily involve deep learning models.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as there is no information available in the given context.
