Answer:::

The provided context does not contain specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models. The sources mention the use of deep learning for various applications in ecology, such as estimating arthropod abundance, biomass, and diversity, as well as detecting and classifying insects. However, they do not give details about the learning rate, optimizer, or other hyperparameters used in the models.

For instance, Zhuang et al. (2022) and Schneider et al. (2023) discuss the application of deep learning for arthropod research, while Teixeira et al. (2023) provide a systematic review of automatic insect detection using deep learning. Wang et al. (2020) introduce Pest24, a large-scale dataset for agricultural pest detection. Furthermore, Ciampi et al. (2023), Faria et al. (2021), and Gallmann et al. (2022) present studies using deep learning for whitefly abundance estimation, vineyard insect trap image acquisition, and flower mapping in grasslands, respectively. However, none of these sources provide information on the hyperparameters of their deep learning models.

In summary, the context does not contain the required information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models.
