Answer:::
I don't have enough information to provide a specific answer to the query. The provided context discusses various topics related to environmental protection, green infrastructure, waterboundary datasets, and a case study in Miami, Florida, but it does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or any other data repository.
