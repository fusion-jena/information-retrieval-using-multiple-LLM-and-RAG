Answer:::
In the context provided, there is no explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that one step in the process involves evaluating the performance of the trained model by validating it against test images and computing metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1 score, and other relevant measures. This implies that the training process might be considered complete when these evaluation metrics reach a satisfactory level or stop improving significantly.

Moreover, the study mentions that the mAp comparison diagram of different networks is drawn to offer a more intuitive effect when comparing the performance of different networks. The mAp curve of YWnet is substantially greater than the curve of other networks, indicating that the training of YWnet is likely to be more successful in terms of mean Average Precision, a common evaluation metric in object detection tasks.

In addition, the paper describes the improvement of YWnet's backbone by adding a CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) and a novel feature extraction module called SRC3. The results of these modifications are presented in terms of Precision (P%), Recall (R%), and F1 score (F1%). These metrics could also be used as indicators for determining when the training process is complete.

In summary, while the specific criteria for determining when training is complete are not explicitly mentioned in the context provided, it can be inferred that the training process might be considered complete when evaluation metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1 score, or mAp reach a satisfactory level or stop improving significantly.
