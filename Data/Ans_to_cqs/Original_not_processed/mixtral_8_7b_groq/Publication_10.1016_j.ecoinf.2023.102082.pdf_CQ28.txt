Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the description of the data used, such as high-resolution CHM of the Earth (Lang10m) at 10 m resolution derived from Sentinel-2 optical images and LiDAR GEDI data, as well as the methods used for estimating the canopy height. However, it does not mention any details about the cloud platform where the deep learning model was deployed. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query based on the given context.
