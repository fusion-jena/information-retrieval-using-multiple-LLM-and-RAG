Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the text does not explicitly mention the regularization methods such as dropout or L2 regularization that are used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of data augmentation as a technique to mitigate the issue of class imbalance, which can help prevent overfitting to some extent.

Data augmentation involves modifying the existing training data to create new samples, which can help increase the size of the training set and reduce overfitting. The text mentions that this technique was used to modify the class balance and increase the number of examples for the underrepresented classes, which led to an improvement in the overall accuracy of the deep learning models.

In addition to data augmentation, there are several regularization techniques that can be used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Dropout is a regularization method that involves randomly dropping out neurons during training to prevent over-reliance on certain features and reduce overfitting. L2 regularization, on the other hand, involves adding a penalty term to the loss function that encourages smaller weights, which can help prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.

While the text does not explicitly mention these regularization techniques, it is possible that they were used in addition to data augmentation to prevent overfitting. However, without further information, it is not possible to say for sure.
