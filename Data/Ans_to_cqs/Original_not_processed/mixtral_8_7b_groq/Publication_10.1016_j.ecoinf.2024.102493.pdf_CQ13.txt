The provided context does not include information about the deep learning model, its hyperparameters, or its use in the research. The text focuses on the use of the kernel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (kNDVI) and the Geographical Detector (Geodetector) for analyzing vegetation growth patterns.

Hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, batch size, and the number of layers or units in a deep learning model are crucial for the model's performance. However, the provided context does not mention any deep learning models or the specific hyperparameters used in those models.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
