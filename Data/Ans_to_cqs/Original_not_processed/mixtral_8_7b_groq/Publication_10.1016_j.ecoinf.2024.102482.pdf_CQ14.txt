The provided context does not give specific details about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. However, it is mentioned that the number of stacked LSTM layers, the size of the output vectors, and other necessary model hyperparameters were selected through various experiments to achieve optimal performance. This implies that some sort of hyperparameter tuning or optimization was performed, but the specific method (such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, etc.) is not mentioned. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given context.
