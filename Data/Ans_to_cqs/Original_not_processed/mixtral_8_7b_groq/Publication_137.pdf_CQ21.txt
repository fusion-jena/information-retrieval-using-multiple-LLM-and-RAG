Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix after model training. However, it does mention that after model training, the point cloud test set is segmented, and the final segmentation results are obtained. The output files include point cloud geometric partition graphs (SPGs) and segmentation results.

Moreover, the results of the experiments are discussed in terms of overall accuracy (OA) and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metrics. These metrics are calculated during the testing phase, and their values are reported in the tables provided in the context.

Therefore, the postprocessing steps involved after model training, as mentioned in the context, are:

1. Segmentation of the point cloud test set.
2. Output of point cloud geometric partition graphs (SPGs) and segmentation results.
3. Calculation of overall accuracy (OA) and mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) metrics.

It is important to note that the context does not provide information on other postprocessing steps such as generating saliency maps or creating confusion matrices.
