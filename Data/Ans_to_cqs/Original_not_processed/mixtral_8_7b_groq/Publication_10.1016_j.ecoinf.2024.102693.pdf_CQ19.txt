The context provided does not give specific information about the deep learning frameworks used to build the models. However, it is mentioned that the models were trained using certain hyper-parameters, which suggests that a deep learning framework was used.

For instance, the ResNet-50 model was used, which is a well-known CNN model proposed by He et al. (2016) and implemented in various deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Similarly, the transformer-like visual models mentioned, such as ViT, Volo-d1, and ViP-Small/7, were also implemented in deep learning frameworks.

Therefore, it can be inferred that deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or others were used to build the models. However, without explicit information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
