Answer:

The hyperparameters of the models used in the study were optimized by utilizing the validation data for tuning the key hyperparameters for each model. However, the context does not provide specific information on whether a grid search, random search, or any other optimization technique was used. It is also possible that manual tuning was employed to find the best set of hyperparameters.

For the CART model, the maximum nodes hyperparameter was set to its default value (no limit on the number of nodes), as it yielded better results when evaluated using validation data. The RF model's hyperparameters included 264 trees and a bag fraction of 0.5, while the GTB model used 20 trees, a shrinkage of 0.005, a sampling rate of 0.7, and the least absolute deviation loss. The SVM model was configured with an RBF kernel type, C_SVC SVM type, and voting decision procedure.

Although the optimization technique is not explicitly mentioned, the study emphasizes the importance of proper tuning for CART models to avoid overfitting. By evaluating the model's performance using validation data, the researchers determined the optimal hyperparameters for each model.
