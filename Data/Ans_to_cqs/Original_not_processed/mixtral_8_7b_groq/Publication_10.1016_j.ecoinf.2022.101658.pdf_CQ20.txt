Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions the use of the R programming language and environment for statistical computing and a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) but does not specify the hardware used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
