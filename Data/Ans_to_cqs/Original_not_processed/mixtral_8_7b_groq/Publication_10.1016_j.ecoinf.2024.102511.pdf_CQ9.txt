Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it is mentioned that partial data is available on Figshare and Github. However, it is not explicitly stated if this refers to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.

Anne E. Simonis's report "Passive Acoustic Survey of Deep-Diving Odontocetes in the California Current Ecosystem 2018: Final Report" acknowledges the use of machine learning for bioacoustic classification and mentions data availability on Figshare. Similarly, the study by Soldevilla et al. on "Classification of Risso’s and Pacific white-sided dolphins using spectral properties of echolocation clicks" provides a link to their data on Figshare.

However, none of the other sources explicitly mention the data repository for their deep learning pipelines. The paper by Shorten and Khoshgoftaar on "A survey on image data augmentation for deep learning" focuses on image data augmentation techniques for deep learning and does not provide information on data repositories. Similarly, the paper by Stowell on "Computational bioacoustics with deep learning: a review and roadmap" discusses the application of deep learning in computational bioacoustics but does not mention any data repositories.

The studies by LeBien and Ioup, and Yano et al. on species-level classification of beaked whale echolocation signals and the United States National Marine Fisheries Service's report on "2016 Annual Report of a Comprehensive Assessment of Marine Mammal, Marine Turtle, and Seabird Abundance and Spatial Distribution in US Waters of the Western North Atlantic Ocean – AMAPPS II" do not provide information on data repositories either.

Therefore, while some of the sources provide links to their data on Figshare and Github, it is not explicitly stated if this refers to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. Hence, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.
