Answer:::
The deep learning models are built using the PyTorch framework. Specifically, all programs utilize Python 3 and PyTorch for constructing and training the networks. The Mask R-CNN model, which is the foundation for the object detection system, is constructed around the PyTorch detection model of Mask R-CNN. For the implementation of Feature Pyramid Network (FGFA), the PyTorch models are used for the backbone, the Region Proposal Network (RPN), and the head of the Mask R-CNN model. The three ResNet variations are also based on PyTorch detection models, pre-trained on the Kinetics-400 dataset. The primary reason for using PyTorch models is their flexibility, compatibility with PyTorch training functions, and the absence of other dependencies unlike other implementations.
