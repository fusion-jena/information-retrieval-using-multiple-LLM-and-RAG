Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of any specific type of deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer. However, it does mention the use of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model.

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a type of deep learning model, but it is not the same as a CNN, RNN, or Transformer. ANNs are composed of interconnected nodes or "neurons" arranged in layers, and they can learn complex patterns and representations from data.

In the provided context, the ANN model is used without any intermediate layers, meaning it is a simple feedforward neural network where the input layer is directly connected to the output layer. This type of ANN is often used for regression and classification tasks, and it is suitable for the problem of estimating flowering dates based on daily temperature data.

Therefore, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), specifically a simple feedforward neural network.
