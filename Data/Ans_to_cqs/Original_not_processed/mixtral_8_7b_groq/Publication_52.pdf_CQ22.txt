Answer:::
The performance of the deep learning models in the study conducted by Demertzis et al. is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, root mean square error (RMSE), and F-Score, as well as the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve.

Accuracy is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives, while recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. The F-Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it provides a single metric that encapsulates both. RMSE is a measure of the difference between the predicted and actual values, and it is used to evaluate the accuracy of regression models.

The ROC curve is a graphical representation of the diagnostic ability of a classifier system. It illustrates the trade-off between the true positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. The TPR is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives, while the FPR is the ratio of false positive predictions to the total actual negatives. The ROC curve provides a visual representation of the classifier's performance, and it is used to evaluate the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.

In the study, the authors used the above-mentioned metrics to evaluate the performance of two deep learning models, namely DELMF and SCNN, on three datasets: underwater sounds, fishes, and mammals. The results showed that both models achieved high accuracy, precision, recall, and F-Score, indicating their reliable performance. The ROC curves for the datasets were also presented, further demonstrating the models' ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.

In addition, the authors used the 10-fold cross-validation (10_FCV) method to obtain performance indices for the models. The 10_FCV method involves dividing the dataset into ten subsets, training the model on nine subsets, and testing it on the remaining subset. This process is repeated ten times, with each subset used once as the test set. The results of the 10_FCV method are presented in Tables 1-3, which show the average performance of the models over the ten runs.

Overall, the study used a comprehensive set of metrics to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models, providing a thorough analysis of their diagnostic ability and accuracy.
