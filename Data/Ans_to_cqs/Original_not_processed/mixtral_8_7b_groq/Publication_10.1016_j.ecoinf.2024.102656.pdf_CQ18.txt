Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of two metrics: the area under the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS). These metrics are employed to evaluate and compare the performance of individual models and the ensemble model. 

The AUC values are categorized as excellent for values exceeding 0.9, good for values between 0.9 and 0.8, moderate for values between 0.8 and 0.7, and poor for values less than 0.7. Similarly, TSS values are categorized as excellent for values greater than 0.75, good for values between 0.75 and 0.4, and poor for values less than 0.4. 

In this specific context, the AUC and TSS metrics are used to assess the performance of five component models (GLM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, and MARS) in predicting the habitat suitability for three species. The RF model demonstrated the best performance, while the GLM model showed the worst performance. 

Moreover, the model performance is monitored during training by generating the ensemble prediction using a weighted-averaging approach. This approach assigns weights to individual models based on their predictive accuracy on the test data. 

Therefore, the strategy to monitor the model performance during training involves a comprehensive assessment of model performance using AUC and TSS metrics, a weighted-averaging approach for ensemble prediction, and continuous evaluation of individual models' predictive accuracy.
