Answer:

The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The study described in the context used a supervised learning workflow with a Random Forest algorithm in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to classify high spatial resolution black and white aerial images from 1939-1944 of the Kruger National Park (KNP) in South Africa. The study aimed to create a comprehensive view of the park's woody cover distribution about 80 years ago. However, the context does not mention any deep learning methods or data repositories related to the pipeline.

Therefore, I cannot provide a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline because it was not part of the study described in the context.
