Based on the information provided, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the datasets are related to traditional villages in Fuzhou City, China. These datasets are likely to include text data and images obtained from Dianping, Ctrip, and Weibo platforms, which are then processed and analyzed using various deep learning models and techniques.

The text data is cleaned, organized, and scored using NLP technology based on LSTM and CNN. The image datasets are organized into text data and quantified using semantic segmentation based on Hrnet and image complexity calculation based on Matlab. The quantified data is then visualized using ArcMap software.

Furthermore, the dataset is divided into a training set and a test set before constructing the XGBoost model. The SHAP method is used to examine how elements of the built environment, as captured in photographs, influence the sentiment index.

Therefore, while the specific names of the datasets are not provided, it can be concluded that the datasets are related to traditional villages in Fuzhou City, China and consist of text data and images obtained from Dianping, Ctrip, and Weibo platforms.
