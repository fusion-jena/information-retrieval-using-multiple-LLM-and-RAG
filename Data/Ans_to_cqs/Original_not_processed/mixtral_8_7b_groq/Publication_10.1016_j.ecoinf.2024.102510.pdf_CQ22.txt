Answer:::

The performance of deep learning models, including classification models, can be evaluated using various metrics. According to the provided context, the following metrics are used to evaluate the performance of such models:

1. Validation Accuracy: This metric measures the proportion of correctly classified instances in the validation dataset. It is a commonly used performance metric in deep learning.

2. Precision: Precision quantifies the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances among all instances predicted as positive. It is calculated as the true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives.

3. Recall: Also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, recall measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all actual positive instances. It is calculated as the true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives.

4. F1-Score: The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a single metric that encapsulates both.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of various models, including MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, GoogleNet, DenseNet201, InceptionV3, ResNet18, InceptionResNetV2, and NASNetMobile. The performance of these models is evaluated using a 60:40 split of training and testing data, and the results are presented in Table 8.

Experimental analysis revealed that the Fine-tuned EfficientNetB0 model exhibited superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 99.12%. In contrast, the performance of the ResNet18 model was disappointing with an accuracy of 93.24%. Other models outperformed the ResNet18 model.

Therefore, to evaluate the performance of deep learning models, the metrics used include validation accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide quantitative measures to assess the performance of the model on a given task.
