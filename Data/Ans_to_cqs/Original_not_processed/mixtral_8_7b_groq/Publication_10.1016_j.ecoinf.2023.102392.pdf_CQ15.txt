The provided context discusses the use of a deep learning model, specifically the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model, in the prediction and classification of forest fires. However, it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.

Nonetheless, it is well-known in the field of deep learning that optimization techniques are crucial for training models effectively. Some commonly used optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop).

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model's parameters by taking a single step in the direction of the steepest gradient of the loss function. Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) is an extension of SGD that adapts the learning rate for each parameter by computing individual adaptive learning rates for different parameters. Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop) is another optimization algorithm that also adapts the learning rate for each parameter but does so by dividing the learning rate by an exponentially decaying average of squared gradients.

Therefore, while the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is reasonable to assume that one or more of these commonly used optimization techniques were applied.
