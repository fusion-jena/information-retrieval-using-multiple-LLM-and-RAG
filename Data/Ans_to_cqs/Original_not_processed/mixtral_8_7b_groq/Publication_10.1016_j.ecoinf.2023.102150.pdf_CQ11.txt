Answer:::
The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. There is no mention of any link to Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF or any other data repository where the pipeline's data is stored. The context focuses on the description of the workflow, the methods used, and the benefits of using R for the implementation of the pipeline, but it does not provide information about the data repository. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
