Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model used in this study is for classification. The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify different types of animal calls in audio recordings. The CNN model requires equally sized input images, so the audio recordings are preprocessed into time-frequency spectrogram images. The input window size for these images is 2 seconds, which was chosen because it is close to the mean and median template duration for the target call types.

The CNN model used in this study is based on a pre-trained ResNet50 model, which was originally trained on the ImageNet dataset containing over one million photo images across various categories. For this study, only the feature extraction layers of ResNet50 were used, excluding the remaining layers used for ImageNet classification. These remaining layers are referred to as the network "top" and consist of fully connected (FC) layers for learning a predictive model from the input features.

The FC layers in the network top take a weighted sum of the input's values and pass it through a transfer function. The weights of an FC layer are learnable, and in this study, two FC layers were used separated by a drop-out layer. The drop-out layer helps prevent overfitting during the training process.

The use of a pre-trained CNN model for feature learning in the training process eliminates or reduces the need for manual feature selection. CNNs have been shown to be effective for classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on many image-recognition tasks. In the context of this study, CNNs have also been shown to achieve significant performance increases in recognizing bird species in audio recordings compared to other methods based on nearest neighbors or decision trees.
