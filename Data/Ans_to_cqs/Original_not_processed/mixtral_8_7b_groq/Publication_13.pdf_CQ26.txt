The provided context does not directly discuss data bias reduction techniques during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) for addressing divergence between source and target datasets. DANN is a technique used during the training phase of deep learning models, not specifically for data preprocessing.

Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) is a method that incorporates a portion of the unknown target data into the model during training. DANN jointly predicts the class (family label) of the source images and the dataset (domain) of all input images. This technique aims to improve the model's performance when predicting data from a different dataset or domain, which can be related to data bias reduction.

In the context of data preprocessing, common techniques to address data bias include:

1. Stratified splitting: This method involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria (e.g., class labels) and then randomly splitting each subgroup to maintain the original distribution in both training and testing sets.
2. Oversampling: In cases where certain classes are underrepresented, oversampling can be used to balance the dataset by replicating instances from the minority class.
3. Undersampling: Alternatively, undersampling can be used to balance the dataset by reducing the number of instances from the majority class.
4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources, locations, or conditions can help ensure a diverse and representative dataset, reducing potential biases.

These techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, but they are commonly used in the preprocessing phase of deep learning pipelines to address data bias.
