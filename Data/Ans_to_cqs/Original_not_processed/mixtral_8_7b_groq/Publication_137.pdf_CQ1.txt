Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions that the pipeline involves processing point cloud data. Point clouds are typically obtained through laser scanning or LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology. LiDAR sensors can be mounted on various platforms such as ground vehicles, aircraft, or handheld devices to collect point cloud data of objects or environments.

In the context of the paper "Deep-learning-based classification for DTM extraction from ALS point cloud" by Hu and Yuan (2016), the authors use Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) point cloud data. ALS is a remote sensing technique that uses laser scanners mounted on aircraft to measure the distance between the aircraft and the Earth's surface, creating a dense point cloud of the terrain.

Additionally, the paper "Deep learning-based tree classification using mobile LiDAR data" by Guan et al. (2015) uses mobile LiDAR data, which is collected using LiDAR sensors mounted on moving vehicles.

Therefore, it can be inferred that LiDAR technology is one of the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline discussed in the provided context. However, the context does not explicitly mention other possible methods such as surveys or public datasets.
