Based on the provided context, a deep learning model is mentioned as being used in the pipeline, but the specific type of deep learning model (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) is not specified.

However, the context does mention that an "automated deep learning convolutional neural network algorithm" was applied for soil salinity distribution mapping in Lake Urmia, Iran. This suggests that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used in that particular application.

It's important to note that the context only mentions one specific application of deep learning, and it's possible that different types of deep learning models were used in other parts of the pipeline. Without further information, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer to the query.

In summary, while the context suggests that a CNN was used in one specific application of deep learning, it does not provide enough information to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline as a whole.
