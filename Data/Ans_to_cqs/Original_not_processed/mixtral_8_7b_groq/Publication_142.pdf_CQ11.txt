Answer:::

The provided context does not give a specific link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in Pl@ntNet. However, it does mention that the data should be shared following TDWG standards, such as Darwin-Core, and can be shared via the GBIF portal (<https://www.gbif.org>). It also suggests that the metadata accompanying these datasets should include information such as the AI model architecture, technical specificities of the AI model training phase, digital object identifier of the dataset used to train it, AI model version, classification score of each image, date, location, photograph name, and image license. Therefore, it can be inferred that a data repository for this pipeline may exist on GBIF or another platform that supports TDWG standards, but the specific link is not provided in the context.
