Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the methodology and assessment of groundwater (GW) salinity maps in the southern part of Bakhtegan Lake in Fars province, Iran. It mentions the use of the CART algorithm and a deep learning convolutional neural network algorithm for soil salinity distribution mapping but does not specify where the data repository is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
