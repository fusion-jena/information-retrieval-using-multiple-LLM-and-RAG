The text fragments provided do not directly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, they do discuss the use of image data in a study involving plant status assessment using a Raspberry Pi and a SPAD-502Plus handheld sensor.

In this study, the authors used a Raspberry Pi with a Pi Camera to capture images of winter rapeseed. The images were represented in the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color model, and the DN (digital number) values for each of the RGB channels were extracted from the images. Additionally, the study converted the initial DN values to HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) and YUV (Y, Cb, Cr) color spaces. The HSB and YUV color spaces were used to derive new indices for plant status assessment, and the study found that the blue-Cb and red chroma component Cr were the most important parameters during SPAD value modeling.

Therefore, based on this study, it can be inferred that image data in the form of RGB color model images are used in the deep learning pipeline for plant status assessment. Additionally, the study demonstrates the potential of using other color spaces such as HSB and YUV for deriving new indices from image data.

However, it is important to note that the text fragments do not provide any information on the use of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV in a deep learning pipeline.
