Answer:::

The provided context does not contain specific information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of various types of data in different studies.

In the study by Patil and Kumar (2016), color, shape, and texture features of plant leaf images were used for content-based image retrieval for plant leaf diseases. This suggests that image data was used in their deep learning pipeline.

Pavanelli and Loch (2018) monitored mangrove spectra changes induced by oil spills using image differencing of normalized indices. This implies that image data was used in their study as well.

Pisek et al. (2015) estimated seasonal dynamics of understory NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) in northern forests using MODIS BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) data. MODIS data is often provided in raster format, which is similar to an image format.

Qiyou et al. (2021) used hyperspectral imaging for early identification of strawberry leaves diseases with machine learning and spectral fingerprint features. Hyperspectral imaging generates large amounts of spectral data, which can be stored in various formats such as CSV or image formats.

S. Zhang et al. (2024) used UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) multispectral features and machine learning for detecting damage caused by Erannis jacobsoni Djak. in Sibirica Ledeb. Multispectral data can be stored in various formats, including image formats.

Lira et al. (2010) used infrared spectroscopy and multivariate calibration to monitor stability quality parameters of biodiesel. Spectroscopy data can be stored in various formats, including CSV or image formats.

Liu et al. (2006) used multi-temporal high spatial resolution imagery for monitoring forest disease spread. This suggests that image data was used in their study.

M NEA, E SEA, and S SM (2020) mentioned the use of remote sensing for insect pests and diseases management. Remote sensing data can be stored in various formats, including image formats.

Based on this information, it can be inferred that image data is commonly used in deep learning pipelines for ecological informatics and remote sensing applications. Other data formats, such as CSV or spectroscopy data, may also be used depending on the specific application.
