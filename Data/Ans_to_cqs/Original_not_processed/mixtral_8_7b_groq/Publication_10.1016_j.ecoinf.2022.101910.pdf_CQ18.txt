Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during the training phase of BirdNET. The text focuses on the usage and configuration of the BirdNET model, as well as its performance in detecting and classifying bird vocalizations.

The mentioned parameters, such as detection sensitivity, overlap of prediction segments, and minimum confidence threshold, are related to the operation and output of the BirdNET model. However, these parameters are not directly associated with monitoring the model performance during training.

To monitor the model performance during training, techniques such as validation and testing datasets, loss function monitoring, and evaluation metrics (e.g., precision, recall, and F1-score) are commonly used. Unfortunately, the given context does not mention any of these strategies.

Therefore, based on the provided pieces of context, it is not possible to answer the query about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
