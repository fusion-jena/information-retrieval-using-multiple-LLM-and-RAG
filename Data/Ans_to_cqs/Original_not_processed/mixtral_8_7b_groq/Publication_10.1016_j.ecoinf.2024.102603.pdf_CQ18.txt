Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of cross-validation, specifically the leave-one-out procedure. This method is particularly useful for small datasets and helps maximize the use of available data, reduce bias in performance estimation, and rigorously assess model performance. In this approach, the model is iteratively trained on all but one sample and then evaluated on the excluded sample. This process is repeated until every sample has been used as the test set once.

To evaluate the performance of the XGBoost model, several metrics were calculated during the cross-validation process: the coefficient of determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Relative Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE). The R2 metric measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables, with a value closer to 1 indicating better model performance. MAE, RMSE, and RRMSE are error metrics that quantify the difference between the predicted and actual values, with lower values indicating better performance.

These performance metrics provide insights into how well the XGBoost model is learning and generalizing from the training data. By monitoring these metrics during the training process, it is possible to identify potential issues, such as overfitting or underfitting, and make necessary adjustments to improve the model's performance. This iterative evaluation and adjustment strategy help ensure that the final XGBoost model offers accurate and reliable predictions for the ground-measured chlorophyll fluorescence data.
