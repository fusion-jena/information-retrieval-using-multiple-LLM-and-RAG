Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the training and testing times were observed for different models and augmentation techniques. Additionally, the investigation of the BirdCLEF challenge included the assessment of class imbalances using the focal loss in the training process. The models' performance was evaluated based on different augmentation methods, including no augmentation, single augmentation, and combined augmentations. Fine-tuning of ViT models was performed using ImageNet-based weights for pretraining. However, there is no information on how the model performance was monitored during the training process.
