Answer:::

The code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study is available on GitHub. It can be accessed using the following URL: <https://github.com/salathegroup/plantvillage_deeplearning_paper_analysis>. This repository contains the code for the deep learning pipeline that was used to classify plant diseases in the study. The code is written in Python and uses the Cafe deep learning framework. The repository also includes information about the datasets used in the study and the various experimental configurations that were tested. Additionally, the repository provides instructions on how to set up and run the code on a local machine. The researchers have also provided a link to the PlantVillage image dataset, which can be found at <https://www.plantvillage.org/en/plant_images>. This dataset was used in the study and can be used to train and test the deep learning pipeline. The code repository and the PlantVillage image dataset provide the necessary resources for researchers and developers to replicate and build upon the work presented in the study.
