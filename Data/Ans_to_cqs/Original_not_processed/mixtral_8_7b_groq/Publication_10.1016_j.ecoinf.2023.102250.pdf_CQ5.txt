Answer: The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that there are multiple datasets used, which are divided into three groups (G1, G2, and G3) and further divided into several sub-datasets. The original dataset (Ori) is also mentioned, which seems to be the source for creating these groups. Additionally, each of these datasets is split into train and test sets in an 8:2 ratio.

The context also mentions that data augmentation techniques, such as mixup, are applied to these datasets. Specifically, 40%, 60%, and 80% of the original dataset are taken, and 80% of these subsets are replaced with generated images.

In summary, while the specific names of the datasets are not provided, the context describes a deep learning pipeline that involves multiple datasets, originating from an original dataset, and undergoing data augmentation techniques.
