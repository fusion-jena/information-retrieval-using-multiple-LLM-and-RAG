Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the framework used to build the deep learning model in the studies mentioned. The context focuses more on the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and soil property data for land degradation monitoring and assessment.

However, it is mentioned that ArcGIS 10.8 was used for direct acquisition and reclassification of certain data types. This does not necessarily imply that ArcGIS was used to build the deep learning model, as there are various deep learning libraries and frameworks that can be used in conjunction with ArcGIS or independently, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and others.

Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query without additional information.

Answer::: 
No specific information is provided in the context about the deep learning framework used in the studies mentioned. ArcGIS 10.8 was used for direct acquisition and reclassification of certain data types, but it is not clear if it was used to build the deep learning model. Other deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras could have been used.
