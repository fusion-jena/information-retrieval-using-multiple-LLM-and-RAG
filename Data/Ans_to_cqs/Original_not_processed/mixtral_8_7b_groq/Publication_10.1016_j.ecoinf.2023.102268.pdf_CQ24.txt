The provided context does not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a random seed value in the context of cross-validation.

In the process of 10-fold cross-validation, the dataset is divided into 10 subsets, and the model is trained and tested on each subset in turn. The remaining 9 subsets are used for training. This process is repeated 10 times, with a different subset used for testing each time. The results are then averaged to provide a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

The use of a random seed value ensures that the dataset is divided into subsets in a reproducible manner. This is important for ensuring that the results of the cross-validation are reliable and can be replicated. Without a fixed seed value, the division of the dataset into subsets would be different each time the cross-validation is run, leading to different results and making it difficult to compare the performance of different models.

In addition to the use of a random seed value in cross-validation, there are other strategies that can be employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. These include:

1. Data augmentation: This involves creating new training examples by applying random transformations to the existing data. This can help to increase the size of the training set and reduce overfitting.
2. Regularization: This involves adding a penalty term to the loss function to prevent the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data. This can help to reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance.
3. Early stopping: This involves monitoring the performance of the model on a validation set during training and stopping the training process early if the performance starts to degrade. This can help to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance.
4. Dropout: This involves randomly setting a fraction of the activations in a layer to zero during training. This can help to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline in detail, it does mention the use of a random seed value in cross-validation. Other strategies for handling randomness include data augmentation, regularization, early stopping, and dropout.
