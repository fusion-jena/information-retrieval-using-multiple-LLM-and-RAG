Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the code repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the NGEE Tropics project. The text mainly focuses on the NGEE Tropics Archive, the project's data repository, and its features, as well as the FRAMES templates used for data submissions. There is no mention of any code repository, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, where the deep learning pipeline code would be available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
