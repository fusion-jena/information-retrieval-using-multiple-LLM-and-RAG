Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. However, it does state that "Data will be made available on request." This suggests that the data may not be publicly available on a repository like Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, but rather can be obtained by making a request to the authors or research team. It is always a good practice to provide contact information or instructions on how to request the data in the research paper or project page. Unfortunately, the provided context does not include this information. Therefore, I would recommend reaching out to the authors for data access.
