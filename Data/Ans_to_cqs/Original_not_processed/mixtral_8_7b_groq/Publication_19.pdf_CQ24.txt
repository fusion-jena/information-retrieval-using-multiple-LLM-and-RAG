The provided context does not include information on specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does discuss the use of various models and hyperparameters in the context of classifying images from camera traps for wildlife monitoring.

In deep learning, randomness can be introduced in various ways, such as through the initialization of weights and biases, the order of training examples, and the use of dropout regularization. A random seed value can be set to ensure consistent and reproducible results across different runs of the model.

In the context of the provided tables, it is possible that a random seed value was set during the training of each model to ensure consistent results. However, the tables do not provide information on this specific strategy.

The first table, Table II, shows the hyperparameters determined using grid search for four different models: Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, and DenseNet-121. These hyperparameters include the batch size, learning rate, number of epochs, and input image size. While the use of a random seed value is not explicitly mentioned, it is possible that one was used during the grid search to ensure consistent results.

The second table, Table III, shows the best results for each model in terms of model size, accuracy, and F1 score. Again, the use of a random seed value is not explicitly mentioned.

In summary, while the provided context discusses the use of various models and hyperparameters for image classification, it does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value.
