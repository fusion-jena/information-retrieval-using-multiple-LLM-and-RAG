Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of dropout regularization as a method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Dropout regularization is applied in the forward pass during training, where random neurons are "dropped out" or ignored with a certain probability, preventing over-reliance on specific neurons and improving the model's ability to generalize.

The context also mentions the use of pre-trained weights from ImageNet in a ResNet50 architecture, which can be considered a form of implicit regularization. Transfer learning, or using pre-trained models on a new but related task, can help reduce overfitting by providing a good initialization point and reducing the need for a large amount of training data.

However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of L2 regularization, another common method to prevent overfitting. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, reducing overfitting by preventing the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.

The regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, as discussed in the provided context, include dropout regularization and transfer learning using pre-trained weights. Dropout regularization randomly drops out neurons during training, preventing over-reliance on specific neurons and improving generalization. Transfer learning using pre-trained weights provides a good initialization point and reduces the need for a large amount of training data, implicitly helping to prevent overfitting.
