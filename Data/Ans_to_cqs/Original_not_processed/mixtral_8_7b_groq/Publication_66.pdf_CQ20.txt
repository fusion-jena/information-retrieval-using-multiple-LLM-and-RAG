The text provided does not give specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that deep learning models were used and constructed in R using the H2O package. H2O is a scalable and open-source machine learning platform that can run on CPUs, GPUs, and various distributed computing systems, allowing users to build models on their preferred infrastructure.

Additionally, the text highlights the computational power requirements and perceived complexity of constructing deep learning networks as potential hindrances for their use in previous studies. This suggests that the authors might have used high-performance computing resources to train their deep learning models. However, the specific hardware resources are not mentioned.

In summary,

Answer: The text does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It is mentioned that the deep learning models were constructed using the H2O package in R, which can run on CPUs, GPUs, and various distributed computing systems. The text implies that high-performance computing resources might have been used for training, but it does not provide specific details.
