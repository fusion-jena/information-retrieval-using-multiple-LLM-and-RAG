Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about what criteria are used to determine when the training is complete for the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) or the Spiking Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN) algorithms. However, it is mentioned that the 10-fold cross validation (10_FCV) is employed to obtain performance indices, which could potentially be used to determine when training is complete.

In general, for machine learning algorithms, there are several common criteria used to determine when training is complete. One common method is to monitor the performance on a validation set, and stop training when the performance on the validation set stops improving or starts to degrade, indicating that the model may be overfitting to the training data. This is known as early stopping.

Another common method is to monitor the loss function, such as mean squared error or cross-entropy loss, and stop training when the loss plateaus or decreases very slowly, indicating that the model has likely converged to a minimum.

In the case of ELMs, since they do not require fine manipulations to determine their operating parameters and can determine the appropriate output weights towards the most effective resolution of a problem, it is possible that a different approach is used to determine when training is complete. However, without further information, it is difficult to say for certain.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the ELM and SCNN algorithms is not explicitly stated.
