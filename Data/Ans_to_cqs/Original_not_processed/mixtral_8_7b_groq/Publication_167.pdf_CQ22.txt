Based on the provided context, the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are not mentioned. However, it is mentioned that the model's generalization ability is estimated using the testing set, which is a common practice in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model.

In the context, it is mentioned that the model's performance for categories with small sample sizes is improved by generating a relatively large weight for the categories with fewer samples and a small weight for the categories with more samples. This suggests that the model's performance is evaluated in terms of its ability to handle imbalanced categorical data.

In deep learning, various metrics can be used to evaluate the performance of a model, depending on the specific task and the nature of the data. Some commonly used metrics for evaluating the performance of a deep learning model include:

1. Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions.
2. Precision: The proportion of true positives (correctly predicted positive samples) out of all positive predictions.
3. Recall: The proportion of true positives out of all actual positive samples.
4. F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, which provides a balanced evaluation of both metrics.
5. Confusion matrix: A table that summarizes the predictions made by the model, including true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
6. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve: A plot of the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings.
7. Area under the ROC curve (AUC): A metric that summarizes the performance of a model across all threshold settings.

Without specific information on the metrics used in the study, it is not possible to provide a precise answer to the query. However, based on common practices in deep learning, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated using one or more of these metrics.
