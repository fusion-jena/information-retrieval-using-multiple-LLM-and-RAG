Answer:::
The context provided does not give information about the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models. The text focuses on describing the architectures of the models, such as ResNet, DenseNet, DeepLab, and AlexNet, but it does not mention the frameworks in which these models were implemented. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question without additional information.
