Answer:::

The pieces of context provided offer insights into the use of sensors and public datasets in the deep learning pipeline for water quality management.

Wai et al. (2022) mention the use of online sensors for water quality monitoring, highlighting their reliability and cost-effectiveness in detecting water quality trends. These sensors can significantly improve the detection of water quality patterns, although challenges such as incomplete data, sensor malfunctioning, and low-frequency monitoring may complicate the interpretation of ecological patterns. Proper maintenance can minimize the impact of these sources of uncertainty.

Hou et al. (2022) utilized global mapping and remote sensing data to reveal an increase in lacustrine algal blooms over the past decade. This study demonstrates the application of remote sensing data and geospatial analysis in water quality research.

Wang et al. (2023) analyzed spatial and temporal variation in water coverage in the sub-lakes of Poyang Lake based on multi-source remote sensing. This research also emphasizes the importance of remote sensing data in understanding water quality and coverage patterns.

In addition to sensors and remote sensing data, public datasets are also utilized in the deep learning pipeline. Kim and Ahn (2022) used machine learning to predict chlorophyll-a concentrations in the Han River using a public dataset. The dataset included various water quality variables, such as chlorophyll a concentration, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, water temperature, turbidity, water levels, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, chemical oxygen demand of Mn, and ammonia nitrogen.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include sensors (both in-situ and remote), public datasets, and geospatial data. These methods enable the analysis of water quality trends, patterns, and influencing factors, which are essential for effective water quality management.
