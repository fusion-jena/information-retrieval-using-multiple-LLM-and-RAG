The provided context does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the deep learning (DL) model is trained using synthetic data and then tested using real MS point clouds that have been segmented using a methodology exposed in Section 2.3. The ground truth required for validation is created by segmenting a few samples of real MS point clouds. The final fuel model classifications are retrieved using a decision tree scheme where the inferences on real MS point clouds are taken as inputs.

The context also discusses the importance of integrating augmented data simulations during the training phase of DL models, especially when training a DNN model from scratch requires a substantial number of training samples. However, it does not provide information on the specific data annotation techniques used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and others are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, but the provided context does not mention any of these techniques.
