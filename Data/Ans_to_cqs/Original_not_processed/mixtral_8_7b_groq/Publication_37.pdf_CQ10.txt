Answer:::
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context contains information about a study that compares the performance of a "shallow learning" unsupervised dictionary learning method and a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying migrating birds' flight calls. However, it does not provide the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
