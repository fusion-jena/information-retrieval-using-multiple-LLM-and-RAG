Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that the study uses a dataset of around three hundred thousand geolocated plant species observations in France, and that this dataset contains a total of 6,134,016 observations for 1000 randomly chosen species. However, it does not provide a link to where this data can be found or accessed. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested information.
