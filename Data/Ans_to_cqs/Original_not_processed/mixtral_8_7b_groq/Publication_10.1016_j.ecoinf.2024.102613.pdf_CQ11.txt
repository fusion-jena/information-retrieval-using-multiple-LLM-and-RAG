Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no specific data repository link mentioned for the deep learning pipeline used in modern farming. The context discusses the use of big data, machine learning, and deep learning techniques in data analysis for smart and precision agriculture. It also mentions the inadequacy of traditional data management systems in handling the volume, velocity, and variety of data generated by sensors and IoT devices. However, there is no information provided about the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.

The context does mention the use of Figshare, GBIF, and other repositories in the field of ecological informatics, but it does not specify any link for the deep learning pipeline used in modern farming.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline in modern farming.
