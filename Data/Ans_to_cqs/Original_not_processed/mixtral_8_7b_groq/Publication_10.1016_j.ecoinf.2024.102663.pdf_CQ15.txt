Answer:::

In the deep learning pipeline, various optimization techniques are applied to train the models effectively. These optimization algorithms help in minimizing the loss function and improving the model's performance.

One such optimization technique is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) (Gong et al., 2024). SGD is a popular optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters by computing the gradient of the loss function concerning each training example. However, it may sometimes converge slowly or oscillate around the minima.

Another optimization technique is the Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp) (Jansi Rani et al., 2024). RMSProp is an adaptive learning rate method that adjusts the individual learning rate for each parameter. It divides the learning rate by an exponentially decaying average of squared gradients, which helps in faster convergence and better performance.

AdamW is another optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of both SGD and RMSProp (Jalal et al., 2020). AdamW uses the adaptive learning rate of RMSProp and the momentum of SGD. It also includes a weight decay term that helps in regularization and preventing overfitting.

The learning rate is an essential hyperparameter in the optimization algorithm that controls the step size of the updates. The researchers have experimented with different learning rates, such as 0.005, 0.01, and 0.02, to find the optimal learning rate that provides the best performance (Jansi Rani et al., 2024).

Moreover, the learning rate scheduling technique is also applied in the deep learning pipeline, where the learning rate is reduced by a factor after a certain number of epochs (Jansi Rani et al., 2024). This technique helps in fine-tuning the model and preventing overshooting the minima.

The cosine annealing learning rate scheduler (cos_lr) is another learning rate scheduling technique that adjusts the learning rate based on the cosine function (Jansi Rani et al., 2024). It gradually decreases the learning rate from the initial learning rate to a minimum learning rate and then increases it back to the initial learning rate. This technique helps in exploring the loss landscape and finding the global minima.

In conclusion, various optimization techniques such as SGD, RMSProp, and AdamW are applied in the deep learning pipeline to train the models effectively. The learning rate and learning rate scheduling techniques are also essential hyperparameters that help in fine-tuning the model and preventing overfitting.
