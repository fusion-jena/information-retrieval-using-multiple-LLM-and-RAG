Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the deep learning frameworks used in the study. The text focuses on the use of Functional Data Analysis (FDA) for modeling ecological data, specifically in the context of spatial structuration and the pelagic environment. The FDA notions and methods mentioned in the text are related to expressing raw data as functions, using basis functions such as Fourier or Spline, and calculating empirical functional means and covariances.

The study compares its results with a benchmark work by Diogoul et al. (2020), but there is no mention of the deep learning frameworks or tools used in either study. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer the query about the deep learning frameworks used in the study.
