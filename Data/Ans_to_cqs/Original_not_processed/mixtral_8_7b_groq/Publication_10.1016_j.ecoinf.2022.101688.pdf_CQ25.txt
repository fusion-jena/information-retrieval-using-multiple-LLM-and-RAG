Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model in this particular study is for classification. The model is used to classify bioacoustic calls, specifically those from Hainan gibbons and whydahs. 

The authors mention the use of a pre-trained ResNet152V2 model, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) typically used for image classification tasks. In the context of bioacoustics, this model is adapted to classify different types of calls. 

The authors also discuss the challenge of creating and utilizing CNNs for bioacoustic research, which suggests that the deep learning model is being used for its ability to learn complex patterns and features from the call data. 

Furthermore, the iterative process of manually annotating a few examples, using the pre-trained model to find new examples, and then incorporating these new examples into the training set, indicates that the model is being used for its ability to improve its performance as more data becomes available. This is a common practice in supervised learning, where a model is initially trained on a small dataset and then gradually improved as more data is collected. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model in this study is for classification, specifically of bioacoustic calls, and for its ability to learn complex patterns and improve its performance as more data becomes available.
