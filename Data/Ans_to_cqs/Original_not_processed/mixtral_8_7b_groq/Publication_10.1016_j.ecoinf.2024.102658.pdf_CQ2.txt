Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the study does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning techniques in the data analysis pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of machine learning models such as logistic regression and random forest models. The data used in these models includes climate data and physiological data.

The climate data used in the study includes the 27 climate extremes indices defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI) and the 19 bioclimatic variables from WorldClim. These climate variables are represented in the form of observational and simulation data averaged for specific time periods. Additionally, the study uses present-day and future ETCCDI indices derived from results of the Community Climate System Model version 4 (CCSM4), one of the global climate models used in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5).

The physiological data used in the study is not explicitly described in terms of its format. However, it is mentioned that the data is difficult and costly to collect, which suggests that it may be collected through field observations or experiments.

Therefore, while the study does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning techniques, it does involve the use of machine learning models and climate data represented in the form of observational and simulation data. The physiological data used in the study is not explicitly described in terms of its format.
