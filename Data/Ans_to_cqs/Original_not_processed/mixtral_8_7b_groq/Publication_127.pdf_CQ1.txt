Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline typically involves collecting raw data using various methods, such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets. In the context of the provided pieces of information, camera traps are primarily used for collecting raw data.

Camera traps are motion-activated devices that capture images or videos of wildlife in their natural habitats. These devices are widely used for biodiversity monitoring, ecological research, and conservation efforts. In the given context, researchers have utilized camera-trap data from the SS project for testing deep learning techniques in automating information extraction from these images.

In addition to camera traps, other methods for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines can include:

1. Surveys: Researchers may conduct surveys to gather data, such as questionnaires, interviews, or structured observations. These methods can be useful for gathering information on human behavior, opinions, or experiences.

2. Sensors: Various sensors can collect data for deep learning applications, such as temperature sensors, pressure sensors, or light sensors. These sensors can be used for monitoring environmental conditions, tracking objects, or detecting events.

3. Public datasets: Researchers may utilize publicly available datasets for deep learning tasks. These datasets can cover a wide range of domains, such as image recognition, natural language processing, or speech recognition.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline involves collecting raw data using various methods, such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets. In the provided context, camera traps are primarily used for collecting raw data in the form of camera-trap images. These images are then used for training and testing deep learning models for automating information extraction.
