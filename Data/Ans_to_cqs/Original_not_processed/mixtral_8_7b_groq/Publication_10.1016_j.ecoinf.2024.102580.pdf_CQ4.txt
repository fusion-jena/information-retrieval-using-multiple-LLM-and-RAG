Answer: The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline consist of randomly flipping images horizontally and vertically with a probability of 0.5 each and rotating the images by up to 180 degrees. These techniques were used to artificially create a larger training set by manipulating the original input images. Specifically, flipping the images horizontally and vertically helps increase the diversity of the training data by creating mirror images and inverted images, while rotating the images by up to 180 degrees helps capture variations in object orientations. However, the context does not mention scaling as one of the data augmentation techniques used in this study.
