Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as when a validation loss plateaus in a machine learning model. The text focuses on the use of data analysis techniques for tracking animal vocalizations, specifically in the context of distinguishing localizations for individual animals.

In the context of data analysis for animal vocalizations, the text mentions criteria for determining likely tracks, such as the maximum change in Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and the corresponding maximum change in TDOA based on a swimming speed of 10 km/h. However, these criteria are related to the analysis of animal vocalizations and not to the training of machine learning models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in machine learning models.
