The text provided does not give a detailed explanation of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does provide some contextual clues about certain steps that might have been taken.

The model used is a ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that has been pre-trained on the ImageNet database. The authors used this model for feature extraction from images of honey bee backgrounds. They tested different depths of ResNet models, including ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101, and found that ResNet-50 had a marginally higher validation accuracy, so they chose it for their task.

The ResNet-50 model is made up of five convolutional blocks stacked on top of each other, with the image features being extracted from the fully connected layers. The input to the network is an image of 224x224 pixels.

The training times for the pre-trained ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101 models are compared in Table 1. The training time for ResNet-50 is 1.2 seconds, which is comparable to the other models.

The text also mentions that softmax took 12 minutes to complete the same task on the GPU, but the proposed method has advantages. It is not clear from the text whether the softmax model is a different deep learning model or a post-processing step for the ResNet-50 model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can infer that the following steps might have been taken to deploy the trained deep learning model:

1. Pre-training the ResNet-50 model on the ImageNet database for feature extraction.
2. Comparing the training times and validation accuracies of different depths of ResNet models to choose the best model for the task.
3. Extracting image features from the fully connected layers of the ResNet-50 model.
4. Comparing the training time of the ResNet-50 model with other models and post-processing steps.

However, the text does not provide information on other important steps such as model serialization, platform selection, and deployment in a production environment. Therefore, we cannot provide a complete answer to the query based on the provided context.
