Answer:::

In the context provided, the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. However, it is clear that the deep learning method used is semantic segmentation, as mentioned in the keywords and the reference to the U-net architecture. Semantic segmentation is a pixel-wise classification approach, where each pixel in an image is classified into a specific class.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines can include:

1. Image-level annotation: In this technique, a single label is assigned to an entire image. This is the simplest form of annotation and is useful when the goal is to classify an image into one of several categories.

2. Bounding box annotation: Here, a bounding box is drawn around an object of interest in an image. This technique is useful when the goal is to locate objects within an image.

3. Instance segmentation: This is a more advanced form of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and labeled separately, even if the objects are of the same class. This technique is useful when the goal is to count or track individual objects within an image.

4. Landmark annotation: In this technique, specific points or landmarks are identified on an object within an image. This technique is useful when the goal is to analyze the shape or orientation of an object.

In the context of the study mentioned, it can be inferred that the data annotation technique used is semantic segmentation, as they mention the use of the U-net architecture, which is a deep learning method specifically designed for semantic segmentation. They used this method to segment individual tree species in high-resolution imagery of tropical forests, achieving human-level classification accuracy over large areas. However, the specific method used for annotating the data is not mentioned.
