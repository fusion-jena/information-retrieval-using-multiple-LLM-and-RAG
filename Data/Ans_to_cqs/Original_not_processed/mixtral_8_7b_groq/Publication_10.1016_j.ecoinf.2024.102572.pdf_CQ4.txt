Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The text discusses the use of Sentinel-2 satellite images and a global forest biomass dataset with a resolution of 100m in a study related to forest fires. It explains how the resolution of the forest biomass dataset is scaled down to 500m using the "ee.reduceResolution()" function and the "ee.Reducer.mean()" reducer on Google Earth Engine (GEE). However, it does not mention any data augmentation techniques.

Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size of the training set, improve model performance, and reduce overfitting. These techniques create modified versions of the original images by applying transformations such as horizontal or vertical flipping, rotating by a certain angle, or scaling up or down.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide specific details about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
