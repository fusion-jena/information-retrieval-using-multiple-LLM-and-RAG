The provided context does not directly discuss the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide information about the data sources and preprocessing methods used in a specific study related to carbon emission estimation.

In this study, the data sources include nighttime lighting data, provincial and municipal statistical energy data, and carbon emission factors for various energy sources. To ensure data quality, the nighttime lighting data underwent specific preprocessing steps, such as converting the coordinate system to Lambert's equal-area projection coordinate system and extracting images of the target area using the ArcGIS Mask Extraction Tool.

While these steps do not directly address data bias, they can be seen as part of a broader data preprocessing strategy that includes data quality control and ensuring the appropriate representation of the target area.

As for addressing data bias specifically, some common techniques used in the preprocessing of deep learning pipelines include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the data into subgroups based on specific criteria (e.g., class labels) and then ensuring that each subset is represented proportionally in the training, validation, and testing sets. This can help reduce bias that might arise from an imbalanced dataset.
2. Oversampling and undersampling: Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances from underrepresented classes, while undersampling reduces the number of instances from overrepresented classes. These techniques can help balance the dataset and reduce bias.
3. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources, domains, or demographic groups can help ensure that the dataset is representative and less prone to bias.

While these techniques are not mentioned in the provided context, they are essential considerations when working with biased datasets in deep learning.
