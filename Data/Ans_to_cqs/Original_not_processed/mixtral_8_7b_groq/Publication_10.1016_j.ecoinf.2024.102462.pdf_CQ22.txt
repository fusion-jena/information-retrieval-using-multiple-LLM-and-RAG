Answer:::

The pieces of context provided do not give specific information about the metrics used to evaluate the deep learning models, other than mentioning that they are used to evaluate the results of the whole study. However, they do give some insight into the types of metrics that are commonly reported in similar studies.

In the field of ecological image classification, it is common to report high classification accuracy values for deep learning models. For example, Cabezas et al. (2020) reported a classification accuracy of 98.10% for a ResNet50 network when detecting an invasive blueberry species, and Shirai et al. (2020; 2022) reported accuracy values of 77% and 97.80% for detecting the flower petals of an endangered species.

Additionally, the context highlights the importance of considering class-wise metrics, such as FPR (False Positive Rate) values for larger classes, in order to provide a more complete picture of the model's performance.

Therefore, while the specific metrics used to evaluate the deep learning models in the study are not mentioned, it can be inferred that metrics such as classification accuracy, precision, recall, and class-wise metrics like FPR are likely to have been used.
