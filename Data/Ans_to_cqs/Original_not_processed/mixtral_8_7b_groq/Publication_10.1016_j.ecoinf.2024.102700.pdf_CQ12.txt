Based on the provided context, the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. It is only stated that there was a limited use of deep learning strategies, such as neural networks (Cazau et al., 2023), in the studies examined. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific type of deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
