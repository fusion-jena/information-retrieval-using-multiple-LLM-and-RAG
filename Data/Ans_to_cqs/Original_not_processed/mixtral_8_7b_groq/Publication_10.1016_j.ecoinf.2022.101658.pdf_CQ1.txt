Answer:

The methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline in the study conducted by Cameron et al. (2022) include field measurements and ground photographs. Specifically, the researchers collected data at three field sites: Pelican Mountain (PM), Calling Lake (CL), and Conklin (CK). At PM and CL, they manually classified fuel types and estimated overstory composition for up to two species. They also calculated fuel load for each fuel weight diameter (FWD) size class using a specific formula. At the Conklin site, they used the data solely for independent validation.

In addition, the researchers collected ground photographs, which were used for training and testing the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) semantic segmentation algorithm. The ground photographs were taken at a nadir angle, which means they were taken directly overhead. The exposure settings of these photographs could potentially be used to standardize images and enable distributed data collection of nadir photographs by groups of personnel working at different times of the day and using different brands of smartphones.

It is important to note that the study did not use any public datasets or sensors for collecting raw data. Instead, they relied on their own field measurements and ground photographs. However, they suggested that future work could explore techniques such as active learning and pre-training on new semantically related datasets.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline in the study conducted by Cameron et al. (2022) include field measurements and ground photographs taken at a nadir angle. These methods were used to collect data at three field sites, which were then used for training and testing the DCNN semantic segmentation algorithm.
