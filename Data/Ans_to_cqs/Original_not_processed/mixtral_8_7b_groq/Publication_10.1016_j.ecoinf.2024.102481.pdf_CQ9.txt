Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The data availability statement only mentions that the data used in the study is confidential and not publicly available. There is no mention of any data repository where the deep learning pipeline or related data might be available, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
