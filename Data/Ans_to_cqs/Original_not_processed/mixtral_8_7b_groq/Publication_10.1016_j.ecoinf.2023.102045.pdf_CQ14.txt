Based on the provided articles, there is no direct information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized in the rasterdiv package. However, some of the articles discuss methods for optimizing visualization parameters that could be applied to model optimization.

Rogowitz et al. (1996) discuss the importance of avoiding misleading visualizations in scientific communication. They emphasize the need for careful consideration of color ramps, among other visualization choices, to ensure accurate representation of data. Similarly, Stoelzle and Stein (2021) discuss the distortions caused by the use of rainbow color maps in hydrology and provide guidance for better visualizations and science communication.

In the context of color ramps, the rasterdiv package provides options for color ramps tailored to different types of color blindness. Specifically, it uses the magma color ramp palette for tritanopia, which is a form of color blindness that affects the perception of blue and yellow (Spalding, 1999). This consideration of color blindness in the design of the package suggests a thoughtful approach to visualization and communication of results.

While these articles do not directly discuss model hyperparameter optimization, they do emphasize the importance of careful consideration of visualization parameters and the need for clear and accurate communication of scientific results. It is possible that the developers of the rasterdiv package used similar methods for optimizing model hyperparameters, such as grid search or random search, but this information is not provided in the articles.
