Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline primarily uses image data formats in processing and analyzing wildlife camera trap data. This is evident as the researchers focused on reviewing and analyzing images obtained from camera traps, which were then used to train machine learning models for automating tasks such as detecting and classifying wildlife in the images.

The context also mentions that image metadata, including motion detection or time-lapse information, were extracted and assigned to each image in the dataset. This suggests that image metadata might also be used as additional data formats in the deep learning pipeline.

However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the deep learning pipeline. While video data could be implicitly included in the image data format, as images are typically extracted from video streams, the context does not specifically refer to video data. Similarly, there is no mention of audio or CSV data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in the context provided primarily uses image data formats, with potential additional use of image metadata. There is no explicit mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in this pipeline.
