Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The text mentions several sources that were used or consulted in the course of the research, such as the ResNet-34 architecture, the fast.ai framework, and datasets like ImageNet. However, it does not specify that any of these sources were used as a data repository for the deep learning pipeline in question.

The context also mentions that the researchers tripled the image pool for each transect by incorporating multi-temporal data, but it does not give a location where this data can be accessed.

In summary, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
