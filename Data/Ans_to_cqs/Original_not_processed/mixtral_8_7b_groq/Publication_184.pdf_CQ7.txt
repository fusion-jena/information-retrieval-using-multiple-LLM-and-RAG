Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the data was split for training, testing, and validation of the deep learning model. However, we can make some educated guesses based on common practices in deep learning.

In deep learning, it's common to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

Given that the context focuses on the training process and the hyperparameters used for training, it's likely that the data was split in a way that prioritized having a large training set. Specifically, the context mentions that "for each epoch, 64 images are randomly selected and used to train the model" and that "a total of 4000 iterations were run." This suggests that the data was split in such a way that a sufficient number of images were available for training over 4000 iterations.

However, the context does not mention anything about a validation or testing set. This could mean that either the data was not split into these sets, or that the information about the split was not included in the context.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information about how the data was split for training, validation, and testing, it's likely that the data was split in a way that prioritized having a large training set. However, without further information, it's impossible to say for sure.
