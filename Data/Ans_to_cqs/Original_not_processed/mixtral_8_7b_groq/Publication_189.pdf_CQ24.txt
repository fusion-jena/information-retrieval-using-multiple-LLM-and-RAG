Answer:::

In the context provided, there are a few strategies mentioned or implied for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Firstly, the use of a fixed random seed value is suggested. In the implementation details of Mask R-CNN, it is mentioned that the system was implemented on a machine with 1 GPU, and the batch size for mrcnn training is taken as a product of GPU and Images per GPU. However, the specific random seed value used is not provided. Using a fixed random seed value ensures reproducibility of results by controlling the randomness in various processes such as weight initialization, data shuffling, and dropout.

Secondly, the use of data augmentation is mentioned as a strategy to improve the performance of a fine-tuned CNN model. Data augmentation involves creating new training samples by applying random transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping to the existing data. This can help in reducing overfitting and increasing the robustness of the model by introducing randomness in the training data.

Thirdly, the use of learning rate decay is mentioned as a strategy to improve the training of Mask R-CNN. Learning rate decay involves gradually reducing the learning rate during training to prevent the model from converging too quickly to a suboptimal solution. This can help in fine-tuning the model and improving its generalization performance.

Lastly, the use of cross-validation is implied as a strategy to evaluate the performance of Mask R-CNN. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on one fold, and testing it on the remaining folds. This can help in reducing the variance in the performance estimates and providing a more reliable evaluation of the model.

In summary, the strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline include using a fixed random seed value, data augmentation, learning rate decay, and cross-validation. These strategies can help in improving the reproducibility, robustness, and generalization performance of deep learning models.
