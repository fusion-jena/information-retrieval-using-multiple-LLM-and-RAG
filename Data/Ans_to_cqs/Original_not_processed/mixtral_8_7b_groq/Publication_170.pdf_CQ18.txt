Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves evaluating the model's errors and time costs at each training phase. A fixed iteration termination condition is used for the model in each round of training, which is when the loss rate of the model is less than a predetermined threshold (ɛ = 1.0 × 10-4). The performance of the models is evaluated using the same test set (Test) across all training phases.

Three error metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance: overall error, commission error, and omission error. The overall error is the sum of the commission and omission errors. The commission error is the ratio of false positives (FP) to the sum of true positives (TP) and false positives (FP). The omission error is the ratio of false negatives (FN) to the sum of true positives (TP) and false negatives (FN).

To study the performance of the model on each training set using different training modes and computing platforms, three experiments were conducted. The first experiment used zero-start training mode on a GPU server with the datasets Train1 to Train7. The second experiment used incremental training mode on a GPU server with the same datasets. The third experiment used incremental training mode on a desktop PC with the same datasets.

Two computing platforms were used in the study: a Lenovo desktop computer with Intel Core i7-7700 and a GPU server with two Intel Xeon E5-2600 v4 processors, 256 GB RAM, and two NVIDIA Tesla K80 with 24 GB GDDR5 Graphics Card. A desktop PC with a NVIDIA GeForce GT 730 with 2 GB GDDR5 Graphics Card was also used.

The models' error values were compared using a proportion test, and error values that did not share a letter code were significantly different (p < 0.05). Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the error values for the models trained using different training modes and computing platforms.

Therefore, the strategy to monitor the model performance during training involves evaluating the model's errors and time costs at each training phase using a fixed iteration termination condition and the same test set. The model's performance is evaluated using three error metrics, and the experiments are conducted using different training modes and computing platforms.
