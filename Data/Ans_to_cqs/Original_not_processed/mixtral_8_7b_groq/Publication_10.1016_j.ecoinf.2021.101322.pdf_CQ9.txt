Based on the information provided, the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly stated to be hosted on a specific platform such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, there are two salmon scale image datasets mentioned in the context:

1. Salmon scale 9056 image dataset: doi:10.21335/NMDC-1050865887
2. Extra image dataset for expert reading: 335/NMDC-1462728994, doi:10.21

These datasets are accessible through their respective DOIs, which suggests that they are available in a digital repository. The first dataset is specifically used for training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in the study.

Additionally, the CNN architecture used in the study is based on EfficientNet, and the pre-trained network weights (EfficientNet-B4) are available in the project's GitHub repository: <https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet/blob/master/efficientnet/weights.py>.

In summary, while the specific data repository platform is not specified, there are two salmon scale image datasets available through their DOIs, and the pre-trained CNN weights are available on GitHub.
