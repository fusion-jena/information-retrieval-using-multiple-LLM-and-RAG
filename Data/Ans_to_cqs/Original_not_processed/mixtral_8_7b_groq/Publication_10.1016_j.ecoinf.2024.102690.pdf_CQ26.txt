The provided context does not directly discuss data bias techniques used during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) neural network approach for identifying ecological sources. While this does not answer the query directly, it is worth noting that data bias can be addressed in various ways during the preprocessing phase, including stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling is a technique that ensures each subset of the data contains a representative proportion of the various classes. This method can help prevent data bias by ensuring that each class is adequately represented in the training, validation, and test datasets.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance the class distribution in the dataset. Oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class, while undersampling involves removing samples from the majority class. These techniques can help reduce data bias by ensuring that the model is exposed to a balanced set of examples from each class during training.

Diverse data collection is another strategy for addressing data bias. By collecting data from various sources, one can ensure that the dataset is representative of the real-world scenarios and reduces the risk of overfitting to a specific subset of the data.

In summary, while the provided context does not discuss specific data bias techniques used during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, it is important to note that techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be employed to address data bias during the preprocessing phase.
