Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The text focuses on the process of deriving and analyzing the kNDVI (kernel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) trends and their relationship with various environmental factors.

However, we can infer that some postprocessing steps might have been taken in the data analysis and statistical testing stages. For instance, the kNDVI trends were categorized based on the slope and p-value (P) obtained from a linear regression analysis. The p-value significance level was set at 0.05, and four types of kNDVI trends were defined according to the slope and p-value (Table 3).

Moreover, correlation analysis was performed between kNDVI and various environmental factors (Climate, Terrain, Human activity, Evaporation, Sunshine duration, Relative Humidity, Precipitation, Temperature, Elevation, Slope, Aspect, Geomorphological type, Nighttime light, Population density, Road distance) to understand the relationship between vegetation health and these factors (Fig. 8).

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention common postprocessing steps like Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix, it does mention statistical testing and correlation analysis as part of the data analysis process.
