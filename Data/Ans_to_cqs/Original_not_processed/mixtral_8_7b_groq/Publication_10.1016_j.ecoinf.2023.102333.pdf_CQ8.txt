Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the code repository for the deep learning pipeline was not provided in the given context. The context includes several research papers and studies related to the application of deep learning in remote sensing, specifically for land-use and land-cover (LCLU) classification. However, none of them mention or provide a link to the code repository.

The studies discuss various aspects of deep learning for remote sensing, such as the optimization of deep neural network (DNN) models, the use of spectral indices, and the application of multi-task spatiotemporal deep learning for large-scale rice mapping. They also mention the use of Google Earth Engine for processing remote sensing data. However, they do not provide any information about the code repository.

Therefore, I am unable to provide the location of the code repository based on the given context. I recommend contacting the authors of the relevant studies directly to inquire about the availability of the code.
