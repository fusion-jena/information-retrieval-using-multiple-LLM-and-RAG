The provided context does not include information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on a study that uses a stepwise variable selection procedure and linear discriminant analysis for species and sex discrimination. It mentions the use of F-ratios and a p-value threshold for variable selection, as well as the generation of uncertainty bands and probability values for classification. However, it does not provide any details about optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or any other optimizers used in deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the given context.
