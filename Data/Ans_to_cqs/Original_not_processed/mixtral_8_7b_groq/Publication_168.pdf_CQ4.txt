Answer:

The provided context does not give specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for Hyperspectral Image (HSI) classification. However, it is common practice to use data augmentation techniques to increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's performance in deep learning. Some of the commonly used data augmentation techniques are flipping, rotating, and scaling.

Flipping is a technique where the image is flipped horizontally or vertically to create a new image. This technique helps the model to learn features that are invariant to the direction of the image.

Rotating is a technique where the image is rotated by a certain angle to create a new image. This technique helps the model to learn features that are invariant to the orientation of the image.

Scaling is a technique where the image is scaled up or down to create a new image. This technique helps the model to learn features that are invariant to the size of the image.

In the context of HSI classification, data augmentation techniques can be used to increase the size of the training dataset, which is often limited. The augmented data can help the deep learning model to learn more robust features and improve its performance.

For instance, in the paper by Hu et al. [4], they designed a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1-D-CNN) for HSI classification. However, the paper does not mention any data augmentation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. Similarly, in the paper by Zhang et al. [5], they proposed a DCNN including spectral and spatial two channels for HSI classification. Again, the paper does not mention any data augmentation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, while data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning, the provided context does not give specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for HSI classification.
