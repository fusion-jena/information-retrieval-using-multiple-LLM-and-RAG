The provided context does not contain information about deep learning pipelines or data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The texts focus on topics related to climate and ecology, particularly in the Mediterranean region.

Here is a brief overview of data annotation techniques in deep learning:

Data annotation is an essential step in the development of deep learning models, especially for computer vision tasks. It involves labeling or annotating data, such as images, to help the model understand and learn from the information. Some common data annotation techniques include:

1. Image classification: Assigning a single label to an entire image, indicating the primary object or scene within the image.
2. Bounding box annotation: Drawing a box around the object of interest in an image, providing the model with the object's location and size.
3. Semantic segmentation: Labeling each pixel in an image according to the object or class it belongs to, creating a pixel-wise classification of the image.
4. Instance segmentation: A combination of bounding box annotation and semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is individually segmented and labeled within an image.
5. Landmark annotation: Identifying and marking key points or landmarks on an object within an image, useful for tasks like facial recognition or pose estimation.

These techniques enable deep learning models to better understand and process visual data, improving their performance in tasks like object detection, image recognition, and segmentation.
