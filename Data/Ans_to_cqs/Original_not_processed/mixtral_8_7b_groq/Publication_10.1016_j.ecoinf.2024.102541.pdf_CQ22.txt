The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including Average Precision (AP), mean Average Precision (mAP), and frames per second (FPS). 

Average Precision (AP) is a metric used to evaluate the accuracy of an object detection model. It is calculated as the area under the precision-recall curve. A higher AP value indicates improved accuracy across various object classes. Specifically, AP0.5:0.95 represents the AP calculated over an IoU (Intersection over Union) range from 0.5 to 0.95 in increments of 0.05, while AP0.5 refers to the AP at a 50% IoU threshold.

Mean Average Precision (mAP) is defined as the mean of all AP values. It provides an overall assessment of the model's accuracy across all object classes.

In addition to accuracy metrics, the model's computational efficiency is also evaluated using FPS (frames per second). FPS measures the model's speed, encompassing pre-processing, inference, and non-maximum suppression speeds. A higher FPS value indicates that the model can process more frames per second, which is critical for real-time applications.

The provided context also mentions the use of the precision metric in Fig. 19, which compares the precision of the baseline model and the proposed model for the Wild Animal Facing Extinction dataset (WAD), Fishmarket dataset, and MS COCO 2017 dataset. Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.

Therefore, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using a combination of accuracy metrics, such as AP and mAP, and speed metrics, such as FPS. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, taking into account both its accuracy and computational efficiency.
