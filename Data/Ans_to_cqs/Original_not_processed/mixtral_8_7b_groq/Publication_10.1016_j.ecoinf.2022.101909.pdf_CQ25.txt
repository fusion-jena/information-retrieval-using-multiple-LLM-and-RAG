Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification, specifically for the identification of bird species using their calls or songs. The model is built on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is a type of artificial neural network that has shown excellent performance in object recognition tasks, including image and audio data (LeCun and Bengio, 1995; Krizhevsky et al., 2012; LeCun et al., 2015).

In the study by Bravo et al. (2017), the authors focused on the migratory behavior of the White-crested Elaenia (Elaenia albiceps chilensis), an essential seed disperser for Patagonian forest regeneration. However, they did not mention using a deep learning model for species identification. Instead, they used direct observations and banding to study the bird's migration patterns.

In contrast, recent studies have applied deep learning techniques to automatically identify bird species from audio recordings (Lasseck, 2019; LeBien et al., 2020; Borowiec et al., 2021; Zhong et al., 2021). For instance, LeBien et al. (2020) developed a pipeline for identifying bird and frog species in tropical soundscape recordings using a CNN. Similarly, Borowiec et al. (2021) and Zhong et al. (2021) used deep learning models for bird species classification in soundscape recordings.

The deep learning model's goal in these studies is to classify the bird calls or songs accurately, enabling large-scale, automated monitoring of bird diversity and acoustic activity. This is particularly important in the context of climate emergency and biodiversity loss (Butt et al., 2021; Sueur et al., 2019; Tittensor et al., 2019). Moreover, the model can potentially be used to examine abiotic oscillations and their relationship with the annual dynamics of bird calls, contributing to the field of acoustic phenology (Luther, 2009).

In summary, the purpose of the deep learning model in this context is bird species classification using audio recordings. This allows for large-scale, automated monitoring of bird diversity and acoustic activity, contributing to the understanding of bird ecology and the impacts of climate change on avian communities.
