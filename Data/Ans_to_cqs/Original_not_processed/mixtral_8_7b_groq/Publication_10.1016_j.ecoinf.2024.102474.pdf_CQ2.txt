Answer:::

The provided context does not give a detailed description of the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of "datacubes" in the EarthNet2021 Challenge, which consists of training data for a video prediction task. Datacubes are a 3D extension of matrices, where the third dimension represents a feature or variable. In the context of EarthNet2021, these datacubes likely contain multidimensional climate and vegetation data.

Additionally, the context references the use of Transformer-based architectures for video prediction tasks. This implies the use of video data, which typically consists of a series of frames (images) stored in a suitable format, such as MP4 or AVI.

In summary, the EarthNet2021 Challenge utilizes datacubes, which are a form of multidimensional data, and video data for their deep learning pipeline. However, the context does not explicitly mention other data formats like audio or CSV files.
