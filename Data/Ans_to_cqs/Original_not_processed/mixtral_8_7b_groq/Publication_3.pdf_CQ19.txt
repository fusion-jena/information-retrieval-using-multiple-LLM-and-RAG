Answer:::
The deep learning model was built using TensorFlow, as mentioned in the context. No other frameworks like PyTorch were mentioned to have been used in the construction of the model.

TensorFlow is a popular open-source framework for building and deploying machine learning models. It was developed by the Google Brain team and is used for a wide range of applications, from image and speech recognition to natural language processing and drug discovery. TensorFlow provides a flexible platform for defining and running computations using data flow graphs, which enables efficient deployment of models on various hardware platforms.

In the provided context, TensorFlow was used to build a deep learning model for species identification using animal acoustic signals. The model architecture is based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are a subset of deep neural networks (DNNs) specialized for image classification tasks and pattern recognition. CNNs are built on three types of layers: convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Convolutional layers apply hierarchical feature extraction and decomposition of input images, pooling layers reduce the number of parameters and necessary computation, and fully connected layers perform the actual classification at the end of the pipeline.

The authors of the study used TensorFlow to train the CNN model for species identification, considering two factors to find the optimum number of training steps: correct identification rate and processing time. They calibrated models for classification challenges using different numbers of training steps and found that for all challenges except Challenge 3, 4000 training steps were the optimum number. For Challenge 3, which involved 41 species, 8000 training steps proved to be the optimum number.

The study also mentions future development plans for the model, including application to additional taxonomic groups (e.g., insects, birds) and automation of call detection from environmental sound samples as a precursor step to automated species identification. These future developments will likely also be built using TensorFlow.
