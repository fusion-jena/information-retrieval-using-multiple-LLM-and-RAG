Answer:::

The text provided does not give specific details about the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model used is DeepLabV3+, which was trained on the COCO dataset. The model was obtained from a pre-existing implementation on GitHub (<https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf>).

To use the model for their specific task, the authors performed semantic segmentation on landscape photos without training the model directly on these photos. Instead, they inferred the model on the landscape photos to obtain masks of the objects in the images.

The text does not mention any steps taken for model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a complete answer to the query based on the information given.
