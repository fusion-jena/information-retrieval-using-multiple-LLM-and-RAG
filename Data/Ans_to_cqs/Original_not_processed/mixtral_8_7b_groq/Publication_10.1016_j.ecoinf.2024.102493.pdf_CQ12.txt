Based on the provided context, the specific type of deep learning model used in the research pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. The context discusses various topics related to the analysis of vegetation health using kNDVI (kernel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and its trends, as well as the classification of vegetation conditions and influencing factors. However, it does not specify the type of deep learning model used.

There are several deep learning models that could be used for time series analysis and prediction, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In the context, there is a reference to a study by Guo et al. (2023b) that uses an LSTM time series NDVI prediction method incorporating climate elements. However, this does not necessarily mean that the same deep learning model is used in the primary research pipeline in question.

In summary, the provided context does not contain sufficient information to determine the specific type of deep learning model used in the research pipeline.
