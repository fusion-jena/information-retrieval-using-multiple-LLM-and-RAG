Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the specific deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) used to build the model. The text discusses the use of the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM), an unsupervised learning neural network approach, for identifying ecological sources and setting scenarios. However, it does not mention any particular deep learning framework for model development.
