The provided context discusses the use of CART (Classification and Regression Tree) model, which is a type of decision tree algorithm, and not a deep learning model. However, I will provide an answer based on the information given, assuming the question is about deploying a decision tree model.

Answer:
The context does not provide specific details about model serialization or platform selection for deploying the trained CART model. However, it does mention that the model was built using the Python programming language and the 'sklearn' library.

In general, to deploy a machine learning model, one would follow these steps:

1. Model serialization: This involves saving the trained model to a file, allowing it to be loaded and used later without having to retrain the model. In Python and 'sklearn', this can be done using the `joblib` or `pickle` libraries to save the model object to a file.

2. Platform selection: Once the model is serialized, it can be deployed on a platform suitable for the application. This could be a local machine, a server, or a cloud platform. The choice of platform depends on factors such as the required computational resources, the need for scalability, and the intended method of access (e.g., web API, desktop application).

3. Integration with other components: The deployed model will typically be integrated with other components, such as a user interface, data storage, or other processing modules. This may involve using web frameworks, databases, or other tools and libraries.

Based on the information provided, the CART model was built using Python and 'sklearn', and the model parameters were fine-tuned to prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation error. However, specific details about model serialization and platform selection are not provided.
