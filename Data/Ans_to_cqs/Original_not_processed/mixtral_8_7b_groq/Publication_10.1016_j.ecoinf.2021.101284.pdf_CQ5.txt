Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. The text discusses the use of a deep learning algorithm for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 patients based on X-ray and computed tomography images. However, it does not specify the dataset used.

The context does mention several papers and studies, but these papers use their own datasets, and they are not specified in the text. For example, Castillo (2020) used X-ray and computed tomography images for the early diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, but the source of these images is not provided. Similarly, Dong et al. (2021) studied the association between short-term exposure to air pollution and respiratory hospital admissions in Lanzhou, China, but the dataset used in this study is not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
