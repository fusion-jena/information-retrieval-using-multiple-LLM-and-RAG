Based on the provided context, there is no information about the deployment of a deep learning model. The context focuses on the analysis of the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model's output for Quercus pubescens Willd. and Quercus ilex subsp. ilex, using a subsample run type with a 30% random test percentage. The analysis involves the relative contributions of environmental and territorial variables to the MaxEnt model, determined through jackknife and permutation importance methods.

However, I can provide you with a general process for deploying a trained deep learning model:

Answer:::
The process for deploying a trained deep learning model typically involves several steps:

1. Model Serialization: Once the deep learning model has been trained and validated, it is essential to serialize the model. Serialization is the process of converting the model into a format that can be stored and loaded again. Common serialization formats include JSON, XML, or using specific libraries like `joblib` or `pickle` in Python.

2. Platform Selection: Choose a platform for deploying the model, depending on the use case. Popular platforms include cloud services like AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud AI Platform, or Microsoft Azure Machine Learning. Alternatively, you can deploy the model on-premises if required.

3. Model Conversion: Depending on the platform, you might need to convert the serialized model into a format compatible with the target platform. For example, you may need to convert a TensorFlow model into a TensorFlow.js format for web deployment or a TensorFlow Serving format for gRPC or REST API deployment.

4. Serving the Model: Load the serialized model onto the chosen platform and serve it through an API or another method, depending on the platform's capabilities. This allows other applications to make predictions using the deployed model.

5. Monitoring and Maintenance: After deployment, it is crucial to monitor the model's performance and maintain it by retraining, updating, or replacing it as needed.
