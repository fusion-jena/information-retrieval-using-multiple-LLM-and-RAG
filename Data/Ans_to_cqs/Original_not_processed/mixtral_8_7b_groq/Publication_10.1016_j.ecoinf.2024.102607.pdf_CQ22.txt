Answer:::

The provided context discusses various methods and techniques used for land use and land cover (LULC) mapping, including the use of different sampling strategies, tile models, and multiple probabilistic classification modes. However, it does not specifically mention the use of a deep learning model for LULC mapping. Therefore, I will provide a general answer regarding the metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models.

Deep learning models for LULC mapping or other remote sensing tasks are typically evaluated using several metrics, including:

1. Accuracy: This is the ratio of the correctly classified samples to the total number of samples. It provides an overall measure of the model's performance.

Accuracy = (True Positives + True Negatives) / Total Samples

2. Producer's Accuracy (PA): This metric measures the proportion of actual samples in a given class that are correctly classified by the model.

PA = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)

3. User's Accuracy (UA): This metric measures the proportion of predicted samples in a given class that are actually of that class.

UA = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)

4. Kappa Coefficient: This metric measures the agreement between the predicted and actual class labels, taking into account the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance.

Kappa = (Observed Accuracy - Expected Accuracy) / (1 - Expected Accuracy)

5. F1 Score: This metric is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the two.

F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)

6. Precision: This metric measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions made by the model.

Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)

7. Recall: This metric measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive samples.

Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)

These metrics help assess the performance of deep learning models for LULC mapping or other remote sensing tasks, providing insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the models. The choice of metrics depends on the specific requirements and goals of the project.
