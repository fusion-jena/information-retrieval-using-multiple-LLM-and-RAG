Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning methods for understanding rural landscapes and the aspects considered in the construction of the dataset, but it does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the indicators used in the dataset, we can infer that the raw data was likely collected using a combination of surveys, sensors, and public datasets.

The "Economy" aspect of the dataset uses Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as an indicator, which is typically collected through surveys and economic censuses conducted by government agencies. The "Society" aspect of the dataset uses Nighttime Light (NTL) as an indicator, which is collected through satellite-mounted sensors that measure the amount of artificial light produced by human activities. The "Ecology" aspect of the dataset uses Net Primary Productivity (NPP) as an indicator, which is collected through satellite-based remote sensing technologies that measure the amount of energy captured by vegetation during photosynthesis.

Additionally, the context cites a study by Moortgat et al. (2022) that used multispectral and panchromatic commercial satellite imagery for river classification, indicating the use of satellite-based sensors for data collection. The study by Nicholls et al. (2020) on deltas in the Anthropocene and the study by Nogueira (2019) on sustainable development also suggest the use of public datasets for data collection.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline was collected using a combination of surveys, sensors, and public datasets. Surveys and censuses were likely used for collecting economic data, satellite-mounted sensors were used for collecting society and ecology data, and public datasets were used for collecting data on various aspects of rural landscapes.
