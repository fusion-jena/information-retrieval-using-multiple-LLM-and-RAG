Based on the provided context, there is no information indicating that any specific type of deep learning model, such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer, is used in the pipeline. The text focuses on the development of an ensemble model for species distribution of orchids in New Guinea, taking into account climate change and land cover changes.

The tasks mentioned in the context include data curation, investigation, validation, supervision, resources, project administration, visualization, software, methodology, formal analysis, and conceptualization. While these tasks are crucial in the development and implementation of a machine learning model, they do not specify the type of deep learning model used.

An ensemble model typically combines multiple models to improve overall performance. However, the specific deep learning models used in the ensemble are not mentioned in the context. Therefore, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer to this query without additional information.
