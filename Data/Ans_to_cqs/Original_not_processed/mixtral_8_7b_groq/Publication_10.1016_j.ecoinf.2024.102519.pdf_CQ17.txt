Answer:::

The provided context does not directly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of artificial neural networks and support vector machines (SVM) in various research applications. Regularization is a common technique used in these models to prevent overfitting.

In deep learning, dropout and L2 regularization are two commonly used methods to prevent overfitting.

Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the network more robust and less prone to overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2014). By dropping out neurons, the network is forced to learn more robust features that are useful in conjunction with many different random subsets of the other neurons.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a method that adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the sum of the squares of all the model's weights (Goodfellow et al., 2016). This penalty term discourages the learning of large weights, which can lead to overfitting. By adding this penalty, the model is forced to distribute the weights more evenly, leading to a simpler and more generalized model.

In the context of the research on artificial intelligence, it is likely that these or similar regularization methods were used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning models. However, the specific regularization methods used are not mentioned in the provided context.

Another technique to prevent overfitting is early stopping. This technique consists of stopping the training process before the model starts to overfit. This can be done by monitoring the performance of the model on a validation set during the training process and stopping the training when the performance on the validation set starts to degrade.
