Answer:::

The specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the deep learning models used a learning rate of 0.008 with a cosine learning rate decay. This suggests that some form of learning rate scheduling was applied during training.

In general, there are several optimization techniques that can be used in deep learning pipelines, including Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad. SGD is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters by taking a step in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad are adaptive optimization algorithms that adjust the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradient information.

Given that the deep learning models used Tensorflow2, it is likely that one of the built-in optimization algorithms in Tensorflow2 was used. According to the Tensorflow2 documentation, the default optimizer is Adam with a learning rate of 0.001. However, the context mentions a learning rate of 0.008, so it is possible that a different optimizer or learning rate was used.

In summary, while the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is likely that one of the built-in optimization algorithms in Tensorflow2 was used, such as Adam or SGD, with a learning rate of 0.008 and cosine learning rate decay.
