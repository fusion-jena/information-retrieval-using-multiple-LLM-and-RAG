The context provided does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is common practice in deep learning to use data augmentation techniques to increase the size and diversity of the training set and improve model performance. These techniques include flipping, rotating, and scaling images.

Flipping involves creating new training examples by horizontally or vertically flipping the original images. This helps the model learn to recognize objects regardless of their orientation.

Rotating involves creating new training examples by rotating the original images by a certain angle. This helps the model learn to recognize objects in different orientations and positions.

Scaling involves creating new training examples by resizing the original images. This helps the model learn to recognize objects at different scales.

Therefore, it is possible that these data augmentation techniques were applied in the deep learning pipeline used in the study described in the context. However, this information is not explicitly stated in the context.
