Answer:::

The provided context discusses the training of a machine learning model, specifically a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest (RF), but it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps applied before training the model. However, it can be inferred that some data preprocessing steps were taken into account.

Firstly, in the context of the RF model, it is mentioned that ML algorithms were exploited to compensate for missing values in the dataset. This implies that handling missing data, a common preprocessing step, was performed before training the model.

Secondly, the RF model's hyperparameters were tested using a grid configuration that includes the "number of features to consider at every split (max features)" set to "auto". This option typically refers to data scaling techniques, where the model automatically determines the best way to scale the features based on the data distribution.

Lastly, the MLP model's activation function, Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), is applied to the weighted sum of input variables. This activation function is often used after data normalization, where input variables are scaled between a specific range, typically 0 and 1, to improve model performance.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, data scaling, and normalization were likely involved before training the deep learning model. However, it is important to note that the context does not explicitly mention these preprocessing steps.
