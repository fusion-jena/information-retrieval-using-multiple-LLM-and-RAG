Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention that a 50% probability of occurrence was used during training, and that the model was selected based on validation set performance. These practices could be related to handling randomness, as they involve a degree of stochasticity in the training process.

In general, there are several strategies that can be used to handle randomness in deep learning. One common approach is to set a fixed random seed value, which ensures that the same sequence of random numbers is generated each time the model is trained. This can help to ensure reproducibility of results, as the same data augmentations and weight initializations will be used in each training run.

Another strategy for handling randomness is to use techniques such as dropout and batch normalization, which introduce a degree of randomness during training but have been shown to improve model generalization. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of the neurons in a layer to zero during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing co-adaptation of feature detectors. Batch normalization normalizes the inputs to each layer, which can help to improve model convergence and reduce the impact of initialization.

Finally, it is also important to consider randomness in the evaluation of deep learning models. This can be done by using techniques such as cross-validation, where the model is trained and evaluated on multiple different subsets of the data. This can help to ensure that the model is not overfitting to a particular subset of the data, and can provide a more robust estimate of model performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about strategies for handling randomness in deep learning, there are several common approaches that can be used. These include setting a fixed random seed value, using techniques such as dropout and batch normalization, and evaluating the model using cross-validation.
