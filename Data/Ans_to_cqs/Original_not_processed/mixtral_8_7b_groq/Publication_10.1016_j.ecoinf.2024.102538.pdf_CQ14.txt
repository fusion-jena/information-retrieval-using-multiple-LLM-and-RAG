Answer:::
The context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. There is no mention of methods such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization techniques. The text does describe the specific values used for the learning rate, weight decay, batch size, and other hyperparameters. However, it does not explain how these values were determined. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the provided context.
