Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated which specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that suggest certain techniques may have been used.

Firstly, the importance of using a diverse dataset is emphasized in the context. The authors mention the need to curate less biased representations of a species' niche while also accounting for biases that plague biodiversity datasets. This implies that the dataset used for training the deep learning model was likely curated to include a wide range of data points, reducing the risk of overfitting to specific biases.

Secondly, the authors discuss the challenges of using validation metrics for model-based integration, as biases and sampling methods can differ. This suggests that some form of cross-validation or stratified splitting may have been employed to ensure that the model's performance is not overly dependent on specific subsets of the data.

However, these are inferences based on the provided context, and there is no explicit mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting. Therefore, while it is likely that some measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the specific techniques used are not explicitly stated in the given text.
