Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework was used to build the model. The focus of the text is on the system structure, the use of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, and the input features for the model.

Commonly used deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. These frameworks provide the necessary tools and functions to design, train, and implement deep learning models. However, without specific information in the context, it is not possible to definitively say which of these or any other framework was used.
