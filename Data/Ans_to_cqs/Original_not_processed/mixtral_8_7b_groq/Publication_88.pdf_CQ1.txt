The provided context does not give specific information about how raw data is collected in the deep learning pipeline. It mainly focuses on the description of the datasets used, the architecture of the deep learning model (EF network), and the evaluation methods for the model's performance.

However, it can be inferred that the raw data used in this study comes from satellite imagery of two different regions, Amazon and Cerrado, and is likely obtained from remote sensing sensors. The data is divided into training, validation, and test sets, and the number of available samples for each set is presented in Tables 1 and 2.

Additionally, another method used in the study is the Support Vector Machine (SVM) filter bank. This method involves extracting mini-patches from input patches and vectorizing them to create a training set for SVMs. The SVMs filters are trained using a conventional forward supervised learning layer by layer in a greedy fashion. The raw data for this method is also likely obtained from satellite imagery.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state how raw data is collected, it can be inferred that the data comes from remote sensing satellite imagery of two different regions, Amazon and Cerrado.
