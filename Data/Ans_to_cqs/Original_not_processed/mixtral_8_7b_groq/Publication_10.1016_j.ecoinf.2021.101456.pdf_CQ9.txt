Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on explaining the concept of Variational Autoencodbers (VAEs) and their use in ecological informatics, specifically in the context of unlabelled field data and the creation of clusters for different species.

The authors describe the use of a VAE with a dynamic Î²-annealing technique, which improves the clustering of species in a two-dimensional feature space. They also mention the inclusion of 10% labeled data for training, which further enhances the results.

The architecture of the network is reported in Table 1, but the location of the data repository is not provided. Therefore, I cannot give a specific answer to the query.
