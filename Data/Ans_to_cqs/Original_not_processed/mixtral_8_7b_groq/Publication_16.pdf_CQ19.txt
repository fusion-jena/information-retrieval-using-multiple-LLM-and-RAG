Answer:::

The deep learning model is built using the Keras framework with TensorFlow 2.2 as the backend. The Librosa library is used for data pre-processing, and CUDA 11 and cuDNN 7.6.5 are utilized to enable GPU-accelerated learning. The model is hosted and served through a public-facing website developed by the authors. The system can interface with a variety of sensors for real-time inference, and where field communication is unavailable, audio files can be batch uploaded through the website for offline inferencing.
