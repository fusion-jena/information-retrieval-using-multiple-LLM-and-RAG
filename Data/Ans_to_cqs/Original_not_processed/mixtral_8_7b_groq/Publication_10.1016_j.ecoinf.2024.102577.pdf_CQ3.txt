The provided context does not contain specific information about data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does contain information about machine learning techniques used in the context of ecological informatics and sustainable fishing.

To answer the query, I will provide a general overview of some common data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Data annotation is the process of labeling data so that it can be used to train machine learning models. In the context of computer vision, data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This involves drawing a box around an object of interest in an image. The box contains the object and provides a way to identify it.
2. Instance segmentation: This is a more detailed form of annotation where the object of interest is not only enclosed in a box but also segmented from the background and other objects in the image. Each pixel in the image is labeled as belonging to the object or not.
3. Semantic segmentation: This is similar to instance segmentation, but instead of labeling individual objects, the image is divided into regions based on the type of object present.
4. Landmark annotation: This involves identifying specific points or landmarks on an object. For example, in the case of a fish, the landmarks might include the eyes, fins, and tail.
5. Keypoint annotation: This is similar to landmark annotation but involves identifying a set of key points that describe the object's shape or pose.

These data annotation techniques are used to train deep learning models for various applications such as object detection, image segmentation, and pose estimation.

In summary, data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, landmark annotation, and keypoint annotation. These techniques are used to label data so that it can be used to train machine learning models for various applications.
