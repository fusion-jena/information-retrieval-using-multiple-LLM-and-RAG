Answer:::

The specific deep learning frameworks used to build the model are not mentioned in the provided text. However, it is mentioned that deep learning models were used for the semi-automated survey of African wildlife using oblique imagery. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where artificial neural networks are trained to perform complex tasks through a multi-level representation of information learned from a large amount of data.

There are several popular deep learning frameworks available, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Caffe. TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google Brain Team, it is widely used for machine learning and deep learning projects. PyTorch is another open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, it is known for its simplicity and ease of use. Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.

It is possible that any of these frameworks or others were used to build the deep learning model for the aerial survey of African wildlife, but the text does not provide enough information to make a definitive statement.
