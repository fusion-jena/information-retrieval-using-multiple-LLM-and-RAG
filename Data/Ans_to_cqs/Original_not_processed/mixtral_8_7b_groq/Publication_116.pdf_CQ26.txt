The provided context discusses an experiment that compares the performance of hand-crafted feature extraction and deep learning approaches for plant identification, using biased and unbiased datasets. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

Based on general knowledge of data preprocessing techniques for deep learning, potential methods to address data bias include:

1. Stratified sampling: This technique involves dividing the dataset into strata based on specific criteria (e.g., class labels) and then ensuring that each stratum is proportionally represented in both the training and testing sets. This can help maintain the balance of classes and reduce bias.
2. Oversampling: In cases where certain classes are underrepresented, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from these classes. This can be done either by duplicating existing instances or by generating synthetic instances using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
3. Undersampling: Conversely, if certain classes are overrepresented, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of instances from these classes. This can be done either randomly or by using techniques like Tomek links to remove instances close to the decision boundary.
4. Diverse data collection: Addressing bias at the data collection stage involves ensuring that the dataset is representative of the target population. This can be achieved by collecting data from various sources, locations, and conditions to ensure that the model is exposed to a wide range of variations.

In the context of the provided experiment, the unbiased dataset appears to be created by attempting to approximate a 70%-30% distribution for each species while avoiding the same specimen bias (SSPB). However, this method does not explicitly address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
