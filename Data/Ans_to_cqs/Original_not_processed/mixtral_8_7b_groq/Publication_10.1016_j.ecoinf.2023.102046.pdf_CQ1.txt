Answer:::

The provided context does not directly discuss the methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the usage of public datasets for training and evaluating deep learning models.

In deep learning, raw data can be collected using various methods, such as:

1. Surveys: Researchers can design and distribute surveys to gather specific data from a targeted population. This method is often used in social sciences and market research.
2. Sensors: Data can be collected using sensors, such as cameras, microphones, or accelerometers. These sensors can be used to gather images, audio, or motion data, respectively.
3. Public datasets: Researchers and organizations often make datasets publicly available for research purposes. These datasets can be used to train and evaluate deep learning models, and they cover a wide range of domains, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

In the context provided, the authors use public datasets to train and evaluate their deep learning models. For instance, the Inception-V3 model is trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains over 1 million images labeled with 1000 categories. Similarly, the CLIP model is trained on a dataset of 400 million images from the web, along with their captions.

Another important aspect of working with raw data in deep learning is handling dataset imbalance. In the context, the authors dealt with dataset imbalance by including class weights in the cross-entropy loss function. This approach helps to ensure that the model is not biased towards the majority class.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss the methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the usage of public datasets for training and evaluating deep learning models. Raw data can be collected using various methods, such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets.
