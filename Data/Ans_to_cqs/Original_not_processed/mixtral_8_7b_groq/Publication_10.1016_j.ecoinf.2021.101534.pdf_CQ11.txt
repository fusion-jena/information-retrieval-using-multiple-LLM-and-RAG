Answer:::
The provided context does not give a direct link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), which is a data repository that stores biodiversity data. It is unclear whether the deep learning pipeline data is stored in GBIF, as the context does not give specific information about this.

Additionally, the context mentions that the test dataset used for the deep learning pipeline was obtained from soundscape recordings, which are usually noisier than focal recordings. This suggests that the test dataset may not be publicly available due to privacy or ethical concerns.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It is recommended to contact the authors of the study for more information about the data and its availability.
