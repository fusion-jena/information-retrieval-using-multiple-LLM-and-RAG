Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific details about how raw data is collected in the deep learning pipeline for acoustic surveys. However, it does mention that the study uses a dataset from a data repository, which suggests that the data was collected and then made publicly available for use in research.

In general, for acoustic surveys, raw data can be collected using various methods such as:

1. Field surveys: These involve placing microphones or other audio recording devices in specific locations to capture sound recordings. Surveys can be conducted in various environments such as forests, grasslands, wetlands, and urban areas.
2. Sensors: Sound recordings can be collected using sensors that are permanently installed in specific locations. These sensors can be programmed to record sound at specific times or in response to specific triggers.
3. Public datasets: Researchers can also use publicly available datasets that have been collected and made available by other researchers or organizations. These datasets can be used to train and test deep learning models.

In the context of the study, it appears that the raw data was collected using microphones or other audio recording devices placed in specific locations. The study then used a deep learning pipeline to analyze the sound recordings and identify bird species.

The pipeline involved several steps, including pre-processing, encoding, temporal framing, bottleneck, reparameterization, decoding, and post-processing. During pre-processing, the raw sound recordings were processed using a 5 Ã— 5 convolution with a wide receptive field and signal coarsening along the time axis. The processed signals were then chunked along the time axis into independent frames, and feature representations were extracted for each frame. These feature representations were then used to output mean and log variance vectors as parameters for the Gaussian variational posterior.

Overall, while the context provided does not give specific details about how raw data was collected for the study, it does provide a detailed description of the deep learning pipeline used to analyze the sound recordings.
