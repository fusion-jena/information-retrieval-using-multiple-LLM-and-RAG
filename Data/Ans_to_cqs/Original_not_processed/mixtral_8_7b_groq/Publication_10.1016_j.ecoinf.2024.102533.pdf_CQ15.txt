Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. The context mainly focuses on fish freshness classification using organoleptic parameters and machine learning techniques, including clustering methods.

However, it is important to note that the choice of optimization techniques often depends on the specific deep learning model being used. In many deep learning applications, popular optimization techniques include SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad. The selection of an optimization technique can significantly impact the training process and the final model performance.

Given that the context discusses a deep learning study for automated fish grading, it is reasonable to assume that some optimization technique was used during the training of the deep learning model. However, without explicit information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is common practice to use optimization techniques like SGD, Adam, RMSprop, or Adagrad in deep learning applications.
