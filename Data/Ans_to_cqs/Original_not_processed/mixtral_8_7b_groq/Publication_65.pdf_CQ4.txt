Answer:::

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include rotation, noise, and flipping. These techniques were used to augment the dataset by six times, aiming to make the CNN classification more robust and help the model generalize better to unseen data.

The DeepLabV3+ architecture, which starts with three blocks composed of two convolutions and one pooling layer, benefits from these data augmentation techniques. After feature extraction and initial prediction map generation, the model employs Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) to extract features at multiple scales, alleviating the loss of spatial information due to prior pooling or convolutions with striding operations.

The data augmentation process involves transforming the original images by applying rotation, introducing noise, and flipping them horizontally. These techniques help increase the diversity of the training data, reducing overfitting and improving the model's ability to generalize.

The learning rate in the training process was reduced following an exponential decay parameter of 0.5 by an SGD scheduler after 50,000 iterations. This adjustment, combined with data augmentation, further contributes to the model's generalization capabilities.

The evaluation process, as depicted in Figure 9, shows the use of these data augmentation techniques in conjunction with the DeepLabV3+ architecture. The TensorFlow framework, running on a 64-bit Intel i7-8700K@3.70GHz CPU workstation with an NVIDIAÂ® GTX 1080 GPU, implemented all deep learning-based models used in this work.

In summary, the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include rotation, noise, and flipping. These techniques were used to augment the dataset, improve the model's robustness, and help the DeepLabV3+ architecture generalize better to unseen data.
