Answer:

The provided context does not contain information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The articles by Lin et al. (2024) and Kattenborn et al. (2020, 2021) focus on the development and evaluation of deep learning models for ecological informatics and vegetation remote sensing, respectively, but they do not mention the platform used for deployment. The paper by Kayet et al. (2021) reviews the applications of convolutional neural networks in vegetation remote sensing but does not provide information on the deployment platforms. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the platform used for deploying the deep learning model.
