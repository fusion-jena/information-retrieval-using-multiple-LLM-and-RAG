The provided pieces of context do not directly discuss data bias techniques in the specific context of deep learning preprocessing. However, they do mention some methods that can be used to handle data bias in machine learning more generally, as well as some related concepts.

One way to address data bias is through diverse data collection. Nathan (2008) highlights the importance of incorporating movement ecology paradigms into organismal movement research, which can help ensure that data is collected in a way that accurately represents the full range of behaviors and movements exhibited by the organisms being studied.

Once data has been collected, there are several techniques that can be used to handle data bias during preprocessing. Stratified sampling is one such technique that is mentioned in the context of spatio-temporal analysis of compositional data (Thorson & Haltuch, 2018). Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into homogeneous subgroups (or "strata") and then selecting a sample from each stratum. This can help ensure that the sample is representative of the population as a whole, even if certain subgroups are underrepresented.

Another way to handle data bias is through oversampling or undersampling. These techniques involve adjusting the class frequencies in the training data to account for imbalances. Oversampling involves creating additional instances of the minority class, while undersampling involves removing instances of the majority class. These techniques can be useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets, but they can also lead to overfitting or underfitting, respectively.

The context also mentions the use of multiple machine learning algorithms and their ensembles to improve the accuracy of estimating habitat selection (Brewster et al., 2018). Ensemble methods, such as bagging and boosting, can help reduce bias and variance in machine learning models. Bagging involves creating multiple subsets of the training data and training a model on each subset, then combining the predictions of each model to make a final prediction. Boosting involves training a sequence of models, with each model focusing on the instances that were misclassified by the previous model.

Finally, the context mentions the use of approximate Bayesian computation (Turner & Van Zandt, 2012) and Bayesian signal extraction (Wang, 2009) as techniques for handling data bias. These methods involve using Bayesian inference to estimate the posterior distribution of the model parameters, given the observed data. By incorporating prior knowledge and uncertainty into the model, these methods can help reduce bias and improve the accuracy of the estimates.

In summary, while the provided pieces of context do not directly discuss data bias techniques in the specific context of deep learning preprocessing, they do mention several related concepts and techniques that can be useful for handling data bias more generally in machine learning. These include diverse data collection, stratified sampling, oversampling and undersampling, ensemble methods, and Bayesian inference.
