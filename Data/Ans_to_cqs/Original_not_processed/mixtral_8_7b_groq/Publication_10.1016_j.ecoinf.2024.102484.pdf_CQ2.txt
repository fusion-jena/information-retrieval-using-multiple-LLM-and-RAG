Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline for land-use type classification and soil degradation assessment can utilize various data formats, including raster images and tabular data.

Raster images are primarily used for remote sensing data, which is essential in this context. For instance, Huang et al. (2019) used high-resolution remotely sensed imagery to monitor ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen. This type of data can provide valuable information about land-use types, natural factors, and anthropogenic factors. The sources for such data can be the World Soil Database (HWSD) or the High-resolution China Soil Information Grids. These datasets can be directly acquired and reclassified using GIS tools such as ArcGIS 10.8.

Tabular data, such as CSV files, can be used for ancillary data related to the study area. For example, population density, GDP density, and point of interest data can be stored in this format. These datasets can be used to analyze the relationship between socio-economic factors and land-use types or soil degradation.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline for land-use type classification and soil degradation assessment can utilize raster images for remote sensing data and tabular data for ancillary information.
