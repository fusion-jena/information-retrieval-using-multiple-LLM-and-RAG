Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps taken after model training in the study. However, it does mention some key aspects of their methodology that can give us an idea about possible postprocessing steps.

First, they used a stratified sampling approach to collect 33,209 samples, which were then split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. They also used 10% of the training data for hyperparameter tuning. This process involved using validation data to tune the key hyperparameters for each model, such as the maximum number of nodes, minimum leaf population, number of trees, bag fraction, variables per split, shrinkage, sampling rate, loss, kernel type, SVM type, and decision procedure.

The models used in this study include CART, RF, GTB, and SVM. These models were trained on the land use and land cover (LULC) classes defined by the USGS 24 LULC classes for WRF simulation.

Considering these details, the following postprocessing steps could have been involved:

1. Metrics calculation: After training and testing the models, they might have calculated various metrics to evaluate their performance. These metrics could include overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, producer's accuracy, user's accuracy, and F1 score.

2. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix could have been created to visualize the performance of the models. This matrix would show the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each LULC class.

3. Saliency maps: Although not explicitly mentioned in the context, saliency maps could have been used to visualize the importance of different features in the classification process. Saliency maps highlight the regions of the input image that have the most influence on the model's output.

Without more specific information from the study, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer regarding the postprocessing steps. However, the mentioned methodology suggests that metrics calculation and confusion matrix are likely to have been used.
