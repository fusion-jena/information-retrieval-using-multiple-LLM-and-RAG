Based on the provided context, there is no information about data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the described deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the use of a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Random Forest (RF) for predicting and gap-filling missing data in evapotranspiration rates (ETa). It describes the configuration of the MLP, including the number of neurons, the use of the Adam solver, the learning rate, and the rectifier activation function. For the RF, it discusses the testing of hyperparameters, including the number of decision trees, maximum depth of the decision tree, and the number of features considered by each tree when splitting a node. However, it does not mention data augmentation techniques.
