Based on the information provided, there are no specific details about postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix following model training. However, there is some information about validation and accuracy assessment of fire risk maps based on vegetation indices using weights of evidence and statistical index models.

In the context, it is mentioned that the study involves validation of the accuracy of fire risk maps based on vegetation indices. This implies that some form of evaluation or assessment of the model's performance was carried out. However, the specific methods or techniques used for this evaluation are not provided.

In addition, there is a reference to a study that used a Bayesian network model for prediction and analysis of possible forest fire causes. This study may have involved postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix, but the information provided does not include any details about these steps.

Therefore, while there is some information about model validation and assessment, there are no specific details about postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix following model training.
