Answer:::

The generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through a combination of measures including environmental cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and the evaluation of predictive accuracy and ecological interpretation of the model's predictors.

Environmental cross-validation with ten folds was performed to accurately represent the new environment's predictive error. This method involves dividing the dataset into ten subsets, or folds, and training the model on nine of the folds while testing it on the remaining fold. This process is repeated ten times, with each fold serving as the test set once. The resulting test errors are then averaged to provide an estimate of the model's predictive accuracy on new, unseen data.

Hyperparameter tuning was carried out using Bayesian optimization focused on reducing the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions. The search space of optimal hyperparameters was defined by the ranges of "mtry" (number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split), "min.node.size" (minimum size of terminal nodes), and "num.trees" (number of trees to grow). This process helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and can therefore generalize well to new data.

Additionally, the predictive accuracy of the trained models was evaluated according to their ecological interpretation of the predictors. Partial Dependence Plots (PDPs) were used to uncover patterns between the model predictors and species-specific productivity. These PDPs were then evaluated using existing scientific knowledge to determine whether the patterns found were ecologically consistent. This step helps to ensure that the model is making sense of the data in a way that aligns with our current understanding of the ecological relationships at play.

Overall, these measures provide a robust approach to ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model for estimating biogeographic patterns of current fungal productivity.
