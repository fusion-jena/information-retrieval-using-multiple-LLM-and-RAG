Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization methods.

However, the context does provide information about various studies that have developed and used species distribution models. For instance, the study by Predicting Species Distributions Working Group (2008) examines the effects of sample size on the performance of species distribution models. Xian et al. (2023) investigate the niche expansion of Crofton weed following invasion in China using species distribution models. Xu, Q., Li, W., Liu, J., Wang, X. (2023a) propose a geographical similarity-based sampling method of non-fire point data for spatial prediction of forest fires. Xu, Q., Zhu, A.-X., Liu, J. (2023b) model land-use change with cellular automata using land natural evolution unit. Zhang, G., Zhu, A.-X. (2018) evaluate the representativeness and spatial bias of volunteered geographic information.

These studies use various methods for developing and validating their models, such as accuracy assessment, cross-validation, and comparing different modeling techniques. However, they do not explicitly mention hyperparameter optimization techniques.

Therefore, while the context provides valuable information about species distribution modeling, it does not answer the query regarding the optimization of hyperparameters.
