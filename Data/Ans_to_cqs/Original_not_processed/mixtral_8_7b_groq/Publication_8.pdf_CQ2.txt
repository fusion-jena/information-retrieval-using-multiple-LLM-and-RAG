Answer:::

Deep learning techniques can be used with various data formats, depending on the specific task and the type of neural network being employed. In the context of image processing for herbarium sheets, the data format of interest is images.

Deep learning models for image processing typically use image data formats as input. These models can handle different image file types, such as JPEG, PNG, or TIFF. For instance, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for extracting image features and require image data as input (LeCun and Bengio 1995).

In some cases, additional data formats might be used alongside images. For instance, when training deep learning models for object detection, annotated data in the form of bounding boxes or segmentation masks might be used. These annotations can be stored in separate files, often in JSON or XML format, alongside the image files.

For other applications of deep learning, such as natural language processing or time series analysis, different data formats might be used. For example, text data can be used in the form of plain text files or CSV files, while audio or video data can be used in formats like WAV or MP4.

In summary, deep learning pipelines can handle various data formats, including images, text, audio, and video. The specific data format used depends on the task at hand and the type of deep learning model being employed. In the context of herbarium sheet processing, image data formats are the most relevant.
