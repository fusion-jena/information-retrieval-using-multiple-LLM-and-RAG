Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about any deep learning pipeline or specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses the use of camera trap data in the context of machine learning models, specifically Random Forest (RF) and Generalized Linear Models (GLM), for predicting species distribution.

The camera trap dataset consists of presence and absence locations of several felid species. The dataset was used to train RF models using two different training data selection frameworks: non-bootstrapped RF and bootstrapped RF. In the non-bootstrapped RF approach, the model was trained using 80% of the randomly selected camera trap locations. In contrast, the bootstrapped RF approach involved subsampling the entire camera trap dataset by randomly selecting 20% of the presence and absence locations, and then training RF models with the subsampled dataset. This process was repeated 100 times, and the final species distribution probability surfaces were obtained by averaging the 100 probability surfaces.

Furthermore, the context mentions that the structure of the training data can have profound effects on the outcomes of models trained with the RF algorithm. A recent paper from the group showed that the spatial pattern and shape of the environmental manifold itself affect the performance of GLM and RF.

Therefore, while the context provides valuable information about the use of camera trap data in machine learning models, it does not mention any deep learning pipeline or specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
