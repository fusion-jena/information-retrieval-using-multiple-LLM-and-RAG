Answer:

The text does not provide a specific list of datasets equivalent to MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet that are used in the deep learning pipeline for point cloud segmentation. However, it does mention several datasets that are relevant to the research in this area.

The Oakland dataset, which contains fewer than 2 million markers, is mentioned as an example of a dataset that is not rich enough for training classifiers in complex real-world scenes. The New York University (NYU) benchmark is mentioned as a popular benchmark for point cloud segmentation, but it only provides point clouds in indoor scenes.

The Sydney city object dataset and the IQmulus & TerraMobilita competition dataset are mentioned as datasets that were scanned by a 3D Velodyne LiDAR mounted on a car, which measures fewer points than a static scanner. The Semantic3D benchmark is mentioned as a benchmark that provides more than 4 billion points in total, which include 8 categories: artificial terrain, natural terrain, high vegetation, and others.

Therefore, while the text does not provide a specific list of datasets equivalent to MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it does mention several datasets that are relevant to the research in point cloud segmentation using deep learning. These datasets include the Oakland dataset, the NYU benchmark, the Sydney city object dataset, the IQmulus & TerraMobilita competition dataset, and the Semantic3D benchmark.
