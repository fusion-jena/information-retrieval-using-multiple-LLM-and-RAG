Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline is used for fish species identification in video data. The data preprocessing step involves working with video frames and labeling them with the help of biology experts. Then, some frames are cropped to create a training database of fish thumbnails. These thumbnails are the primary data format used in this deep learning pipeline. The thumbnails are images with a varying size, ranging from a minimum of 20 × 40 pixels to a maximum of 150 × 200 pixels. Each thumbnail contains a single labeled fish or the background. The background class consists of random thumbnails from the natural background and specific background thumbnails taken around the fish thumbnails.

There is no explicit mention of other data formats like audio, video, or CSV in the provided context. The deep learning architecture follows GoogLeNet's with 27 layers, 9 inception layers, and a soft-max classifier. The inception layers help reduce the dimension of the thumbnails to one pixel, making the model less dependent on the dimensional impact.

In the post-processing step, motion scores are computed for each sliding window to define a motion score based on the hypothesis that most fishes are moving. However, the context does not mention any other data formats being used in this deep learning pipeline.
