Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the description of the proposed network, SeedNet, provided in the study. The network consists of several layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and a fully-connected layer, all of which are typical components of a CNN. Additionally, the study mentions the use of a Max pooling strategy, which is commonly employed in CNNs to reduce the dimensionality of the data and prevent overfitting. The input image size of 224 × 224 × 3 is also typical for CNNs. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in this study is a CNN.
