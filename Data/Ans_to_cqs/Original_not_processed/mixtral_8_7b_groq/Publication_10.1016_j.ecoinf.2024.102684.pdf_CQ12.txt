Answer:::
Based on the provided context, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is used in the pipeline. This is inferred from the mention of pre-trained networks, which typically refer to CNN architectures like VGG16, ResNet, or Inception. These networks have convolution operations that efficiently extract patterns within images. The fully connected network added at the end of these pre-trained networks is also a common component of CNN models. However, the context does not mention Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformers. Therefore, it can be concluded that a CNN model is used in this pipeline.
