Answer: Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting that were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the model was trained with a large dataset of 43 bird species, which could contribute to its generalizability. 

In terms of the model's architecture, a VGG-style network was used, which has been previously used for classifying acoustic scenes. The network was trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10âˆ’4, and the categorical cross entropy was utilized as the loss function. These choices could also impact the model's generalizability.

Furthermore, the authors also employed a different deep learning architecture, SubSpectralNet, to classify bird sounds. They found that fusing selected deep learning models could effectively increase the classification performance. This approach of combining multiple models could potentially improve the model's generalizability as well.

Overall, while the context does not provide explicit information on measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the use of a large dataset, a proven architecture, and model fusion could contribute to the model's ability to generalize to new data.
