Unfortunately, the provided context does not specify the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. There are several details provided about the pipeline, the model architecture, and the training process, but there is no information about where the data used in this study is stored or hosted. It is possible that the data is not publicly available due to privacy or ethical concerns related to the ecological community being studied. If the data repository becomes available in the future, it would be a valuable resource for other researchers interested in replicating or building upon this work.
