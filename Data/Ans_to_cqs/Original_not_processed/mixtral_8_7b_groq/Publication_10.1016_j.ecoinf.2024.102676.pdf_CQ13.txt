Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning model being used in the study. The methods mentioned are both intuitive (omitting missing values, mean imputation) and machine-learning-based (FIT method), but no deep learning models are mentioned. Furthermore, the parameters mentioned for the FIT method are the number of selected variables in the model, the size of the confidence ellipsoid (counter probability), and the cut-off threshold value of the distances between the geometrical mean of the trails (Wards-cut-off distance). No details about hyperparameters for a deep learning model, such as learning rate or optimizer, are provided. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
