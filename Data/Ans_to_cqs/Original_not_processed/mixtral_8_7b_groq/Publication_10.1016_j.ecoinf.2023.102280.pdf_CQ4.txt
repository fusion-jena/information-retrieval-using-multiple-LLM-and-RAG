Based on the provided context, the data augmentation techniques specifically mentioned for bioacoustics applications are superimposing noise samples. This technique involves overlaying noise onto the audio data to increase the amount of available data and introduce more variability. This can help improve the robustness and performance of deep learning-based denoising models, especially when dealing with limited training data or abundant noise features.

The context does not explicitly mention other common data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotation, or scaling, which are typically associated with image data. However, it is important to note that the choice of data augmentation techniques depends on the specific application and data modality.

In the context of deep learning-based denoising for bioacoustics, the focus is on addressing the challenges of limited training data and abundant noise features. The suggested approach for data augmentation, superimposing noise samples, is tailored to these specific challenges.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention flipping, rotation, or scaling as data augmentation techniques for deep learning-based denoising in bioacoustics, it does mention superimposing noise samples as a relevant technique for addressing the unique challenges of this application.
