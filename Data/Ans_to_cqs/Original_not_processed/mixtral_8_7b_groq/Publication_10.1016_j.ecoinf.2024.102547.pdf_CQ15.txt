Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the analysis of the multifrequency acoustics dataset acquired from scientific echosounders in the West African waters.

The text mainly focuses on the use of Fisheries acoustics techniques for data collection and spatial-functional data analysis for understanding the spatial arrangement of marine organism aggregations. It mentions the use of dimension reduction techniques and supervised and unsupervised methods, but it does not specify any optimization techniques used in a deep learning context.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to accurately answer the query regarding the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline.
