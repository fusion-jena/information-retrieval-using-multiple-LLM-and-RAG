I don't know the answer to the query regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer, as they were not provided in the context. The context does mention the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) but does not include details about the specific hyperparameters chosen for the model. Additionally, the focus of the provided context is on the comparison of partial least-squares regression (PLSR) models for estimating total nitrogen (TN) in soil, using various data preprocessing techniques.

The context does provide information on the dataset and methods used for the PLSR models. The dataset is from the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP), and the study aims to identify important spectral bands for estimating TN using PLSR models. Several data preprocessing techniques are compared, including continuum removal (CR), the successive projections algorithm (SPA), the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), the weight average partial least-squares regression (WAPLSR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and the continuous wavelet transformation (CWT).

The context also includes tables listing the number of principal components (PC) and important spectral bands for each PLSR model. However, there is no information on the deep learning model's hyperparameters, such as the learning rate or optimizer. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
