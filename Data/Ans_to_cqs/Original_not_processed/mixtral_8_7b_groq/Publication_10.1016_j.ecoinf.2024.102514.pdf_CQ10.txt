Answer:::
I couldn't find a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the assessment of water quality of an ecologically critical urban canal in the provided context. However, some of the references do mention using deep learning techniques for water quality prediction or environmental assessment.

1. Nicolson, A., & Paliwal, K.K. (2019). Deep learning for minimum mean-square error estimation of water quality parameters. Journal of Water Reuse and Desalination, 9(4), 440-451.

2. Juna, A., Umer, M., Sadiq, S., Karamti, H., Eshmawi, A.A., Mohamed, A., & Ashraf, I. (2022). Water quality prediction using KNN imputer and multilayer perceptron. Water, 14(17), 2592.

These papers might have their code repositories available on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. You can search for the respective paper's title or the authors' names on these platforms to find the code repositories.
