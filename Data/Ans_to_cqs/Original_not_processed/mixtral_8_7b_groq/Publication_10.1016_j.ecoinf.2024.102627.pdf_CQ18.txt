Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the final test set performances at epoch 69 are A30 = 0.87 and MSA30 = 0.48, which implies that the performance was measured at the end of the 69th epoch using two evaluation metrics.

The first metric, A30, measures the accuracy of the model in returning the correct label among the first 30 species for 87% of the test observations. This metric is representative of common species, as it focuses on the top 30 species that the model is most confident in predicting.

The second metric, MSA30, measures the accuracy of the model when each species in the test set is given the same weight. The model correctly identifies the label within the first 30 classes returned almost half the time, which is a challenging task given that the test set contains 4166 species.

Although the context does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training, it can be inferred that the model's performance was evaluated using these two metrics at the end of the 69th epoch. It is possible that performance was also monitored during training using validation sets or other evaluation metrics, but this information is not provided in the context.
