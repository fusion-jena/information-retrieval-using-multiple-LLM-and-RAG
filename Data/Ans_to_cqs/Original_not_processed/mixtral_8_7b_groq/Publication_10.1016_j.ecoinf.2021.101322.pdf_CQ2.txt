Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline utilizes image data formats. Specifically, the context refers to the training of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on image data. The "Salmon scale 9056 image dataset" and the "expert reading of extra 150 image dataset" are used for training a CNN-based architecture, EfficientNet, in a project funded by the Research Council of Norway. Pre-trained network weights for EfficientNet-B4 are also provided in the context. Therefore, it can be concluded that image data formats are used in this deep learning pipeline.

However, the context does not explicitly mention other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV. Therefore, based on the provided context, it cannot be confirmed if these data formats are used in the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that the pipeline only involves image data.
