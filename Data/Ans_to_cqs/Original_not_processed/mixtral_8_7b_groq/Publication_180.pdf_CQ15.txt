Answer:::
The provided context discusses the use of TensorFlow, an open-source software platform for deep learning, in the development of an automated system for identifying Chagas disease vectors. However, it does not explicitly mention any optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.

However, it can be inferred that some optimization techniques were applied in the process of adjusting the parameters of the deep learning model. Specifically, the validation percentage and the number of training steps were modified from their default values. Adjusting the number of training steps can be seen as a form of learning rate scheduling, which is a technique used to improve the convergence of stochastic gradient descent.

Additionally, the fact that TensorFlow was used, an open-source software platform that represents the most recent addition to the deep learning toolbox, it can be assumed that the pipeline used state-of-the-art optimization techniques. TensorFlow supports a wide range of optimization algorithms, including SGD, Adam, Adagrad, Adadelta, and many others.

It is also worth noting that TensorFlow allows for the easy implementation of techniques such as learning rate decay, momentum, and regularization, which can help to improve the performance and generalization of deep learning models.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention any optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that some optimization techniques were applied, such as learning rate scheduling. Additionally, it can be assumed that the pipeline used state-of-the-art optimization techniques supported by TensorFlow, such as SGD, Adam, Adagrad, Adadelta, and others.
