Answer:::
The specific evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the deep learning models in the study are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that DeepLabV3+ achieved the best performance in terms of "absolute average accuracies" and "variability for the test set." This suggests that average accuracy and variability were used as metrics, but it is possible that other metrics such as precision, recall, or F1 score were also used. The study mainly focuses on comparing the number of parameters, training time, and inference time of different models.
