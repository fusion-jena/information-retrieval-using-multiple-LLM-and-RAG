Answer:::

The initial version of the BA (Burned Area) algorithm implemented in FIREMAP uses raster data format, specifically the atmospherically corrected, harmonized Sentinel-2 (S2) post-fire Level-2A scenes from the COPERNICUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED dataset in Google Earth Engine (GEE) starting from 2018. The algorithm relies on a supervised machine learning (ML) classification to acquire a BA vector of the region of interest.

The BA algorithm uses individual spectral bands from S2 Level-2A scenes, rather than context-dependent, broadband spectral indices, to discriminate the burned signal. This approach allows for a mono-temporal perspective, maximizing the synergistic potential of S2 near-infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and red-edge (RE) indices.

The algorithm's output, the BA vector, can be exported to the user's Google Drive account in the preferred raster format for the region of interest.

It is important to note that the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of other data formats, such as image, audio, video, or CSV, in the deep learning pipeline. The pipeline primarily focuses on raster data from S2 Level-2A scenes.
