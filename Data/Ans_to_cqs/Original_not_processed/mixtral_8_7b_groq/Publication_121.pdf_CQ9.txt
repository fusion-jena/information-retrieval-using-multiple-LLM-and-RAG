Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used for tree species identification. It discusses the use of Android Studio and TensorFlow Lite for app development, as well as the training of models using MobileNetV2, MobileNetV3-Large, and MobileNetV3-Small on a dataset divided into a training set of 5789 images and a test set of 1930 images. However, it does not mention where the dataset or the trained models are stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
