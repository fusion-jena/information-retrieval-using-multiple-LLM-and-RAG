Answer:::

The raw data in the deep learning pipeline for land cover classification is collected using a combination of field surveys and remote sensing imagery. However, due to the challenges in gathering field data, such as time and access constraints in croplands and other remote environments, researchers may opt to use imagery for obtaining training and validation sample points. This method involves image interpretation for sample selection, which has been done in this study, and allows for the efficient gathering of a higher number of training samples, resulting in a larger sample collection size.

The imagery used for raw data collection includes Sentinel-2 data, which provides visible (red, green, and blue) bands, as well as twelve multispectral (MS) bands. Additionally, other features are derived from the Sentinel-2 data, such as spectral indices, spectral features, and textural features. Furthermore, Sentinel-1 bands and Digital Surface Model (DSM) data are also used in the imagery. These different feature batches are analyzed using McNemar's test to determine their impact on the land cover classification.

The initial datasets used in the study include true color composites, false-color composites, RedEdge1-RedEdge2-RedEdge3 color composites, RedEdge4-SWIR1-SWIR2 color composites, Sentinel-1 data, and AW3D30. These datasets are used to create a visual representation of the study area, which helps in the interpretation and analysis of the land cover classification.

In summary, the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected through a combination of field surveys and remote sensing imagery, including Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data, as well as derived features such as spectral indices and textural features. The use of imagery for sample selection allows for a larger sample collection size, which is analyzed using McNemar's test to determine the impact of different feature batches on land cover classification.
