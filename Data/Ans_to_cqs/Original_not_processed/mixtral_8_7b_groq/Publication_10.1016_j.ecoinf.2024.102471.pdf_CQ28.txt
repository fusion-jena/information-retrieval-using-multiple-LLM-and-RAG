Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the specific platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model for bird species classification. The context focuses on the effectiveness of deep learning in classifying birds based on their calls, the use of transfer learning, and the training of models on large audio datasets. It also mentions a GUI output for an audio sample with three bird species and graphs showing loss and accuracy by varying epochs. However, it does not mention any details about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
