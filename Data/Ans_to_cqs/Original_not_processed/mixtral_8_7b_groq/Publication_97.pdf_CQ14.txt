Answer:::

The hyperparameters of the model were optimized using a grid search technique. A grid search is a systematic approach to tuning the parameters of a machine learning model. It involves defining a finite grid of parameter values and then training the model with all possible combinations of these values. In this specific case, the U-Net architecture's hyperparameters were tuned using a grid search over the following combinations of parameters: num_layers = {64, 32, 16}, depth = {2, 3, 4}, layer_rate = {2, 1.5, 1.2}, batch_norm = {True, False}, residual = {True, False}, dropout = {0, 0.5}. This resulted in a total of 216 different U-Net-like architectures being tested. The best-performing models were found to have a number of layers equal to 64 and dropout applied. The best model, which also included batch normalization, had the following parameters: num_layers = 64, depth = 4, layer_rate = 2, batch_norm = True, residual = False, dropout = 0.5.
