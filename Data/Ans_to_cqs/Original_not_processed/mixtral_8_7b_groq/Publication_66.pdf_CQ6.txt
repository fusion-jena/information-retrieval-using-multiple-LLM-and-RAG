Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly mentioned what preprocessing steps were taken before training the deep learning models. However, it can be inferred that some data preparation was done to the GPS track data used in the analysis.

Firstly, the authors used variation in longitude and latitude, altitude, and coverage ratio (proportion of possible fixes acquired within a set window of time) as variables to train the deep learning models. This suggests that the raw GPS data was processed to extract these features.

Secondly, the authors mentioned that different combinations of these variables were used to explore the qualities of different models. This implies that some feature engineering or selection was performed on the data.

Lastly, the authors compared the predictions from deep learning models with other alternative prediction methods such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), a na√Øve Bayes classifier, and speed and tortuosity predictions. These comparisons suggest that the data was prepared in a consistent format for each of these methods.

Therefore, while the specific preprocessing steps are not detailed in the provided context, it is clear that some data preparation was done, including feature extraction, feature engineering/selection, and data formatting.
