Answer:::
 Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions the DeepLinks project, which is funded by NERC, and the MISSION ATLANTIC project, funded by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program. However, it does not specify where the data or code for the deep learning pipeline is stored or hosted. The study acknowledges various individuals and teams who assisted in the collection and processing of data, as well as the developers of Biigle who provided support throughout the development of the workflow. However, there is no mention of a data repository or open-access platform where the deep learning pipeline can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
