The provided context does not contain specific information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some studies and tasks where weakly supervised learning is used, such as predictive modeling of global vegetation cover, cancer image segmentation and classification, and semantic annotation of high-resolution satellite images. These tasks likely involve image data, but the context does not explicitly state this.

In general, deep learning can be applied to various data formats, including but not limited to images, audio, video, and CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific task and the type of data available. For instance, image data is commonly used in computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation, while time-series data (e.g., in CSV format) is often used in natural language processing and speech recognition tasks.
