Based on the provided sources, it is not possible to directly determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of a specific deep learning model. However, some of the sources do mention techniques that are commonly used to improve the generalizability of deep learning models.

First, creating a diverse dataset is an important step towards ensuring the generalizability of a deep learning model. This is because a diverse dataset can help the model learn a wider range of patterns and features, which can improve its ability to make accurate predictions on new data. For example, in the context of bioacoustic classification, it would be beneficial to include a wide variety of species, calls, and environmental conditions in the training data. This is supported by the recommendation in Soldevilla et al. (2008) that training data for beaked whale classification should include a high level of confidence and be especially critical for species with small sample sizes.

Second, cross-validation is a technique that can be used to improve the generalizability of a deep learning model. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, or folds, and training the model on different subsets of the data. This can help to reduce overfitting, which occurs when the model becomes too specialized to the training data and performs poorly on new data.

Third, stratified splitting is another technique that can be used to improve the generalizability of a deep learning model. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subsets in a way that ensures that each subset has a similar distribution of classes. This can help to ensure that the model is exposed to a representative sample of each class during training, which can improve its ability to make accurate predictions on new data.

In summary, while it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of a specific deep learning model based on the provided sources, creating a diverse dataset, using cross-validation, and employing stratified splitting are all techniques that can be used to improve the generalizability of deep learning models.
