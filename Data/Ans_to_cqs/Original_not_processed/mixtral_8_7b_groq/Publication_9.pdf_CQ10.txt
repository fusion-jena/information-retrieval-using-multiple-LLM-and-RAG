Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text describes a study by Schwartz and Alfaro (2021) that developed a toolkit called Sashimi for facilitating high-throughput organismal image segmentation using deep learning. However, it does not mention where the code for this toolkit is hosted. If you are interested in accessing the code, I would recommend reaching out to the authors directly at the provided correspondence email (shawnschwartz@ucla.edu) to inquire about the code repository.
