Answer:::
The deep learning model in the study is used for the purpose of object detection and relation detection. Specifically, it is used to identify and track the animals in wildlife videos, and to extract their location boxes. This is achieved through the use of a Siamese relation network, which consists of a relation detector module and a refinement module. The relation detector module is equipped with three nonlinear detectors that compare the relationships between the features generated by the target and multi-scale regression features. These detectors use pixel-wise, patch-wise, and global features to make comparisons. The refinement module then converts the output of the relation detector into a matching score.

In addition to object detection and relation detection, the deep learning model is also used for motion monitoring. Based on the location boxes extracted by the model, the motion trajectories of the animals are obtained using the coordinates of the centroid points of the location boxes. The motion trajectory is then segmented into a series of periodic curves, and the motion trajectory patterns are classified by calculating cross-correlation functions.

The deep learning model is used for the purpose of providing real-time warning prompts for stereotypical behaviors through a human-computer interaction interface. This allows animal management personnel to easily initiate the model to automatically record, store, and display the motion trajectories of the animals.

Overall, the deep learning model in the study serves multiple purposes, including object detection, relation detection, motion monitoring, and the classification of motion trajectory patterns. These capabilities enable the model to provide real-time warning prompts for stereotypical behaviors, which can be useful for animal management and conservation efforts.
