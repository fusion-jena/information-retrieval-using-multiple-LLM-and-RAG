Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is regression, specifically for predicting Total Suspended Solids (TSI) in water bodies. The model is built using a three-layer Back Propagation (BP) Artificial Neural Network in MATLAB R2014b. The input layer consists of two parameters, aCDOM(254) and Fn(355), while the intermediate and output layers each contain a single neuron that corresponds to the predictor (TSI). The model is trained with a maximum of 10,000 iterations and a training error of 0.001. The model is calibrated using 64 water samples, with the remaining samples used for validation. The validation accuracy is assessed by calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI values. The RMSE is determined using the formula provided in the context, which takes the square root of the average of the squared differences between the measured and predicted TSI values.
