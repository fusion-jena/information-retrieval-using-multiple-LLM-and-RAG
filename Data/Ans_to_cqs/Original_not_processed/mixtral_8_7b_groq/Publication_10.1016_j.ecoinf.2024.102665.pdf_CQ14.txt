Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, it is mentioned that an automated expectation-maximization process was used to identify the optimal number of cluster states for each taxon. This process aimed to minimize the Minimum Description Length (MDL) score through a random walk with 300 steps. The final ten steps were then used to check for stability and determine the number of clusters for each taxon.

Additionally, the R2-GenOpt procedure in BayesiaLab was used for discretization prior to analysis, which involves genetic optimization to maximize the R2 between the original raw data distribution and the density created by the discretization. However, this process pertains to data preprocessing and not specifically to hyperparameter optimization.

Therefore, while some automated optimization processes were employed in the analysis, the provided context does not explicitly mention any grid search, random search, or other hyperparameter optimization methods.
