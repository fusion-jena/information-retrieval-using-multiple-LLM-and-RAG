Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework was used to build the model. However, it can be inferred that the model was built using a deep learning framework that is compatible with ResNet-50 and SVM (Support Vector Machine) models.

The ResNet-50 model is a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that was developed and pre-trained using millions of label images in over 1000 categories using the Torch library, which was later integrated into PyTorch. Therefore, it is possible that the deep learning model was built using PyTorch.

On the other hand, the SVM classifier is a machine learning algorithm that can be implemented using various deep learning frameworks, including TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that the deep learning model was built using either TensorFlow or PyTorch, but the specific framework is not explicitly mentioned.
