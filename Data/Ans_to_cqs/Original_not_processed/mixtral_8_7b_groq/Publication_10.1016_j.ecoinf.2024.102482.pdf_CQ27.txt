Answer:::

While the text provided does not give a detailed description of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it does offer some insights that can help us infer the general steps taken.

The model used in this study is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model particularly suited for learning and predicting time-series data. The authors applied this model to improve the performance of a water quality monitoring system using the swimming behavior of C. elegans as an early warning indicator for water pollution.

The first step in deploying a trained model is usually model serialization, which involves saving the model's architecture, learned weights, and other relevant information into a file. This file can then be used to recreate the model without having to retrain it, significantly reducing computation time and resources. Although not explicitly mentioned, it is highly likely that the authors serialized their model, as this is a common practice in deep learning projects.

The second step is platform selection. The authors emphasized designing a simple model structure to ensure usability on devices with limited computing power and enable real-time predictions. This suggests that the model was intended to run on edge devices or systems with restricted computational resources. However, the text does not provide specific details about the chosen platform.

After selecting the platform, the serialized model would be loaded onto the target device, and any necessary preprocessing of input data would be applied before feeding it into the model for prediction. Again, the text does not provide specifics about this stage of the deployment process.

In summary, while the text does not give a comprehensive description of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it is possible to infer that the authors likely serialized their model and intended it to run on devices with limited computing power. However, specific details about platform selection and loading the model onto the target device are not provided.
