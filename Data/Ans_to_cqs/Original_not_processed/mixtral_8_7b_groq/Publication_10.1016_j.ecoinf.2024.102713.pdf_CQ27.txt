The provided context does not include information about the training and deployment of a deep learning model for H. halys captures. However, it does provide details about the data platform components and data sources used in the CASE system.

The data platform components include data sources, integration and enrichment processes, validation and loading processes, and analytical fruition. The data sources mainly consist of a monitoring network managed by CASE, which provides weekly updates on H. halys captures and associated environmental elements. The integration and enrichment processes are materialized in the Harbor tier of the data platform, providing an integrated and comprehensive view of the available data at the finest level of detail. The validation and loading processes are discussed in Section 3.2.3, but it does not mention any deep learning model validation or loading.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model for H. halys captures.
