Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context contains information about various machine learning models such as regression, neural networks, logistic regression, gradient boosted trees, random forests, and XGBoost, but it does not mention any details about the hardware resources used for training these models.

Machine learning models can be trained on various hardware resources such as CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs. CPUs are general-purpose processors that can handle a wide variety of tasks, while GPUs are specialized processors designed to accelerate graphical processing and are well-suited for parallel computations required in machine learning. TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) are custom-built hardware developed by Google for machine learning applications, particularly for training large-scale deep learning models.

In the context, there is a reference to a deep learning model in the keyword list, but there is no further information about the hardware resources used for training the model. The context mainly focuses on the application of machine learning models for estimating aboveground biomass using remote sensing data and field data in temperate forests of the Himalayan region.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.
