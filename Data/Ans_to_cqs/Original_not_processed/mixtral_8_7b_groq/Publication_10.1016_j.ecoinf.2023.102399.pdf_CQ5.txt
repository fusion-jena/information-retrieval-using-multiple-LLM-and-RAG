Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for fish biomass estimation. However, it does mention several studies that have utilized deep learning techniques for fish detection, species classification, and biomass estimation.

One of the studies mentioned is by Ravanbakhsh et al. (2015), which implemented a deep learning technique to automatically detect and identify the head and mouth of Southern Bluefin tuna. While the study does not specify the dataset used, it mentions using the Haar classifier for recognizing the fish's head and mouth in specific positions within underwater stereo images.

Another study by Fernandes et al. (2020) combined computer vision with deep learning for fish biomass estimation. Again, the study does not explicitly mention the dataset used in their deep learning pipeline.

It is also worth noting that the study by Gao et al. (2019) introduced a new deep learning architecture called Pixel Transformed Convolutional Networks (PTCNs) for image segmentation tasks. Although the study does not directly relate to fish biomass estimation, the introduced architecture could be used for preprocessing fish images in a deep learning pipeline.

In addition, the study by Huang et al. (2016) presented an in-chute based automated fish length measurement system using acoustic and signal processing techniques. While the study does not use deep learning, it could provide a dataset for fish length measurement, which could be used as a proxy for fish biomass estimation.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for fish biomass estimation, it does mention several studies that have utilized deep learning techniques for fish-related tasks. Additionally, it provides some potential sources for fish-related datasets that could be used in a deep learning pipeline for fish biomass estimation.
