Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for training a deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is clear that for the Random Forest classifier, which is used in the hierarchical classification model, the data is split into training, validation, and testing sets with a proportion of 70:20:10. This splitting strategy is applied to both levels of the hierarchical classification model, as well as to the new datasets RTL80 and RTP4
