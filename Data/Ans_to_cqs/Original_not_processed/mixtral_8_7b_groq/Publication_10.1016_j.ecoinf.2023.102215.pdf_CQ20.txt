Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the model's training time and computational performance are evaluated, which suggests that high-performance computing hardware was used.

In deep learning model training, graphics processing units (GPUs) are commonly used due to their ability to perform parallel computations, which is essential for handling the large number of computations required in deep learning. Additionally, tensor processing units (TPUs) are specialized hardware developed by Google for machine learning tasks, providing high-performance and energy-efficient computations.

Given the complexity of the model and the comparative analysis of computational performance presented in the context, it is reasonable to assume that either GPUs or TPUs were used for training the deep learning model. However, without explicit information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
