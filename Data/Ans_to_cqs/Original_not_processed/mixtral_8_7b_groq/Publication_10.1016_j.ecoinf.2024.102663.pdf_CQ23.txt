Based on the information provided, it is not explicitly stated which measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications that certain steps were taken to improve the model's performance and applicability.

First, the dataset seems to be diverse, as it includes images of a specific fish species, Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia (GIFT), with varying biomass ranging from 10-126 g. This range of biomass might help the model to learn different features of the same species, thus improving its ability to generalize.

Second, four preprocessing techniques were applied to the dataset: white balance, gamma correction, sharpening, dehazing, and denoising. These methods were used to enhance image quality and reduce noise, which could help the model to focus on relevant features and improve its performance on new, unprocessed images.

Third, Table 3 presents the results of YOLOv8 after applying the preprocessing techniques. Comparing the performance of the model with and without preprocessing can provide insights into the impact of these techniques on the model's generalizability.

Lastly, there are several figures (Fig. 13 to Fig. 17) showing experiments with different learning rates, epochs, and optimizers. These experiments might have been conducted to find the best set of hyperparameters for the model, which could indirectly contribute to the model's generalizability.

However, without explicit information on techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or data augmentation, it is difficult to definitively state that these measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
