The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of digital camera images for data collection. It is likely that these images are used as input to the deep learning model, but the context does not confirm this.

The study described in the context focuses on the use of footprints to classify the sex of free-ranging Amur tigers. The data collected includes trail IDs and footprint images, which are then subjected to sex discrimination analysis. The analysis is performed on a total of 212 footprint images collected from 12 trails.

The equipment required for data collection includes a basic digital camera or smartphone, a metric scale, and a laptop computer for running the required analyses. The images are stored on an external or cloud-based drive.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline likely uses image data as input. However, the context does not explicitly mention other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV.
