The provided context does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the deep learning model being used is a ResNet-50 convolutional neural network (CNN) that has been pre-trained on over 1 million images from the ImageNet database. This pre-trained model is then fine-tuned for the specific task of detecting polar bears.

In general, data annotation techniques for deep learning models can include:

1. Image-level annotation: This involves labeling an entire image with a single class or category. For example, an image might be labeled as "polar bear" or "no polar bear."
2. Bounding box annotation: This involves drawing a bounding box around an object of interest in an image and labeling the box with the class or category of the object. For example, a bounding box might be drawn around a polar bear and labeled as "polar bear."
3. Semantic segmentation: This involves dividing an image into multiple regions or segments, each of which is labeled with a class or category. For example, an image of a polar bear in its natural habitat might be divided into segments labeled "polar bear," "snow," "ice," and "water."
4. Instance segmentation: This is a more advanced form of semantic segmentation that involves not only dividing an image into segments, but also distinguishing between individual instances of objects within the same class. For example, an image of multiple polar bears might be divided into segments labeled "polar bear 1," "polar bear 2," etc.

It is possible that one or more of these data annotation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context, but the specific methods are not mentioned.
