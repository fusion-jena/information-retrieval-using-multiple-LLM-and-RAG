Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It discusses the development of deep learning methodologies for underwater fish video processing in turbid waters and the creation of a new fish dataset, FishInTurbidWater, for this purpose. The context also explains that two novel deep learning networks were developed using semi-supervised contrastive learning and weakly-supervised learning. However, it does not include information about the hardware resources used for training these models.
