Answer:::
The data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Turab et al. is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the study was funded by several organizations, including the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, the Generalitat Valenciana, Spain, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), and the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT). It is possible that the data repository is maintained by one of these organizations or associated institutions.

It is also mentioned that the study used data from the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation, the Generalitat Valenciana, Spain, and the National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT) for the projects TRIVIAL, CORTEX, NL4DISMIS, and N41A640092. It is possible that the data repository is associated with one of these projects or funding sources.

In addition, the study cites several references that may have relevant data repositories. These references include studies by Alvarez (2021), Aoki (1950), Yang and Mailman (2018), Yerkes (1912), and Zhang et al. (2015). It is possible that the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Turab et al. is associated with one of these references.

Therefore, while the specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Turab et al. is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is possible that it is associated with one of the funding sources, projects, or references mentioned in the context.
