Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific details about the values of the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models. However, it does mention that deep learning networks outperformed other baselines in a study on bat acoustic signal detection. The deep learning model used in this study is called CNNFAST, which consists of two convolution layers, each followed by a max pooling layer, and ending with a fully connected layer. The output of the detector is a probability vector.

In addition, the context mentions a study that used a deep learning model called CNNFULL, which consisted of three convolution and max pooling layers, followed by one fully connected layer. This model was used for a binary classification problem in the context of passive acoustic monitoring for bat call detection. The input to the CNN was a spectrogram, which was reduced in size to 130 frequency bins by 20 time steps.

To increase the speed of the system, the sliding window approach was applied to predict the presence of a search-phase bat call at every instance of time in the spectrogram. However, the context does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in the CNNFAST or CNNFULL models, such as the learning rate, optimizer, number of epochs, batch size, etc.

Therefore, we cannot provide a specific answer to the query regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models mentioned in the context.
