Answer:::
The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing.

The training set is used to train the model, which involves adjusting the model's parameters to minimize the difference between the model's predictions and the actual values. The validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters, which are the parameters that are set before training and cannot be learned from the data. The testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

In the context of groundwater-climate interactions and drought analysis, the data could be split based on various factors such as time, location, or drought intensity. For example, the data could be split based on time, where one portion of the data is used for training, another portion for validation, and the remaining portion for testing. Alternatively, the data could be split based on location, where data from certain regions is used for training, data from other regions is used for validation, and data from yet other regions is used for testing.

Another approach could be to split the data based on drought intensity, where data from certain drought intensity categories is used for training, data from other categories is used for validation, and data from yet other categories is used for testing. This approach could be useful in ensuring that the model is able to accurately predict drought intensity, duration, and severity across a range of conditions.

Overall, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training will depend on the specific research question and the characteristics of the data. It is important to carefully consider the split criteria to ensure that the model is able to accurately predict groundwater-climate interactions and drought characteristics.
