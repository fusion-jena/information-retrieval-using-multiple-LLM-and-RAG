Answer: In the context provided, the data for deep learning model training, specifically for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier, is split based on the following criteria:

1. Training set: This is the portion of the data used to train the model. For the Ziziphus lotus shrubs classification problem, the training set consists of 80 images of Ziziphus lotus shrubs and 80 images of bare soil with sparse vegetation, each image being an 80x80-pixel patch. These images are used to iteratively adjust the model's weights to minimize the prediction loss.

2. Validation set: This is a separate subset of the data used to validate the model during the training process. The validation set helps to tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. For the Ziziphus lotus shrubs classification problem, the validation set consists of 20 images of each class, i.e., Ziziphus lotus shrubs and bare soil with sparse vegetation.

3. Test set: This is a completely unseen portion of the data used to evaluate the final model's performance. The context provides two test sets, Test-Zone-1 and Test-Zone-2. However, the specific number of images in these sets is not provided.

In addition to these sets, the context also mentions the use of data augmentation and transfer learning to overcome the limitation of having a large labeled training set. Data augmentation involves creating new training instances by applying transformations like rotation, scaling, and flipping to the existing images. Transfer learning involves using a pre-trained model as a starting point for a new related task, which can help improve the model's performance when the labeled training data is limited.

In summary, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in the provided context are training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to adjust the model's weights, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model's performance. Additionally, data augmentation and transfer learning are used to improve the model's performance when the labeled training data is limited.
