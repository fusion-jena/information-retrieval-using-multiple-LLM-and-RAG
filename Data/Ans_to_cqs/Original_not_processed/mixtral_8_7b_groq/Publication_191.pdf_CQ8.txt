I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include any information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for plant species identification, the optimization capabilities of CNNs, and the number of convolutional layers required for modeling plant data. However, it does not mention where the code for this pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
