I don't have access to the specific deep learning pipeline you are referring to, so I cannot provide the exact data augmentation techniques used in that case. However, I can give you some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning.

Data augmentation is a strategy that enables practitioners to significantly increase the diversity of data available for training models, without actually collecting new data. This is particularly useful in the field of computer vision, where data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used.

1. Flipping: Flipping is a simple data augmentation technique where the image is horizontally or vertically flipped. This helps the model to generalize better, as it can learn that an object remains the same even if its orientation changes.

2. Rotating: Rotating involves rotating the image by a certain angle. This can help the model to recognize objects even if they are not perfectly aligned.

3. Scaling: Scaling involves changing the size of the image. This can help the model to recognize objects at different scales.

4. Translation: Translation involves shifting the image horizontally or vertically. This can help the model to recognize objects even if they are partially outside the image.

5. Color jittering: Color jittering involves randomly changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue of the image. This can help the model to recognize objects under different lighting conditions.

6. MixUp: MixUp is a data augmentation technique where two images and their labels are mixed together to create a new image and a new label. This can help the model to learn smooth decision boundaries and to avoid overfitting.

These techniques can be easily implemented using deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. The specific data augmentation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline would depend on the nature of the problem and the data available.

In the context of the provided pieces of information, there is no direct mention of data augmentation techniques in deep learning pipelines. However, the references do mention the use of various data sources, such as DEM, MODIS data, and road network data, which could be used for data augmentation in a computer vision task related to habitat suitability or wildlife conservation.
