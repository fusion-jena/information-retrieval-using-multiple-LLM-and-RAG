Answer:::

Based on the information provided, there is no mention of a specific code repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The text describes the methodology and process used to assess the transfer learning of CNN regression models, but it does not give any details about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query. It is possible that the code has not been made publicly available, or it may be hosted on a different platform. I would recommend reaching out to the authors or researchers for more information.
