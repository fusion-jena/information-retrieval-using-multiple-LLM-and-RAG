The provided context discusses several studies related to geospatial analysis and remote sensing, particularly using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform for processing satellite imagery. However, the specific methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not directly addressed.

In general, deep learning pipelines for remote sensing and geospatial analysis often rely on processed data from satellite imagery or aerial photography. These images are typically collected using various sensors onboard Earth observation satellites or aircraft. For instance, Landsat, Sentinel-2, and MODIS are common satellite systems that provide multispectral or hyperspectral images, which can be used for various applications, such as land cover classification, object detection, and change detection.

In the context of mangrove forests, several studies have used satellite imagery from Landsat, Sentinel-2, and SPOT satellites to analyze the spatio-temporal dynamics, landscape ecological sensitivity, and individual tree crown delineation. These studies primarily utilized processed surface reflectance products available on the GEE platform.

While the context does not explicitly mention the data collection methods for the raw satellite imagery, it is common knowledge that these images are acquired using passive optical sensors that capture reflected sunlight in various spectral bands. Additionally, active sensors like RADAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) can also be used for remote sensing applications, although these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

In summary, the deep learning pipelines for remote sensing and geospatial analysis typically use processed satellite imagery or aerial photography as raw data. These images are collected using various sensors onboard Earth observation satellites or aircraft. However, the specific data collection methods for the raw satellite imagery are not directly discussed in the provided context.
