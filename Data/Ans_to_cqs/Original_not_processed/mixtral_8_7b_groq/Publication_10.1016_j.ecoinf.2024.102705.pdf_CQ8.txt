Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the description of a study that proposes a compact network with a non-local layer for adaptive image processing in ecological tasks, particularly for camera trap images. It discusses the use of various optimization algorithms and joint training approaches but does not mention any code repository or its location. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to your query.
