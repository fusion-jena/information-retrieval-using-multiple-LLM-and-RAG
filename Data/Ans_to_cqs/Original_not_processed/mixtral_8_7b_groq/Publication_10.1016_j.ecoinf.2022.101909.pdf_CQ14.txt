Based on the provided context, the optimization of the model's hyperparameters is not explicitly mentioned as being performed using a grid search, random search, or any other specific method. However, it is stated that a θ-threshold was searched by class to provide an optimum balance between precision and recall metrics. This was done by observing the highest measure of the harmonic mean (F1score) and the most general measure variations of the Fscore. The β coefficient was decreased down to 0.5 to provide a higher weightage to precision than to recall.

The optimization of the model's hyperparameters was performed by searching for a θ-threshold by class to balance precision and recall metrics.

The β coefficient was adjusted to provide a higher weightage to precision than to recall.
