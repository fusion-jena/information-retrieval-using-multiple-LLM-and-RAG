Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, I can provide some general information about these techniques and why they are important for ensuring the generalizability of a model.

A diverse dataset refers to a dataset that includes a wide range of examples and is representative of the population the model will be used on. Using a diverse dataset can help ensure that the model is able to make accurate predictions for a variety of inputs, rather than just the specific examples it was trained on.

Cross-validation is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a model by dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, or folds, and training and testing the model on each fold. This can help ensure that the model is able to generalize well to new data, as it is trained and tested on a variety of different subsets of the data.

Stratified splitting is a technique used to divide a dataset into training and testing sets in a way that preserves the distribution of important variables. This can be especially important in cases where the dataset is imbalanced, meaning that one class has many more examples than the other. By using stratified splitting, we can ensure that the training and testing sets have a similar distribution of examples from each class, which can help the model generalize better to new data.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, and stratified splitting are all important techniques for ensuring that a model is able to make accurate predictions for a variety of inputs.
