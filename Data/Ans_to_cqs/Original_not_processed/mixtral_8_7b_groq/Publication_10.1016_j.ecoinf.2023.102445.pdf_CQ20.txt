Answer:::
The deep learning model in the paper was trained using a specific experimental platform, which included certain hardware resources. The platform was equipped with an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H processor, which operated at a frequency of 3.20 GHz. The graphics card used was an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Ti laptop GPU, which had a dedicated video memory of 4 GB.

The training of the deep learning model was carried out in the Windows 10 Enterprise operating system. The software environment included Python version 3.7, CUDA version 11.6, and PyTorch deep learning framework version 1.12.0. The CUDA version 11.6 is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API) model created by NVIDIA, which is used for general computing on its own GPUs and TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was trained using the NVIDIA GPU, and possibly with the help of CUDA-enabled TPUs. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of TPUs.
