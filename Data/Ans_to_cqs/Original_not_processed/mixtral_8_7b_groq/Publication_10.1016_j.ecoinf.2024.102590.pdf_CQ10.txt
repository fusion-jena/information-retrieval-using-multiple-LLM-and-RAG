Answer:::
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context mainly discusses the use of deep learning methods for land use and land cover analysis, specifically for mapping woody cover in Kruger National Park (KNP) using aerial images taken every two years. However, it does not mention or provide a link to the code repository used in the study. Therefore, I am unable to fulfill your request with the given information. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.
