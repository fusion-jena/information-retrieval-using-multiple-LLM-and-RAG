Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of a dataset called UGE-D for training a GVI-learning model, but it does not give a specific link to where this dataset can be found or accessed. It also describes the use of the SegFormer deep learning model for semantic segmentation, but again, there is no mention of a data repository link for this model or the pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
