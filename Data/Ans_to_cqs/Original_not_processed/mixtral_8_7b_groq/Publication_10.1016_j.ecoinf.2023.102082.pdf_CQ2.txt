Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline for creating the high-resolution CHM of the Earth (Lang10m) uses optical images from the Sentinel-2 satellite as its primary data format. These images are processed through a convolutional neural network (CNN) to generate the CHM. Therefore, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is specifically images.

It is important to note that the Sentinel-2 images are not the only data format used in the pipeline. Forest density information is also included as an influencing factor in a multiple regression analysis. However, the format of this forest density information is not specified in the context provided.

Additionally, other studies have used passive optical images in machine learning models to extrapolate GEDI samples for continuous information on vegetation structure. These studies suggest that passive optical images can be used in conjunction with GEDI data to improve the accuracy and spatial resolution of CHMs.

In summary, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline for creating Lang10m is Sentinel-2 optical images. However, other data formats such as forest density information and passive optical images may also be used in conjunction with GEDI data to improve the accuracy and spatial resolution of CHMs.
