Based on the provided context, there is no direct mention of any specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch being used in the creation of the model. The text focuses on the process of clustering freshness data for different species using a clustering method, but it does not specify the use of a deep learning framework. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query with certainty based on the given context.
