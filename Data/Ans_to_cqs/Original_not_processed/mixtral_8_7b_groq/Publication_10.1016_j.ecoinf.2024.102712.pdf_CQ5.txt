Based on the provided context, the text does not mention any specific deep learning pipeline or datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention the use of Sentinel-2 data in the context of remote sensing and image processing. Sentinel-2 is a European Space Agency (ESA) Earth observation mission that provides high-resolution optical imagery, which can be used in various applications such as land cover mapping, change detection, and vegetation monitoring.

In addition, the context also mentions the use of QGIS, a free and open-source geographic information system (GIS) software, and the Semi-automatic Classification Plugin (SCP), a Python tool for the download and processing of remote sensing images in QGIS. The SCP plugin can be used to process Sentinel-2 data, among other types of data, for various applications.

It is also mentioned that remote sensing data can be combined with other types of data in an efficient, for example in a model-assisted framework or hierarchical modelling. This suggests that deep learning techniques could potentially be used in conjunction with remote sensing data for various applications.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention any specific deep learning pipeline or datasets, it does mention the use of Sentinel-2 data and QGIS software for remote sensing and image processing. Additionally, it suggests that deep learning techniques could potentially be used in conjunction with remote sensing data for various applications.
