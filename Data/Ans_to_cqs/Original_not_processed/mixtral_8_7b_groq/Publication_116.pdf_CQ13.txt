Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does provide details about the architecture of the model, which includes various layers such as convolution, max pool, batch normalization, LRN (Local Response Normalization), and linear layers. The model also includes inception modules, which are a type of neural network module that allows the model to compute multi-level features. The output sizes, depths, and number of parameters for each layer are also provided.

The context also mentions that batch normalization is used in the model. Batch normalization is a technique used to normalize the activations of the neurons in a layer, which can help improve the training of deep neural networks. It is possible that the model uses some form of adaptive learning rate or optimizer that takes advantage of batch normalization.

In addition, the context mentions that the model is based on the GoogLeNet architecture, which was introduced in the paper "Going deeper with convolutions" by Szegedy et al. This paper does not explicitly mention the learning rate or optimizer used in the model, but it does discuss various techniques used to improve the training of deep neural networks, such as using smaller filter sizes and increasing the depth of the network.

Overall, while the provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the model, it does provide details about the architecture of the model and mentions the use of batch normalization, which may provide some insight into the training process used for the model.
