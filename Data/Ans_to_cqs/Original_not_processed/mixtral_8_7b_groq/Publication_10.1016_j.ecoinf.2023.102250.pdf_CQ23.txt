Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model in terms of diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, there are some details about the techniques used to improve the training stability and performance of the model, such as spectral normalization and dynamic convolutional kernel decomposition.

Spectral normalization is a technique used to enforce Lipschitz continuity on the weight matrices of each layer in the network. This is achieved by constraining the spectral norm of the weight matrix, which helps to limit the upper and lower bounds of the function gradient, making the function smoother, and reducing the likelihood of gradient explosion during optimization. This property contributes to more stable parameter changes and improved training stability of the model. In the context of the DR-ACGAN model, spectral normalization is used in the discriminator instead of batch normalization (BN) to stabilize the training process.

Another technique mentioned in the context is the dynamic convolutional kernel decomposition proposed by Li et al. (2021). This approach effectively reduces the number of parameters in dynamic convolution and improves the classification performance of neural networks that utilize dynamic convolutional kernels. The static convolution kernel can be redefined using the formula Wk = W0 + ΔWk, where k ∈ {1, …, K}, which helps to limit the upper and lower bounds of the function gradient and ensures more stable parameter changes.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information about measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it does mention techniques that contribute to the training stability and performance of the model, such as spectral normalization and dynamic convolutional kernel decomposition.
