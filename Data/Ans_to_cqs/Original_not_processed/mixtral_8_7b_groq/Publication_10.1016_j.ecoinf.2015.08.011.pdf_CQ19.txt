Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the specific frameworks or tools used to build a deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context focuses on the development of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict mosquito abundances based on various factors. It describes the process of determining the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer and the learning rate using a trial-and-error method and an early stopping technique. However, it does not mention any deep learning frameworks or tools. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine which frameworks were used to build the deep learning model.
