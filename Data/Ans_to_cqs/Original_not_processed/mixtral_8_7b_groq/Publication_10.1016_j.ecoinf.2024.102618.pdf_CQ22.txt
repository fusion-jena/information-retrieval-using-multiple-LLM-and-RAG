Answer:::

The performance of the deep learning models in the given work is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall.

Accuracy is a simple metric for deep learning classification models that measures the overall percentage of correct predictions. However, it does not consider the different types of errors. Therefore, other metrics, such as precision and recall, are also used for a more comprehensive evaluation.

Precision is a metric that measures the number of positive predictions that are actually correct, i.e., the ratio of correct positive predictions to the total positive predictions. On the other hand, recall measures the number of positive predictions that are actually correct, i.e., the ratio of correct positive predictions to the total actual positive instances.

The work uses the following formulae to calculate accuracy, precision, and recall:

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)

Precision = TP / (TP + FP)

Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

where TP, TN, FP, and FN represent true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, respectively.

The deep learning models are evaluated using these metrics, and the results are presented in the table. The table shows the accuracy and F1-score for different models, including DenseNet201, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB3, Inceptionresnetv2, ResNet50v2, and various ensembles of these models. The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and provides a single metric that encapsulates both.

The InceptionResNetv2 model has the highest accuracy among the other deep learning models, while ResNet50v2 has the lowest accuracy. The proposed ensemble model with higher accuracy does not include the ResNet50v2 model, indicating its lower performance. The table also shows that some models have an F1-score of 0.999, indicating high precision and recall.

Therefore, the performance of the deep learning models in the given work is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The InceptionResNetv2 model has the highest accuracy, while some models have an F1-score of 0.999, indicating high precision and recall.
