Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The context describes a deep learning pipeline that uses a custom-created and annotated dataset for training. The data for this dataset is collected using a KaKaXi fixed camera, which takes images every hour within a fixed period of time each day. These images are then saved in a database. However, there is no mention of any public data repository where this dataset or the deep learning model's weights and configurations are available.

Therefore, it can be said that the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not publicly available on any of the mentioned repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.

Another possibility is that the data repository is available on the IKKAKU Project website, as mentioned in context [28]. However, there is no explicit mention of the data repository in the provided context.

In summary, the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not publicly available based on the provided context.
