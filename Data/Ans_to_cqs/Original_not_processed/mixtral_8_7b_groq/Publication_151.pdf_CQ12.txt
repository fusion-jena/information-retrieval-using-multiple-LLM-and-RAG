Answer:::
The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is mentioned in the provided context in the Appendix section, where it explains that "a convolutional layer applies a set of parameterized kernels by convolving them across its input." It further explains that "convolutional layers are usually used as feature extractors, and multiple layers are used to detect high-level abstraction from the input." In this specific pipeline, the CNN model is used to train on simulated data sets and then map a given query sequence to a vector of distances. The distances are then used for distance-based placement on the tree. The CNN model is used specifically to enable the model to go beyond traditional i.i.d models of sequence evolution and capture k-mer signatures.

Additionally, the context explains that the first layer of the CNN takes as input L features, each encoded as four channels, and outputs an 8-dimensional vector by applying a kernel size of 1. The next two convolutional layers each have a kernel size of 5, operating on 5-mers. This further supports that a CNN model is being used in the pipeline.
