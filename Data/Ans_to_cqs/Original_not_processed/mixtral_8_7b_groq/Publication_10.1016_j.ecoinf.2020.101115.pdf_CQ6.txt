The provided pieces of context do not contain specific information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. However, they do provide some insights into data handling and management in the context of marine science and fish stock assessment.

In the marine science domain, the Marine Institute's Data Management Quality Framework (Leadbetter et al., 2019) outlines procedures for managing datasets, but it does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps for deep learning models. Similarly, the articles discussing machine intelligence in marine science (Malde et al., 2019), genome annotation (Mao et al., 2005), otolith shape and size (Mapp et al., 2017), and climate-driven synchrony in otoliths (Matta et al., 2010) do not cover the preprocessing of data for deep learning models.

That being said, it is generally acknowledged that preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, and cleaning are crucial in preparing data for deep learning models. These steps help to ensure that the data is in a suitable format for the model to learn effectively, reducing bias and improving model performance.

Normalization and scaling are used to adjust the range of input features so that they have similar scales, which can help the model converge during training and prevent any single feature from dominating the learning process. Common techniques include min-max scaling, which scales features to a range of [0, 1], and standardization, which scales features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Cleaning refers to the process of handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data, which can improve model accuracy and stability.

In summary, while the provided context does not contain specific information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, it is generally accepted that normalization, scaling, and cleaning are important steps in preparing data for deep learning models.
