Answer:::

Deep learning models, including multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), involve randomness in various stages of the pipeline, such as initialization of weights, order of training samples, and dropout regularization. Strategies to handle this randomness include fixing the random seed value and using techniques like cross-validation.

1. **Fixed random seed value**: To ensure reproducibility in deep learning models, it is crucial to set a fixed random seed value. This practice determines the initial random weights and the order of training samples, ensuring that the same model will be trained in every run. The Barhate et al. (2023) paper on plant species identification using a hyperparameter-tuned batch-updated stochastic gradient descent mentions the importance of setting a random seed value for reproducibility.

2. **Cross-validation**: Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a model and reduce overfitting by dividing the dataset into multiple folds. By averaging the performance metrics across these folds, the final model performance becomes more robust and less susceptible to the randomness introduced during the training process.

3. **Dropout regularization**: Deep learning models often employ dropout regularization, a technique that randomly drops out a proportion of neurons during training. This method helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's generalization ability. The randomness introduced by dropout regularization contributes to the model's robustness and adaptability.

In summary, handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline involves setting a fixed random seed value, employing cross-validation techniques, and using dropout regularization. These strategies ensure reproducibility, robustness, and improved generalization in deep learning models.
