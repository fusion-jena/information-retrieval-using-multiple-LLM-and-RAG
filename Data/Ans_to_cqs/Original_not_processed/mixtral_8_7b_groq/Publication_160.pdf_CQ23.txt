Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated which specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, we can infer that several steps were taken to improve the model's ability to generalize.

First, the researchers experimented with different ResNet architectures and input sizes (ResNetX-Y), as shown in Table 3. This allowed them to identify the best-performing model based on the validation and test sets' macro-F1, Top-1 accuracy, and Micro-F1 scores.

Second, they investigated the impact of patch size on the model's performance. They found that a patch size of 224 × 224 pixels resulted in the highest micro-F1 on the test set (65.94). This patch size included enough contextual noise to regularize overfitting and enabled better generalization.

Third, they created an ensemble network based on the four tested patch sizes and followed the feature extraction scheme from Mahmood et al. (2016). Ensemble methods can improve generalization by combining the predictions of multiple models, reducing the risk of overfitting and increasing the robustness of the model.

Lastly, the validation performances consistently increased with the patch size up to 224 × 224, indicating that the model's performance improved as it was exposed to more diverse data. However, macro-F1 was consistently lower than micro-F1, suggesting that the model might have performed better for the majority classes than the minority classes.

In conclusion, while the context does not explicitly mention the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, the researchers took several steps to improve the generalizability of their deep learning model. They experimented with different architectures, patch sizes, and ensemble methods, which likely contributed to the model's ability to generalize.
