Answer:::

The optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam, among others.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular optimization technique used in deep learning. It is an iterative method for minimizing an objective function, which is typically a loss function in the context of deep learning. In SGD, the gradient of the loss function is calculated for a single training example at a time, rather than for the entire training dataset. This makes SGD computationally efficient and suitable for large-scale machine learning problems.

Adam is another optimization technique used in deep learning. It is an adaptive learning rate method that combines the ideas of momentum and adaptive learning rates. In Adam, the learning rate is adjusted dynamically based on the historical gradient information, allowing for faster convergence and better generalization performance.

These optimization techniques are used to train deep learning models by minimizing the loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. The optimization techniques adjust the model parameters to reduce the loss function, iteratively improving the model's performance.

The choice of optimization technique depends on the specific deep learning problem and the characteristics of the training data. For example, SGD may be preferred for simple problems or for problems with large training datasets, while Adam may be preferred for more complex problems or for problems with noisy or non-stationary data.

In summary, optimization techniques such as SGD and Adam are essential components of the deep learning pipeline. They are used to train deep learning models by minimizing the loss function, iteratively adjusting the model parameters to improve the model's performance. The choice of optimization technique depends on the specific deep learning problem and the characteristics of the training data.
