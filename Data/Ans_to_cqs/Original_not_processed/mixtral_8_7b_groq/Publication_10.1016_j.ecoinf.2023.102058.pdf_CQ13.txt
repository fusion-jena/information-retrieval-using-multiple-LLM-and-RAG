Answer:::

The specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the context are not provided. However, I can give you an idea of what hyperparameters are typically used in deep learning models based on the given information.

Deep learning algorithms, such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and extreme machine learning, have been applied to hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters. These models can provide better accuracy and performance using orbital hyperspectral data.

In general, deep learning models have several hyperparameters that can be adjusted to optimize the model's performance. Some common hyperparameters include:

1. Learning rate: This determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. A learning rate that is too small may result in slow convergence, while a learning rate that is too large may result in overshooting the minimum and poor convergence.

2. Optimizer: This is the algorithm used to update the model's weights based on the gradient of the loss function. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.

3. Number of layers and neurons: The architecture of the neural network, including the number of layers and neurons in each layer, can significantly impact the model's performance.

4. Activation function: This function is applied to the output of each neuron to introduce non-linearity into the model. Common activation functions include the rectified linear unit (ReLU), sigmoid, and hyperbolic tangent (tanh).

5. Batch size: This is the number of samples used in each iteration of the optimization algorithm.

6. Number of epochs: This is the number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.

For example, in the study by Maier et al. (2021), they used a deep learning model with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture to estimate chlorophyll-a concentration in inland water bodies. While they do not provide specific details on the hyperparameters used, they mention that they used a dataset of 12,000 water samples and a 10-fold cross-validation scheme.

Therefore, while the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are not provided in the context, these are some common hyperparameters that can be adjusted to optimize the performance of deep learning models for predicting water quality parameters from hyperspectral data.
