The provided context does not contain information about the regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting. The text discusses the evaluation of model performance using leave-one-out cross-validation and the comparison of GEDI data with field data for tree height and Above-Ground Biomass Density (AGBD). It also mentions the use of Sentinel-2 models and various datasets of AGBD and tree heights. However, it does not provide information on the regularization techniques employed in the deep learning pipeline. Regularization methods like dropout, L2 regularization, and others are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model and improving its generalization ability. Without more specific information related to the deep learning pipeline used in this study, it is not possible to provide an accurate answer.
