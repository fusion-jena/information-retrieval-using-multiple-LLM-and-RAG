The provided context discusses the use of remote sensing data and machine learning techniques for bathymetry retrieval, but it does not directly mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does discuss the application of CART (Classification and Regression Tree) and Random Forest Regression (RFR) models in bathymetry retrieval.

In the context of bathymetry retrieval, data annotation techniques may include labeling pixels or regions of interest in remote sensing images with corresponding depth values. This process can be time-consuming and labor-intensive, but it is necessary for training machine learning models to accurately predict bathymetry.

For the CART model used in the study by Sun et al. (2021), the authors preprocessed GF-6 (Gaofen-6) remote sensing data and selected specific model parameters to optimize the regression decision tree. While the context does not explicitly mention data annotation techniques, it can be inferred that some form of data labeling was performed to train the CART model.

Similarly, for the RFR method used in the study by Zhang et al. (2019), the authors employed the SVR (support vector regression) model to provide technical support for bathymetry data in Arctic waters. Again, while the context does not explicitly mention data annotation techniques, it can be inferred that data labeling was performed to train the RFR model.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines can include:

1. Bounding box annotation: Drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in an image.
2. Instance segmentation: Labeling each pixel of an object of interest in an image.
3. Semantic segmentation: Labeling pixels of an image according to their semantic class (e.g., water, land, vegetation).

These techniques require manual annotation by human annotators or automated annotation using pre-trained models. The choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the available data.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, it can be inferred that some form of data labeling was performed to train the CART and RFR models used in bathymetry retrieval. Common data annotation techniques include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.
