The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline for the cellular automaton model. However, it does mention that the model is being modified and improved using machine learning tools and techniques.

In general, deep learning models can handle various data formats such as images, audio, video, and CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific problem and the type of data available.

For instance, in the context of predicting real-world phenomena like wildfire spreads or pest plants propagation, the data format could be raster or vector geospatial data, which represent environmental variables such as temperature, humidity, and wind intensity. These variables can be stored in CSV files or other tabular formats, which can then be processed and analyzed using deep learning algorithms.

In addition, deep learning models can handle time-series data, which can be used to predict the spread of wildfires or pests over time. Time-series data can be stored in various formats, such as CSV files or specialized formats like NetCDF, which is commonly used in geospatial and climate sciences.

Furthermore, deep learning models can also handle unstructured data formats such as images, videos, and audio. For example, satellite or drone images can be used to detect and monitor wildfires or pests. These images can be preprocessed and fed into deep learning models for analysis. Similarly, audio data can be used to detect and monitor wildlife or other environmental sounds, which can be used to detect changes in ecosystems.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline for the cellular automaton model, deep learning models can handle various data formats such as images, audio, video, and CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific problem and the type of data available.
