Answer:::

The criteria used to determine when training is complete for the plant image classification model involves monitoring the validation loss and its tendency to plateau. Training is typically stopped when the validation loss does not decrease significantly over a certain number of epochs, indicating that the model's generalization ability has improved to an acceptable level. This approach helps to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model remembers the training data too well and performs poorly on unseen data.

In the context provided, the two-line graphs in Figure 6 compare the training and validation results over epochs for accuracy and loss. The validation results are represented by the orange color, while the training results are represented by the blue color. The left graph, labeled "Accuracy," measures the percentage of correct predictions made by the model, while the right graph, labeled "Loss," measures the amount of error made by the model.

When training the model, it is crucial to observe the loss graph and look for a point where the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, even if the training loss continues to decrease. This plateau or increase in the validation loss indicates that the model's generalization ability has likely reached its peak, and continuing to train the model may lead to overfitting.

Dropout is used as a technique to help the model reduce the gap between the training and validation results and improve its generalizability. By randomly dropping out a proportion of the model's units during training, dropout helps to prevent over-reliance on specific connections and promotes the development of a more robust and adaptable model.

In summary, the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the plant image classification model involve monitoring the validation loss and looking for a plateau or increase in its value. This approach helps to ensure that the model's generalization ability has improved to an acceptable level and reduces the risk of overfitting.
