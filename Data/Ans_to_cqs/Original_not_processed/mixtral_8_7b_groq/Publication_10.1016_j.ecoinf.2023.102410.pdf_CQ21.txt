Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, the context does provide information about data analysis related to song variant patterns.

Answer:::
Regarding the postprocessing steps involved after model training, the provided context does not contain specific details. However, it is possible to infer some general practices in data analysis based on the information given.

In the context, Table 1 presents the number of tracked vocalizations of each song structure as a proportion of the whole dataset. This information was used to calculate the percentage of tracking samples and detections for each song variant pattern. This step can be considered a part of data analysis or postprocessing, as it involves interpreting and organizing the raw data generated by the model.

In a typical machine learning project, postprocessing steps might include:

1. Metrics calculation: After training a model, it is essential to evaluate its performance using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics can help researchers understand how well the model is performing and identify potential areas for improvement.
2. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model. It can help researchers identify which classes the model is having trouble distinguishing between and provide insights into potential improvements.
3. Saliency maps: Saliency maps are a visualization technique used to highlight the parts of an input that a model considers most important for its prediction. Saliency maps can help researchers understand how the model is making its predictions and identify potential weaknesses or biases.

While the provided context does not mention these specific postprocessing steps, it is possible that they were used in the analysis of the song variant patterns. Without further information, it is impossible to say for sure.
