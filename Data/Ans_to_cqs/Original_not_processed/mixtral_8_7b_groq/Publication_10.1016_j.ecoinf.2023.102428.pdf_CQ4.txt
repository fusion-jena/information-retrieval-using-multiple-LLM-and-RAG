Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the description of the MLPnn-MC model, its components, and the performance results of the model. However, data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's ability to generalize. These techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the context, so it is not possible to provide a specific answer based on the given information.
