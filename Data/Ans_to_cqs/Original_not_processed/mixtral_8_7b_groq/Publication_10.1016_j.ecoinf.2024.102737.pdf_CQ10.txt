Answer:::

 The provided context does not include information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline for bluespotted ribbontail ray (Taeniura Lymma) recognition. The text only mentions that a deep learning-based approach outperforms traditional classification methods in recognizing marine animals, and that preprocessing the input data instead of relying on data augmentation gives better results. However, it does not provide a link to the code repository.
