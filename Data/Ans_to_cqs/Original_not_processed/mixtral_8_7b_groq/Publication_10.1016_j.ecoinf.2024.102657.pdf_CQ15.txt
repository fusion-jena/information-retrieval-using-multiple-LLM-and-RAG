Answer:::
Based on the provided context, no specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or others were mentioned as being applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text does mention that hyperparameters of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) were tuned, but it does not specify how this tuning was done. It is possible that optimization techniques were used during this hyperparameter tuning process, but the specific methods are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
