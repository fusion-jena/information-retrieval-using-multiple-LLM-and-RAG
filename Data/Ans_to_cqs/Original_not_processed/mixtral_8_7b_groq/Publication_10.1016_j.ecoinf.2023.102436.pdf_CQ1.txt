Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are a few methods mentioned for collecting raw data in the context of ecological informatics and deep learning. However, the specific deep learning pipeline is not described in detail.

1. Oblique photogrammetry: Guo et al. (2023) used oblique photogrammetry to construct 3D landscape indexes for islands. Oblique photogrammetry involves capturing images of an object or scene from various angles, which can be used to create 3D models.
2. Convolutional neural network: Qi et al. (2024) used a convolutional neural network to analyze landscape photographs. Convolutional neural networks are a type of deep learning model that are particularly well-suited to image analysis tasks.
3. Public datasets: Akpinar et al. (2016) used public datasets to explore relationships between green space type and health indicators. Public datasets can be a valuable resource for deep learning research, as they often provide large amounts of labeled data.
4. Surveys: Akpinar et al. (2016) also used surveys to collect data on health indicators. Surveys can be a useful method for collecting subjective data that may not be available in public datasets.
5. Sensors: While not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, sensors are commonly used in ecological informatics to collect data on environmental variables. Sensors can provide continuous, real-time data, which can be useful for training deep learning models.

It's worth noting that the specific methods used for data collection will depend on the research question and the available resources. In addition, data preprocessing and augmentation techniques are often used to prepare data for deep learning models. These techniques can include data cleaning, normalization, and the creation of synthetic data.
