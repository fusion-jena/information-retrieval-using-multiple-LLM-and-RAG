Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of data augmentation and dropout as regularization methods to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size and diversity of the training set by applying various transformations to the existing data. In the given context, data augmentation was used to prepare 4000 images for each category by applying methods such as rotation, width and height shift, shear transform, zoom, and horizontal flip. This helped in obtaining a more generalized model by providing fine diversity to the objects, which varied in size, lighting conditions, and poses.

Dropout is another regularization method mentioned in the context, which was used during the training of the EfficientNet model. Specifically, a dropout rate of 0.5 was set for each task. Dropout is a technique in which randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps in preventing overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons.

However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of L2 regularization, which is another common regularization method used to prevent overfitting. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, which can help in preventing overfitting.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline are data augmentation and dropout.
