After training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for audio pattern classification, there are several postprocessing steps that can be involved. Based on the provided context, the following postprocessing steps can be identified:

1. Calculation of Metrics: The performance of the CNN model can be evaluated by calculating various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics can be calculated using the confusion matrix, which is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model.

From the context, a confusion matrix for the first CNN with 5 classes is presented in Table 3. The confusion matrix shows the actual values and the predicted values of the model. From the confusion matrix, we can calculate the accuracy of the model, which is the ratio of the correctly predicted values to the total number of values. In this case, the accuracy of the first CNN is 95.22%.

2. Saliency Maps: Saliency maps can be used to visualize the regions of the input data that are most important for the model's prediction. Saliency maps can be generated by computing the gradient of the model's output with respect to the input data.

The provided context does not mention the use of saliency maps. However, saliency maps can be a useful tool for understanding the decision-making process of the model and identifying any potential biases in the data.

3. Data Augmentation: Although data augmentation is typically performed as a preprocessing step, it can also be used as a postprocessing step to generate new data for further training or testing of the model.

In the provided context, data augmentation is performed as a preprocessing step to generate a more robust training set. For each of the 865 audio samples in the database, 10 additional audios are generated by applying transformations such as rotations, size modifications, etc. These transformations are reflected in the mel-spectrogram images, which are used as input to the CNN model.

In summary, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score using the confusion matrix, and the potential use of data augmentation to generate new data for further training or testing of the model. The use of saliency maps is not mentioned in the provided context.
