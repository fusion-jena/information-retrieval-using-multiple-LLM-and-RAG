Answer:::

Based on the provided context, several preprocessing steps are involved before training a deep learning model. However, the specific steps can vary depending on the type of data and the model used. In the context of training a deep learning model for image classification, such as identifying an invasive vegetation species (Hedychium Coronarium) using U-net, the following preprocessing steps are mentioned:

1. Data collection: The first step is to collect images of the target object or class. In this case, images of Hedychium Coronarium were collected using a DJI Phantom 2 drone with a Global Positioning System (GPS) for accurate image data collection.
