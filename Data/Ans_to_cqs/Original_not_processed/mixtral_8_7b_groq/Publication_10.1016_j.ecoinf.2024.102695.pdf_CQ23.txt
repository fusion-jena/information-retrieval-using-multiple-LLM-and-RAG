Answer:

The generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through a specific data allocation strategy. The dataset was divided chronologically into three sets: 70% for the training set, 10% for the validation set, and 20% for the test set. This strategy better simulates real-world scenarios, as the data in the validation and test sets differ from the training set data. This approach enhances the model's ability to generalize, as it is exposed to data it has not seen during training.

Additionally, an early stopping strategy was employed during the training process. This strategy prevents overfitting by stopping the training before the last epoch if the model's performance on the validation set does not improve. This strategy ensures that the model does not become too specialized to the training data, thereby maintaining its ability to generalize to new data.

However, the text does not mention the use of other common techniques to ensure generalizability, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
