Answer: The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the metrics of Kappa index (KI), Overall accuracy (OA), and Average accuracy (AA) as reported in the study. The Kappa index measures the agreement between the predicted and actual classes, while Overall accuracy represents the proportion of correctly classified samples out of the total. Average accuracy is the mean of the class-wise accuracy, which is the percentage of correctly classified samples for each class. These metrics are used to compare the performance of different models, including Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer (ST), CoAtNet, CNN + ST (ours), GAN + ST (ours), and 3DUNetGSFormer (ours). The study also investigates the impact of data split and image patch size on the final accuracy of wetland mapping, providing insights into the required amount of data and the trade-off between spatial information, classification time, and precise recognition of small objects.
