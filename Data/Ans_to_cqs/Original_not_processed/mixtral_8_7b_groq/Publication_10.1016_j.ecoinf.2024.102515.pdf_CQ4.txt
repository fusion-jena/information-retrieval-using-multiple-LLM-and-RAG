The provided context does not contain information about the specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of the twarc2 library to handle the data retrieved from Twitter's API, and a process of filtering and cleaning the data.

Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, and to improve the model's ability to generalize. Some common data augmentation techniques for image data include flipping, rotating, and scaling. These techniques can help the model learn to recognize features of the images regardless of their orientation or scale.

Flipping refers to horizontally or vertically flipping the image, which can help the model learn to recognize features that are symmetrical or invariant to flipping. Rotating the image can help the model learn to recognize features that are invariant to rotation. Scaling the image can help the model learn to recognize features at different scales.

Other data augmentation techniques that could be used in a deep learning pipeline include cropping, padding, and changing the brightness or contrast of the image. These techniques can help the model learn to recognize features that are invariant to these transformations.

It is important to note that the specific data augmentation techniques used will depend on the nature of the data and the problem being solved. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this question without more context.
