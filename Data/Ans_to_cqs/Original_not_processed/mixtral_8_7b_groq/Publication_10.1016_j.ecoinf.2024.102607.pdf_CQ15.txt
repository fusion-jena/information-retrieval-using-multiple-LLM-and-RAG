Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions the use of Random Forests (RF) classifier, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) algorithms in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) mapping. These algorithms are typically trained using optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSprop.

For instance, the Random Forest classifier is a bagging algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to improve the overall accuracy. It does not require optimization of learning rates or other hyperparameters as in deep learning algorithms.

On the other hand, CNN and DNN are deep learning algorithms that require optimization techniques to adjust the weights and biases during training. These optimization techniques help minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance.

The paper by Davidson et al. (2020) uses the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform and neural networks for crop mapping in Canada. However, it does not provide details about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Similarly, the paper by Inglada et al. (2015) assesses an operational system for crop type map production using high temporal and spatial resolution satellite optical imagery. They use a Random Forest classifier, but they do not mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that deep learning algorithms such as CNN and DNN are used in LULC mapping. These algorithms typically require optimization techniques such as SGD, Adam, or RMSprop to adjust the weights and biases during training.
