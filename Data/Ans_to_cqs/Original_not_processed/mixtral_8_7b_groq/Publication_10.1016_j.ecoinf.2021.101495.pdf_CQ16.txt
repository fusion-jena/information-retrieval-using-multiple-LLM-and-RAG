Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the neural networks. However, it does mention that manual tuning was used in the training process, which could include setting a threshold for validation loss or other performance metrics to decide when to stop training.

In addition, the context states that the training duration for segmentation was 4 hours, 6 minutes, and 24 seconds, while the training duration for classification was 9 hours, 22 minutes, and 34 seconds. These durations suggest that the training process was run for a fixed amount of time, rather than stopping based on a specific condition being met.

It's also worth noting that the training set was improved by adding artifacts, which resulted in a higher accuracy of 54.50%. This improvement in the training set may have contributed to the training process reaching convergence more quickly or effectively.

Overall, while the specific criteria for determining training completion are not provided in the context, it's possible that manual tuning and fixed training durations were used to evaluate the performance of the neural networks.
