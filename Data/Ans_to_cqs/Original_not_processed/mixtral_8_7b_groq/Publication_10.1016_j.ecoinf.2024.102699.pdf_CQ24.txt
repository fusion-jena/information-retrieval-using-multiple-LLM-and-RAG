Answer:::

The provided context discusses various topics related to deep learning, data augmentation techniques, and bird species classification. However, it does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value.

In general, deep learning frameworks and libraries often include mechanisms to handle randomness. These can be divided into two categories: global and local randomness control. Global randomness control is typically managed using a fixed seed value for the entire computation graph, ensuring reproducibility of results across different runs. Local randomness control, on the other hand, is used for operations like dropout, weight initialization, or data shuffling, where introducing randomness can help improve model performance and prevent overfitting.

For instance, in the paper "Adam: A method for stochastic optimization" by Kingma and Ba (2015), the authors propose a method for stochastic optimization that adapts the learning rate for each parameter. This method involves generating randomness during the optimization process, but the overall reproducibility of the results can still be controlled using a fixed seed value for the random number generator.

In the context of the bird species classification task, the authors of "Bird sound classification using convolutional neural networks" by Koh et al. (2019) mention the use of data augmentation techniques to improve both accuracy and generalizability of their models. While these techniques involve introducing randomness during data preprocessing, the use of a fixed seed value can ensure consistent results across different runs.

In summary, while the provided context does not specifically mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, deep learning frameworks and libraries typically provide mechanisms for controlling both global and local randomness. These include using a fixed seed value for the computation graph and managing randomness during specific operations like dropout and weight initialization.
