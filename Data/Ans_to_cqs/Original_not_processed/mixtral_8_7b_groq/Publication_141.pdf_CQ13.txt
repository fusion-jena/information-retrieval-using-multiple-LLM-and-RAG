Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are the learning rate and the optimizer, although the context does not provide specific values for these hyperparameters. The model is trained using a two-stage process, where a top classifier (fully connected layer) is trained in the first stage based on features extracted from processing images with a pretrained convolutional part of the network. In the second stage, the network is trained as a whole in a fine-tuned manner using smaller learning rates. Data augmentation and dropout techniques were applied to enhance model robustness.

The CNN classifier was implemented in Python using the Keras deep learning library and TensorFlow with GPU execution as the back-end engine. The regions of the images most informative for the decision-making process in the deep learning model were visualized using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which generated heatmaps indicating important aspects of each head capsule used to determine the taxonomic decision-making process of the model.

The model was trained on a dataset of chironomid taxa, where 80% of the image data was used for training and the remaining 20% were used for validation. The 80:20 split of the image data was carried out per category (chironomid taxa), where each fifth image was chosen for the validation dataset.

Overall, while the context provides details on the model architecture, training process, and implementation, it does not specify the values of the learning rate and optimizer used in the deep learning model.
