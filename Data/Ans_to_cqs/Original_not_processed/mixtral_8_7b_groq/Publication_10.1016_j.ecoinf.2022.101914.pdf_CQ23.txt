Answer:::

The generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through a combination of techniques, including cross-validation, data splitting, and the evaluation of individual modeling approaches. 

Firstly, the data was split into training and evaluation datasets prior to training the models. This was done to ensure that all models were evaluated with the same relatively independent data. The evaluation dataset was set aside and used to evaluate individual averaged modeling approaches and the final ensemble models. 

Secondly, to obtain presences and background points to use during external evaluation, one fold was set aside. The remaining four folds were used for internal cross-validation during model training. This method, known as k-fold cross-validation, is a powerful preventative measure against overfitting. It ensures that the model is tested on data that it has never seen before, thereby providing a more realistic estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.

Thirdly, to assess the optimal number of background points for each individual modeling approach, the True Skill Statistic (TSS) and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Curve (AUC-ROC) were calculated for each model using the external evaluation datasets. These measures provide a robust evaluation of the model's performance, particularly in imbalanced datasets, which are common in ecological problems.

Lastly, the text mentions that the decisions made during the modeling process demand careful consideration in the full context of the question at hand, since different questions often differ in their requirements from a model. This suggests that the researchers were aware of the importance of tailoring the model to the specific requirements of the problem at hand, which is another crucial aspect of ensuring the model's generalizability.

Therefore, the generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through a combination of data splitting, cross-validation, robust evaluation measures, and careful consideration of the problem's specific requirements.
