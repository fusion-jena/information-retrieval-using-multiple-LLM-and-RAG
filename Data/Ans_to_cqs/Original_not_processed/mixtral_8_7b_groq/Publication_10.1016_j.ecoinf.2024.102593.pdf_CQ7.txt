Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training typically include a train set, a validation set, and a test set. Although the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria for splitting the data, it does give some insight into the data preparation process for deep learning model training.

The NIPS4Bplus dataset and the BirdCLEF 2020 dataset are used for training deep learning models. In the case of NIPS4Bplus, the rich labels associated with the dataset are utilized for training. Meanwhile, for BirdCLEF 2
