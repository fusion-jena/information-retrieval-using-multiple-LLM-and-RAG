Based on the provided context, there is no specific information given about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, the context does provide some insights on the image segmentation and classification process in eCognition, which involves the use of various image bands, topographic variables, and machine learning techniques.

In the segmentation and classification process, different bands and image properties are used to segment and classify images. For example, for 2009 NAIP images, NDVI, mean values of different bands (e.g., green, infrared), overall image brightness, and per-pixel texture variables are used. For historical imagery, image brightness, contrast, homogeneity, dissimilarity, and second moment are used. Topographic variables, such as slope, aspect, elevation, curvature, solar radiation, and topographic wetness index, are also used to predict vegetation characteristics.

Machine learning techniques are being brought together with segmentation to more automatically classify images. However, even with machine learning, some supervision and validation using aerial photo interpretation techniques or other data sources are still necessary.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete, it can be inferred that the training process involves the use of various image bands, topographic variables, and machine learning techniques, and that some level of supervision and validation is required.
