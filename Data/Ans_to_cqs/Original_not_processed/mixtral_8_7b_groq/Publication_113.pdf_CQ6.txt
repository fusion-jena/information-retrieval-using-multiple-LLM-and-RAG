Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of active learning algorithms for training deep learning models, but it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it is common practice to perform certain preprocessing steps on the data before training a deep learning model. These steps can include normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

Normalization is the process of scaling numeric columns in the dataset to a common range, often between 0 and 1. This is important for deep learning models because the weights in the model are initialized with small values, and if the input data is not normalized, the gradients during backpropagation can be very small or very large, causing slow convergence or numerical instability.

Scaling is similar to normalization, but it involves scaling the data to a specific range or standard deviation. This is often done when working with tree-based models or when the data has a natural scale (e.g., dates, counts).

Cleaning the data involves removing or correcting erroneous or missing values in the dataset. This is important because deep learning models are sensitive to the quality of the data and can produce poor results if the data is not clean.

In addition to these preprocessing steps, it is also common to perform feature engineering on the data before training a deep learning model. This can involve creating new features from existing ones, such as polynomial features or interaction terms, or extracting features from raw data, such as image or text data.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention these preprocessing steps, it is common practice to perform normalization, scaling, and cleaning on the data before training a deep learning model.
