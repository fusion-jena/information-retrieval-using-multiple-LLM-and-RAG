Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the training and evaluation of the model, including the use of k-fold cross-validation, the Python library scikit-learn, and the investigation of YOLO training losses and mAP50 values. It also mentions the computation time of 3.4 hours. However, it does not give any information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
