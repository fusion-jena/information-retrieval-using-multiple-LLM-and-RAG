Answer:::

The hyperparameters of the model, referred to as "parameters" in the provided context, are optimized using the Shuffle Complex Evolution method. This method fits the parameters by maximizing the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) as the objective function. The NSE measures the performance of the model by comparing the sum of squared residuals of the model's predictions to the sum of squared residuals of the sample mean as a predictor. An NSE of 1 indicates a perfect fit, while a value less than 0 indicates that the model performs worse than using the sample mean. Alternatively, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) can be used as the objective function, which will return comparable results to NSE.

It is important to note that when using RMSE as a metric to evaluate model performance, the statistic must be viewed in the context of the magnitude of model outputs. The FERM model was calibrated on daily timestep LAI outputs taken from the WAVES water and energy balance model for Eucalyptus largiflorens (Black Box) from 1949 to 2018 at three grid cells at different distances from the river.

Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was performed on FERM using Sobol Sensitivity Analysis to assess the sensitivity of the output to parameter choice. Sobol sensitivity analysis, also known as global sensitivity analysis, is a variance-based method that quantifies the importance of each parameter by measuring the contribution of each parameter to the variance of the output. This method allows for the identification of the most influential parameters and provides insights into the robustness and uncertainty of the model.

In summary, the hyperparameters of the FERM model are optimized using the Shuffle Complex Evolution method by maximizing the NSE or RMSE as the objective function. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted using Sobol sensitivity analysis to assess the sensitivity of the output to parameter choice.
