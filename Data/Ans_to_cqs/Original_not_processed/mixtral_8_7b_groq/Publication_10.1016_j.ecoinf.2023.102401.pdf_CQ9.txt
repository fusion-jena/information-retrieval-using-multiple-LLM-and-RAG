Answer:::
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the description of several datasets used to test a model called YWnet, as well as some details about the model's architecture. However, it does not mention where the data or code for the pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
