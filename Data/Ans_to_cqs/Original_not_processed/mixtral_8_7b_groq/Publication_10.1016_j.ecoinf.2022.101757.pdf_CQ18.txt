Answer:

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the model was evaluated using R2 values and scatter plots. Specifically, R2 values were calculated for the metrics considered, and scatter plots were used to visualize the relationship between the metrics and the measured distances. These evaluations were conducted after the model was trained, rather than during the training process.

Furthermore, the study mentioned that larger R2 values were found when considering L < 500, indicating that the model's performance was better for smaller datasets. This information suggests that the model's performance was evaluated based on the size of the dataset used for training.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, it can be inferred that the model's performance was evaluated using R2 values and scatter plots after training. Additionally, the study evaluated the model's performance based on the size of the dataset used for training.
