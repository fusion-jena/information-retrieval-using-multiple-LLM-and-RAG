Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model after it was created using the MLPnn-MC (MLP neural network-Markov chain) model. However, it does provide information about the model creation process.

The MLPnn-MC model integrates the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm and Markov chain to create a robust future land-use and land-cover (LULC) simulation. The MLP algorithm is a prevalent machine learning algorithm in artificial neural network (ANN) modeling, which uses backpropagation or the reverse method of automatic learning. This model utilizes deep machine learning to learn the model in automated mode in less calibration time through complex, multivariate, and non-linear relationships. It creates several transitions and predicts unseen data within the model at a single time by comprehending the hidden relationships.

Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the model was created using the MLPnn-MC model with specific parameters such as input layer neurons, hidden layer nodes, output layer neurons, requested samples per class, start learning rate, end learning rate, momentum factor, sigmoid constant, iterations, acceptable RMS, training RMS, testing RMS, accuracy rate, and skill measure. However, the context does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed or any details about model serialization or platform selection.
