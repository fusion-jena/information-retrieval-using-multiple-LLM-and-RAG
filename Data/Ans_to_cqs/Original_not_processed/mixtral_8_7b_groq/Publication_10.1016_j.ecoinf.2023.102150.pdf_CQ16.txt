Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in this particular study. However, it is common practice in machine learning to consider training complete when the validation loss plateaus or starts to decrease very slowly. This indicates that the model has learned most of the relevant patterns in the training data and further training is unlikely to significantly improve its performance. Additionally, avoiding overfitting is a crucial consideration in model training. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. To prevent overfitting, the model training process often includes a validation step, where the model's performance is evaluated on a separate validation dataset. If the validation loss starts to increase while the training loss continues to decrease, this is a sign of overfitting, and training should be stopped. It is also important to note that the context highlights the importance of model retraining with new images, especially for rare classes, to improve model performance and prevent overestimation or underestimation of true positives, false positives, and false negatives.
