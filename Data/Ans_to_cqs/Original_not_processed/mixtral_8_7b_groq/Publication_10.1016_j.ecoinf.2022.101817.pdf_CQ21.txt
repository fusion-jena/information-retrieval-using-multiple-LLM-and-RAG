Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix.

In the study conducted by Soom et al., they trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify six different environmental conditions. After training the model, they calculated the validation performance of the model with respect to each of the six environmental conditions. This was presented in the form of a confusion matrix in Figure 7(b) of the study.

A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It compares the actual values (also known as the ground truth) with the predicted values from the model. The matrix shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. From these values, various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score can be calculated.

However, the context does not mention any other postprocessing steps such as the creation of saliency maps. Saliency maps are a way to visualize the parts of an input that are most important for the model's prediction. It highlights the areas of the input that the model is focusing on when making its prediction.

In summary, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics and the creation of a confusion matrix. Other postprocessing steps such as the creation of saliency maps are not mentioned.
