Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model for age estimation of pandas are Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Cumulative Score (CS). Accuracy, which is a common evaluation metric for many classification tasks, is not an effective measurement for age estimation tasks.

The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is defined as the average of the absolute differences between the true ages (yi) and the predicted ages (̂yi) of the pandas in the dataset, where N is the number of images. The MAE gives an idea of how far the predictions are from the actual values on average.

The Cumulative Score (CS) is defined as the number of images (NI) for which the absolute difference between the true age and the predicted age is less than a threshold distance (I) in years, divided by the total number of images (N). In this study, the threshold distance (I) was set to 3 years. The CS gives an idea of the proportion of predictions that are within a certain distance from the actual values.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of seven deep learning models from four types of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) including ResNet-18, ResNet-50, RepVGG-A0, RepVGG-A1, and others. The models were evaluated based on their ability to estimate the ages of pandas using a dataset of 40,010 images. The results were reported in the form of mean value ± standard deviation.
