Unfortunately, based on the provided context, there is no information about a code repository for a deep learning pipeline. The context includes several studies and papers related to the use of machine learning, remote sensing, and geographic data, but none of them mention a code repository or provide a link to one.

It is possible that the authors of these studies have made their code available on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, but the context does not provide enough information to determine this. If you are interested in a specific study or paper mentioned in the context, I would recommend reaching out to the authors directly to inquire about the availability of their code.

In general, many researchers make their code available on public repositories to promote transparency and reproducibility of their research. If you are looking for code related to deep learning pipelines for remote sensing or geographic data, you may want to search for repositories on platforms like GitHub or Google Scholar using relevant keywords such as "deep learning," "remote sensing," "geographic data," "LiDAR," "hyperspectral," or "UAV." This may help you find relevant code repositories that you can use or adapt for your own research.
