Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is commonly used to update the weights, which suggests that the training process involves iterative computations that can be accelerated with specialized hardware.

In general, deep learning models like ResNet and GoogLeNet are trained using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to speed up the computations. GPUs are specialized hardware designed for parallel processing of large datasets, making them suitable for training deep learning models. TPUs, on the other hand, are custom-built by Google for machine learning tasks and can deliver higher performance than GPUs for certain workloads.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the training of the deep learning model in the given context was performed using either GPUs or TPUs. However, the specific hardware used is not mentioned in the provided context.
