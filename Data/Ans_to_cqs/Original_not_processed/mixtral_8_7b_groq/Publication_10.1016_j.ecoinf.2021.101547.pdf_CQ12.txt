Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the described pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is specified in the context when it mentions that the foundation of their CNN for detecting polar bears is the freely available residual network ResNet-50, which is a well-known CNN architecture. The authors used this pre-trained network, which has been trained on over 1 million images from the ImageNet database, and modified it for their specific task of detecting polar bears. They replaced the last learnable layer with a custom learnable layer defining the two classes of interest and replaced the final classification layer with a custom weighted classification layer. The computations for training and image classification operations were processed on a GeForce RTX 2070 Super graphics processing unit (GPU), which is a common practice when working with deep learning models.
