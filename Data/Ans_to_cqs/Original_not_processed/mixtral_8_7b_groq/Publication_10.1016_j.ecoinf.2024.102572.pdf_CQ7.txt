Based on the provided context, there is not enough information to determine the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context discusses various processes and methods used for data collection and preprocessing, particularly in the context of forest fires and land use in mainland China and Florida, USA. However, it does not mention any details about the data splitting process for deep learning model training. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.
