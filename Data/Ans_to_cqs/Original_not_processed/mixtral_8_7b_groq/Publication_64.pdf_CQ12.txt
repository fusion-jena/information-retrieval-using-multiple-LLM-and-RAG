Answer:::

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the ResNet50 architecture is used, which is a stack of residual blocks, each containing a series of convolutional layers. The innovation of ResNet50 is the addition of an identity mapping path that connects the output of a block to its own input, alleviating the vanishing gradient problem and improving the flow of gradients backward in the network. This allows for the training of much deeper networks.

The ResNet50 model is trained for 100 epochs on a GTX 1080 for 6 days using the Adam learning rule. During training, standard data augmentation techniques such as sheer, translation, and mirror are applied, but rotation and upside-down mirroring are not applied to images tagged as 'habit' to maintain their orientation. After applying the transformations, the images are downscaled to the ResNet standard input size of 224x224.

The choice of using a CNN for plant classification is based on the assumption that top-performing architectures in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) would perform well in this task. The ILSVRC is a standardized image classification task that allows for the comparison of top-performing architectures.

In summary, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the ResNet50 architecture.
