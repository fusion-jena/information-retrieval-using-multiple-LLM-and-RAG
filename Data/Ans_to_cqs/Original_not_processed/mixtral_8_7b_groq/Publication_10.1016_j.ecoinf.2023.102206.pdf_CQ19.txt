Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the deep learning frameworks used in the study. However, it mentions that deep learning is employed to transform the source domain dataset using a small sample of the target domain as seed. Therefore, it can be inferred that the researchers might have used any of the popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, or Theano to build their deep learning model. Without more specific details, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
