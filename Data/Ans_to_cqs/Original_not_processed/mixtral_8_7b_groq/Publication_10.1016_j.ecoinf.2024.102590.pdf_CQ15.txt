Based on the provided context, the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. The text focuses on the use of aerial images for land use and land cover (LULC) analysis, specifically for mapping woody cover in the Kruger National Park (KNP) using a Random Forest classifier and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) texture metrics.

The deep learning method referred to in the context is likely Jagannathan and Divya (2021), but the specific deep learning pipeline, optimization techniques, or algorithms are not discussed. Deep learning pipelines often use optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), or others to update model weights during training. However, these techniques are not mentioned in the given text.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query based on the provided context.
