Answer:::
In the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that deep learning has been successful in extracting information from camera trap images. Commonly used datasets in deep learning include MNIST for handwritten digit recognition, CIFAR for object recognition, and ImageNet for large-scale image recognition. In the context of camera trap images, the datasets used could be specific to this domain and might include various species, counts, and behaviors. It is also possible that the authors have created their own dataset for this study. Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer regarding the specific datasets used in this deep learning pipeline.
