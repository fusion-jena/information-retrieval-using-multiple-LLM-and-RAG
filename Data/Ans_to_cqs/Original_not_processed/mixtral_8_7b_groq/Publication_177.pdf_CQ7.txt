Answer:::

In the context provided, the data was split for deep learning model training using specific percentages. The original dataset was divided, with 60% used for training, 20% for validation, and 20% for testing. This approach allows for the development and comparison of models using separate datasets, preventing overfitting and ensuring the model's ability to generalize.

Before the split, 40% of the images were reserved for testing. Of this 40%, half was allocated for validation (20% of the total dataset), and the other half was used for testing (the remaining 20%). The training dataset, therefore, consisted of the remaining 60% of the images.

This method of splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets is a common practice in deep learning. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and monitor the model's performance during training, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

The specific criteria for splitting the data in this context are based on percentages, with a 60-20-20 split between training, validation, and testing, respectively. This approach ensures a sufficient amount of data for each stage of the model's development and evaluation, providing a robust and reliable model.
