Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about a specific code repository for a deep learning pipeline. The context consists mainly of research papers and books about machine learning, soil science, and spatial sampling, but none of them mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository.

However, the paper "Machine learning for predicting soil classes in three semi-arid landscapes" does mention the use of machine learning algorithms for predicting soil classes. The paper uses Random Forest, a bagging algorithm, to predict soil classes based on environmental variables. The paper also mentions the importance of addressing biased model training and validation, which is relevant to the development of a deep learning pipeline.

Furthermore, the book "Spatial Sampling with R" by Brus (2023) provides code examples for various spatial sampling methods in R. Although the book does not focus on deep learning, it may still be a useful resource for developing a deep learning pipeline, particularly for the spatial sampling component.

In summary, while there is no specific code repository for a deep learning pipeline mentioned in the provided context, the context does provide relevant information on machine learning algorithms, biased model training, and spatial sampling. The paper "Machine learning for predicting soil classes in three semi-arid landscapes" and the book "Spatial Sampling with R" may be useful resources for developing a deep learning pipeline.
