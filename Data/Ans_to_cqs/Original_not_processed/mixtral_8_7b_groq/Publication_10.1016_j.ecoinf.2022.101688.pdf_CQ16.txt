Answer:::

The text provided does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that several experiments were conducted to assess the use of transfer learning in creating binary classification models. In the context of machine learning and deep learning, training is often stopped when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing, or when the model begins to overfit the training data. These are common criteria used to determine when training should be stopped to prevent the model from learning too much from the training data and performing poorly on unseen data. Additionally, the number of unique executions (13) suggests that cross-validation may have been used, which involves dividing the data into multiple folds, training the model on some folds and validating it on others, and averaging the results to get a more robust estimate of the model's performance. However, the text does not explicitly state whether cross-validation was used or what specific criteria were used to determine when training was complete.
