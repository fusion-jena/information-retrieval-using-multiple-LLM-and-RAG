Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The articles by Chen et al. (2024) discuss the use of the DeepLabV3+ model for ecological informatics, but they do not mention or provide a link to a data repository for the pipeline. It is possible that the data used in the study was not made publicly available, or it could be hosted on a different platform not mentioned in the provided context. If you are interested in accessing the data, I would recommend contacting the authors directly for more information.
