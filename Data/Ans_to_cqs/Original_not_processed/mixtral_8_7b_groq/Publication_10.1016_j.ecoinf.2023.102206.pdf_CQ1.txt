The provided context does not directly answer the query regarding the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some types of data that are used in various studies, which can give us an idea of the possible data collection methods.

In the study related to air quality and CO2 emissions, the authors model the concentration and toxicity levels using Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets (IT2 FSs). This suggests that they might have used sensors or monitoring systems to collect data on air quality parameters such as CO2 concentration, temperature, humidity, and other pollutants.

In another study related to pig farming, the authors use acoustic data and deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify oestrus and non-oestrus sounds of sows. This implies that they might have used microphones or sound sensors to collect the acoustic data.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of public datasets such as the Brodatz texture dataset, Intel Berkeley dataset, de Montfort university robotics dataset, and robotics laboratory data. These datasets are likely to be collected through collaborative efforts of researchers and institutions.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can infer that the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline include sensors, monitoring systems, surveys, and public datasets. Sensors and monitoring systems are used to collect real-time data on physical phenomena, while surveys are used to collect data on subjective experiences and opinions. Public datasets are useful for training and testing deep learning models on a wide variety of tasks and domains.
