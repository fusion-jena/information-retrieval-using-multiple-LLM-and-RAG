The provided context does not directly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss data acquisition and processing in the context of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) and data mining.

In the KDD process, the first step is identifying the aim for a specific study area. This involves determining the objectives and scope of the study, which would include identifying the type of data needed and the sources from which to collect it.

The context mentions the use of "analytical determinations for the detection of PPPs (plant protection products) in Puglia surface water bodies" as part of the KDD process. This suggests the use of analytical techniques, such as chemical analysis, for collecting raw data.

In addition, the context discusses the use of "big spatiotemporal data" in the KDD process. This suggests the use of sensors or other devices that collect data over space and time.

Furthermore, the context mentions the possibility of using public datasets in the data mining process. This is mentioned in the context of implementing an automatic elaboration workflow with open-source software.

In summary, based on the provided context, the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline may include analytical techniques, sensors or other devices that collect data over space and time, and public datasets. However, the context does not provide specific details on the use of surveys for data collection.
