Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the authors proposed two deep learning models for fish detection in turbid waters using a weakly labeled public FishInTurbidWater dataset. However, the text does not explicitly mention the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models.

However, we can infer some strategies from the information given:

1. Diverse dataset: The authors used a weakly labeled public FishInTurbidWater dataset, which likely contains diverse underwater scenes with varying turbidity levels, fish species, and sizes. Using such a diverse dataset can help improve the model's generalizability.
2. Proposing two models: The authors proposed two different models, an ensemble of a decision tree and an ensemble of the two independent models. This approach might help improve generalizability, as different models can capture different patterns and relationships in the data.
3. Evaluation on labeled frames: The authors evaluated their models on labeled frames, which could provide a more accurate assessment of the models' performance compared to using unlabeled frames.

While these inferred strategies might contribute to the generalizability of the models, the text does not explicitly mention other common techniques, such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or data augmentation. Therefore, it is unclear if these methods were employed.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models, some strategies can be inferred from the provided context. However, it is not possible to definitively answer this question without additional information.
