The text provided does not give a detailed description of the data preprocessing steps taken to address data bias. However, it does mention that the authors addressed "data acquisition and preprocessing of acquired dataset to overcome imbalanced and data overfitting" in Section II of their paper.

One common technique to address data imbalance is through oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class. Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that guarantees each subset (e.g., each class in a classification problem) is represented proportionally in the sample. Diverse data collection is another approach to address data bias, where the data is collected in such a way that it represents the true distribution of the population.

Without further information, it is not possible to say for certain which techniques were used in this specific case. However, the authors do mention that they augmented the training dataset 10 times, resulting in a total of 31,320 images. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of a dataset by creating modified versions of the images in the dataset. This can help to improve the model's ability to generalize and reduce overfitting.

In summary, while the text provides some information about the data preprocessing steps taken, it does not give specific details about the techniques used to address data bias. It is possible that the authors used oversampling, undersampling, or stratified sampling, but this is not explicitly stated. They do mention data augmentation as a method used to increase the size of the training dataset.
