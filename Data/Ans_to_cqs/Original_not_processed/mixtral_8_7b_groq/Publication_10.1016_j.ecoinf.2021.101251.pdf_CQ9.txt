Based on the provided context, there is no specific mention of a "deep learning pipeline" or its data repository. However, it does provide some information about data repositories and how they are used in the context of scientific data sharing.

ESS-DIVE is a data repository that enables advanced search of data across data packages and retrieval of specific data found through a user's search query. The data packages in ESS-DIVE are submitted by projects funded under the ESS program for long-term stewardship. Examples of such projects include AmeriFlux, WFSFA, and NGEE-Tropics.

The context also mentions that data consumers are able to incorporate data from many data packages into an analysis, but properly citing the data in the reference section can be difficult when a large number of data packages have been used. In such cases, a solution would be to provide a single citation that can enumerate the exact subset of the data retrieved from the repository.

Therefore, if the "deep learning pipeline" data is submitted to ESS-DIVE or any other data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, it would be available in that repository. To find the data, one could search for the project or data package name in the repository's search function. Proper citation of the data would depend on the repository's citation guidelines and the specific data package's citation requirements.

Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the data repository of the "deep learning pipeline" is not explicitly mentioned. However, data repositories such as ESS-DIVE, Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF are possible locations for the data. To find the data, one could search for the project or data package name in the repository's search function. Proper citation of the data would depend on the repository's citation guidelines and the specific data package's citation requirements.
