Based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific purpose of a deep learning model, such as classification, segmentation, or detection. The context discusses the use of machine learning models, including XGB, RF, and ET, for water quality prediction. It also mentions the use of hyperparameter tuning and a stacking-based ANN meta ML model. However, there is no mention of a deep learning model or its specific purpose. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
