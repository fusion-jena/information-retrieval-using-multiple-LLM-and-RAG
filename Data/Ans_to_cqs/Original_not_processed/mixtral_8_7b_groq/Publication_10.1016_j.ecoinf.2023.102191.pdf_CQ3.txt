Based on the provided context, the text does not mention any specific deep learning pipeline or data annotation techniques used for annotating data in a machine learning model. The text discusses a study about a mobile app that collects data on marine life sightings from citizen scientists and dive guides. The data collected includes the frequency and abundance of specific marine taxa, as well as metadata on location, number of dives, and number of divers. However, it does not mention any details about the use of deep learning or data annotation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
