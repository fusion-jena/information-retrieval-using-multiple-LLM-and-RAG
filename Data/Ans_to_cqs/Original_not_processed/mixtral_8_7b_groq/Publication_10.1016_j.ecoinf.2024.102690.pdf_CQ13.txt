Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the text does not discuss a deep learning model in the traditional sense of neural networks with many layers. Instead, it describes the use of a Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) neural network, which is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis.

The SOFM algorithm used in this study has some hyperparameters, but they are not the typical learning rate or optimizer found in deep learning models. Instead, the SOFM has parameters related to its topographic map structure, such as the number of nodes and the neighborhood function's shape (α, β, and γ indices). These parameters control how the input scenario's topological relationships are preserved in the output map.

The SOFM algorithm is combined with traditional Ecological Service Provision (ESP) construction paradigms, which focus on the capacity of different regions to provide dominant ESs. This combination aims to provide a new idea for the construction and optimization of ESPs.

In summary, the SOFM neural network used in this study has hyperparameters related to its topographic map structure (α, β, and γ indices) and the number of nodes. However, it does not have typical deep learning hyperparameters like a learning rate or optimizer.
