Answer:::

The text provided does not give specific information about all the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. However, it does provide some details about other hyperparameters.

The model was trained with a batch size of 64 and a resolution of 704 Ã— 704. The authors used 32 subdivisions and trained the model for up to 6000 iterations. The training process involved cycles of training on the training set, evaluating performance on the validation set, and adjusting the CNN node weights. The optimum number of iterations was sought to avoid overfitting, i.e., to find the point where the performance on the validation and training sets was best.

The model's predictions were recorded in a .JSON file, which included the coordinates of the bounding box of each tentative annotation and a confidence score ranging from 0.05 to 1. During testing, every object detected with a confidence value >0.05 was recorded, allowing for the application of higher confidence thresholds later. Performances were calculated with confidence thresholds of 0.05, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.9 to select the threshold that maximized the true positives (TP) while keeping false positives (FP) to a reasonable level.

In summary, while the text does not provide specific information about the learning rate and the optimizer used in the deep learning model, it does mention the batch size, resolution, number of subdivisions, and the number of iterations. Additionally, it provides details about the confidence thresholds used during testing.
