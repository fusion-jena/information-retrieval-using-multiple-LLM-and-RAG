Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of automated machine learning (AutoML) and specific techniques related to it, but it does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that AutoML can be used with various data formats depending on the problem at hand.

In general, deep learning models can handle different types of data formats such as images, audio, video, and structured data like CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific problem and the nature of the data available.

For instance, in the context of image data, deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for image classification, object detection, and segmentation tasks. These models require image data to be preprocessed and formatted in a specific way, such as resizing images to a consistent size and normalizing pixel values.

Similarly, for audio data, deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are used for speech recognition, music generation, and other audio-related tasks. These models require audio data to be preprocessed and formatted as time-series data or spectrograms.

For video data, deep learning models like 3D CNNs and CNN-LSTM networks are used for video classification, object detection, and action recognition tasks. These models require video data to be preprocessed and formatted as a sequence of frames or clips.

Finally, for structured data like CSV files, deep learning models like Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), CNNs, and RNNs can be used for regression, classification, and time-series forecasting tasks. These models require data to be preprocessed and formatted as a table or matrix.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that AutoML can be used with various data formats depending on the problem and the nature of the data available. Deep learning models can handle different types of data formats such as images, audio, video, and structured data like CSV files.
