The provided context does not contain information about deep learning model preprocessing steps. However, in general, preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model can include:

1. Data cleaning: This involves removing or correcting erroneous, missing, or irrelevant data points to improve data quality.
2. Data scaling: This is the process of resizing the range of independent variables so that all features have similar scales. Common techniques include standardization (zero mean and unit variance) and normalization (min-max scaling).
3. Data normalization: This is the process of transforming data to a common format or unit, such as converting categorical data into numerical data using one-hot encoding or scaling data to a specific range or distribution.
4. Data augmentation: This technique generates new training samples by applying transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping) to the existing dataset, which can help improve model performance and reduce overfitting.
5. Data splitting: This step involves dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting.

These preprocessing steps are crucial for improving model performance, reducing training time, and preventing overfitting. The specific preprocessing techniques used depend on the dataset and the deep learning model being trained.
