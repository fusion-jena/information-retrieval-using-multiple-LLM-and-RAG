Answer:::
The context provided does not give explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the training process took roughly 4 days, which suggests the use of high-performance computing hardware, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), to accelerate the computations. These types of hardware are commonly used for deep learning tasks due to their ability to perform parallel computations, which significantly speeds up the training process compared to using only CPUs.
