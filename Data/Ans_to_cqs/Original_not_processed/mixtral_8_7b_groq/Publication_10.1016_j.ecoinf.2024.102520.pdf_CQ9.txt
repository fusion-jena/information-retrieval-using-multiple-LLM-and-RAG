After reviewing the provided context, I was unable to find information regarding the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several studies related to soil substrates, land use and land cover, topographic variables, and vegetation in a region studied in northern India. However, none of these studies mentioned the use of a deep learning pipeline or provided information about a data repository for such a pipeline.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it falls outside the scope of the given context. I recommend checking the original studies or contacting the authors for more information regarding the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
