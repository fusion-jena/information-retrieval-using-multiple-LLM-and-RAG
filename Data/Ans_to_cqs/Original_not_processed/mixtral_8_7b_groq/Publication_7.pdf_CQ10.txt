I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not include information about a specific code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on discussing the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification and recognition tasks, as well as their application to coral reef image analysis. It cites several research papers and describes the process of using pre-trained networks and fine-tuning them on specific datasets. However, it does not provide a link to a code repository.
