Answer:::
The provided context does not specify the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers in the described pipeline. The focus of the text is on minimizing biased training of machine learning models using covariance-weighted bagging, specifically in the context of predicting soil classes in semi-arid landscapes.

The machine learning model used is bagging, which is an ensemble learning technique that involves creating multiple subsets of the original data, fitting a model on each subset, and then combining the predictions. This approach helps to reduce overfitting and improve the robustness of the model.

The specific implementation of bagging used here is with default hyperparameters, including 500 trees (ntree = 500), a minimum number of observations in a terminal node of 5 (nodesize = 5), and trying a number of variables at each split based on the square root of the number of predictors (mtry = ⌊Nβ
⌋ = 1, where Nβ = 5 is the number of predictors).

Therefore, the type of deep learning model is not specified in the given context, and the machine learning model used is bagging.
