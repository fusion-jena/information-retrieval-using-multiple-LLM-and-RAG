Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include the learning rate, optimizer, number of anchor scales and aspect ratios, and non-maximum suppression (NMS) thresholds.

The learning rate is set to 0.0025, which controls the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. The optimizer used is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which is a popular optimization algorithm for deep learning models.

The model also uses six anchor scales, which are the square root of the area of the anchors in absolute pixels. The anchor scales used are [32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024]. Additionally, there are three aspect ratios of [1:2, 1:1, 2:1] for each anchor scale. Anchor boxes are predefined bounding boxes that are used as a reference to predict the location of objects in an image.

The non-maximum suppression (NMS) thresholds are used to eliminate redundant bounding boxes that have a high overlap with each other. The NMS threshold for training is set to 0.6, and for testing, it is set to 0.25.

The deep learning model is implemented using the Detectron2 library in the PyTorch framework. The model is trained using a minibatch size of four images per GPU (TITAN Xp) due to the large image size and additional parameters of Faster R-CNN.

In summary, the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include a learning rate of 0.0025, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer, six anchor scales, three aspect ratios, and non-maximum suppression (NMS) thresholds of 0.6 for training and 0.25 for testing.
