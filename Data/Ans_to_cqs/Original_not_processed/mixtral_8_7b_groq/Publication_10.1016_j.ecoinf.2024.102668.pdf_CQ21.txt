Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, the context does provide information about preprocessing steps for audio signal data.

In the proposed preprocessing methodology (2.3), the first step is to introduce characteristics and the resulting acoustic data. This step may involve collecting audio data from various sources, such as microphones of different brands or those that have been used outdoors for extended periods. As mentioned in context 3, the signal amplitude of a microphone depends on the sound pressure that the microphone can capture, which can vary based on the manufacturing materials and level of degradation. Therefore, it is important to consider these factors during preprocessing.

The second step in the preprocessing methodology is to use normalization techniques to reduce the effects of varying signal amplitudes. Specifically, the context suggests using a Parzen estimator, which is a type of non-parametric density estimation technique. This technique can help smooth out the variations in signal amplitude and make the data more suitable for analysis.

The third step in the preprocessing methodology is to use feature extraction techniques to extract relevant features from the audio signal data. The context suggests using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), which are commonly used in speech and audio signal processing. MFCCs can capture the spectral characteristics of audio signals and are useful for analyzing sounds produced by songbirds, as mentioned in the context.

Therefore, while the context does not provide specific information about postprocessing steps after model training, it does provide information about preprocessing steps that are important for preparing audio signal data for analysis. These steps include introducing characteristics and resulting acoustic data, normalizing the data using techniques such as Parzen estimation, and extracting relevant features using techniques such as MFCCs.
