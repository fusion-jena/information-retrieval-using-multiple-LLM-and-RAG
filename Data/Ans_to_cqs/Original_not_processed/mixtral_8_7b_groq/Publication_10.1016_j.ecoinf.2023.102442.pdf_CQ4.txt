Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the deep learning pipeline for detecting artisanal small-scale mining in Ghana (Gallwey et al., 2020). However, the study by Couttenier et al. (2022) mentions using a deep learning model for mapping artisanal and small-scale mines at a large scale from space, but it does not specify the data augmentation techniques used in their pipeline.

Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size of the training dataset and reduce overfitting. These techniques include flipping, rotating, scaling, and other transformations that generate new samples by applying modifications to the existing data.

In the context of remote sensing and land use/land cover (LULC) classification, data augmentation techniques can be useful for improving the model's performance in detecting and classifying objects of interest, such as mining areas. For instance, the study by Elmes et al. (2018) mentions applying a data-fusion reclassification approach using CART on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, but it does not specify the use of data augmentation techniques.

Therefore, while data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, the provided context does not explicitly mention their use in the studies related to mining detection and LULC classification.
