Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, we can infer some steps that might have been taken based on common deep learning practices.

Answer:::
After training the DeepLab model for the LULC (Land Use and Land Cover) classification task, the model would need to be deployed to a platform where it can make predictions on new, unseen data. Based on the context, we can infer that the following steps might have been taken:

1. Model Serialization: The first step would be to serialize the model, which involves saving the model's architecture, learned parameters, and optimizer information to a file. This file can then be loaded later to make predictions. In Python, this can be done using libraries like `joblib` or `pickle`.

2. Platform Selection: Once the model is serialized, it can be deployed to a platform for making predictions. This could be a local machine, a server, or a cloud-based platform like AWS SageMaker or Google Cloud AI Platform. The context does not provide information on which platform was used.

3. Integration with Input Pipeline: The deployed model would need to be integrated with an input pipeline that takes in new data, preprocesses it, and feeds it into the model for prediction. This pipeline would depend on the format of the new data and the specific requirements of the model.

4. Evaluation and Monitoring: After deployment, the model's performance should be evaluated and monitored to ensure it is making accurate predictions. This could involve comparing the model's predictions to ground truth labels, checking the model's confidence scores, and monitoring the model's performance over time.

It's important to note that these are inferred steps based on common deep learning practices, and the actual process followed for deploying the model might have been different.
