Answer:::

The text provided does not give specific details about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention that they calculate metrics such as the model's accuracy. Specifically, they mention that when the model is tested on a set of images taken under conditions different from the images used for training, the model's accuracy is reduced substantially, to just above 31%. 

In addition, they calculate a confusion matrix implicity when they mention that "this accuracy is much higher than the one based on random selection of 38 classes (2.6%)". A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model (or "classifier") on a set of test data for which the true values are known. It allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm across different classes.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics such as accuracy and the creation of a confusion matrix. However, there is no explicit mention of other postprocessing techniques such as saliency maps.
