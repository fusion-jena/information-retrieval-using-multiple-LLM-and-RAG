Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is information about the preprocessing steps that are applied after the environmental classification phase, which may be relevant to the training of the deep learning model. However, the context does not directly mention the preprocessing steps applied before training the model. Therefore, the answer to the query will be based on the observed preprocessing steps after the environmental classification phase.

After completing the environmental classification phase, the system extracts a frame and applies image filtering/enhancement to it. Therefore, it can be inferred that the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include image filtering/enhancement. However, the context does not provide details about the specific image filtering/enhancement techniques used.

It is also worth noting that the context does not mention any other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, it is unclear whether these steps are also involved in the preprocessing phase.

In summary, based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include image filtering/enhancement. However, the context does not provide information on other preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.
