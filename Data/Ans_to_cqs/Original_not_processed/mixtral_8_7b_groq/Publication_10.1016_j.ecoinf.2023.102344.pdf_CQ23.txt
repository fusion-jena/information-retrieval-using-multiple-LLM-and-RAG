Based on the provided context, the following measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models:

1. Diverse Dataset: Although the specifics of the dataset are not provided, it is mentioned that the data was collected from five different location sites in Portugal. This suggests that the model was trained on a diverse dataset from various sampling locations.

2. Stratified Sampling: The dataset was stratified, meaning it was divided into subgroups that are representative of the original population. In this case, 80% of the data (240 data rows) was used for training the model, and 20% (60 data rows) was used for testing. This method of splitting the data helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and can generalize well to unseen data.

3. Multiple Pre-trained Models: In Approach 1, multiple pre-trained models were used, including EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobileNetV2, and InceptionV3. This allows for a more robust and generalizable model as it is not dependent on the performance of a single model.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning: In Approach 2, the default models were optimized by tuning the hyperparameters. This includes using Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM) as the optimization algorithm for all pre-trained models. This ensures that the models are trained effectively and can generalize well.

5. Hybrid Deep Neural Network: In Approach 3, a hybrid deep neural network was used for traceability modeling. This approach combines the strengths of different models, allowing for better generalization and robustness.

However, it is important to note that the context does not mention the use of cross-validation, which is another common technique used to ensure the generalizability of deep learning models. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on one subset, and testing it on another. This process is repeated multiple times, and the final performance is averaged across all runs. This method helps to further ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and can generalize well to unseen data.
