Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline being available on Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context focuses on various methods, techniques, and systems used in a public challenge for few-shot bioacoustic event detection. It includes the names of authors and papers, systems submitted to the challenge, baselines, prototypical approaches, and different types of neural networks used. However, there is no mention of a data repository or where to find the data used in the challenge. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
