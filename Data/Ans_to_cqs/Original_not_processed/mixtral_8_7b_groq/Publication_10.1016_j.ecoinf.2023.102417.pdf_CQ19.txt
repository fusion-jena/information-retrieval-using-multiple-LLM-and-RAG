Answer:::

The context provided mentions the use of the PyTorch library for building the deep learning model. PyTorch is a popular open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, which is used for applications such as natural language processing and computer vision. It provides a wide range of features, including tensor computation with strong GPU acceleration, deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system, and a dynamic computational graph for building and training neural networks.

However, the context does not mention any other deep learning frameworks being used for building the model. Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that the PyTorch library was used for building the deep learning model.
