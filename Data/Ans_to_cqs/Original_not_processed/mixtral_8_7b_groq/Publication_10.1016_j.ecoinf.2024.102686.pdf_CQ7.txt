Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, I can provide you with some general criteria that are commonly used for splitting data in machine learning, which might also be applicable to deep learning:

1. Random sampling: This is the most common method for splitting data. It involves randomly selecting a certain percentage of samples for each dataset (train, test, validation). This method ensures that the data is representative and unbiased.

2. Stratified sampling: In some cases, the data might be imbalanced or have a class distribution that is not uniform. Stratified sampling ensures that each dataset (train, test, validation) has a similar distribution of classes. This method is useful for maintaining the class distribution when training a model.

3. Time-series sampling: When dealing with time-series data, it is important to maintain the temporal order of the data. In this case, the data can be split based on time, where the train dataset contains data up to a certain time, and the test dataset contains data after that time.

4. Spatial sampling: In the context of the provided text, spatial sampling might be relevant. The data can be split based on spatial criteria, such as regions or locations. This method is useful when the data has spatial dependencies or when the model needs to be evaluated in different regions.

5. Domain-specific criteria: Depending on the specific problem or domain, there might be other criteria that are relevant for splitting the data. For example, in medical research, the data might be split based on patient demographics or clinical characteristics.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific criteria for splitting the data for deep learning model training, there are general methods that can be used for splitting data in machine learning. The choice of criteria depends on the specific problem and the characteristics of the data.
