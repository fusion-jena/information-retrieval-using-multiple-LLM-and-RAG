Based on the provided context, there is no information given about how the data was split for training the deep learning model. The context discusses the training of a deep learning model with an attention layer using different epoch values, and provides various tables and figures showing the mAP values, confusion matrix, F1 curve, P curve, PR curve, R curve, and training plots for the model trained with epoch-150. It also provides a table showing the computation time and accuracy for different datasets and epoch values. However, it does not mention how the data was split into training, testing, and validation sets. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
