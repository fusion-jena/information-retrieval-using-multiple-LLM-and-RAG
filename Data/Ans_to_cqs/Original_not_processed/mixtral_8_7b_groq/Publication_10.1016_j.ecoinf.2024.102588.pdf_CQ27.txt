The context does not provide detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the CNN model ensemble with an autoencoder showed better estimation performance for TDI, BMI, and FAI than other models. Therefore, it can be inferred that the developers chose to deploy this particular model.

As for the model deployment process, the context suggests that the developers used a deep learning model based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and combined it with an autoencoder. This implies that they likely serialized the trained model so that it could be saved and loaded later for making predictions. Model serialization is a common practice in deep learning model deployment, where the trained model is saved in a file, allowing it to be reused without having to retrain the model every time.

Furthermore, the developers might have selected a platform for deploying the model, but the context does not provide information on the platform used. The platform selection would depend on various factors such as the intended use case, the infrastructure available, and the resources required to run the model.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific details on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the developers likely serialized the model and selected a platform for deployment. However, the specifics of the platform selection and model serialization process are not provided in the context.
