Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when the training of the MLP model is complete. The text mentions that the parameter selection was performed by minimizing the mean squared error, but it does not specify the stopping criterion for the training process.

In general, machine learning models require a stopping criterion to avoid overfitting and to ensure that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the data. Common stopping criteria include:

1. Validation loss plateau: The training process is stopped when the validation loss does not decrease for a certain number of epochs.
2. Early stopping: The training process is stopped when the validation loss starts to increase, even if the training loss is still decreasing.
3. Patience: The training process is stopped when the validation loss does not decrease for a certain number of epochs, or when the improvement in the validation loss is below a certain threshold.

Without more information, it is not possible to determine which of these criteria, if any, were used to determine when the training of the MLP model was complete. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
