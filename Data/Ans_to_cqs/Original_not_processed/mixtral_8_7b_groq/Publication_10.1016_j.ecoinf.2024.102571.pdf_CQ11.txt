Answer:::

I am unable to provide the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the provided pieces of context. However, I can give some information related to the topic.

The context includes several studies related to wastewater treatment, water pollution control, and greenhouse gas emissions. These studies use various methods, including machine learning algorithms and neural networks, to analyze and model the data. However, none of the provided sources explicitly mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link for it.

In the context of wastewater treatment and sludge disposal, the study by Wang et al. (2024) mentions treated wastewater (3.69%) and sludge disposal-untreated part. Similarly, the study by Van Drecht et al. (2009) discusses global nitrogen and phosphate in urban wastewater for the period 1970 to 2050. These studies may have used data repositories for their research, but the links are not provided in the context.

In the context of greenhouse gas emissions, the study by Uzlu (2021) uses the grey wolf optimizer algorithm-optimized artificial neural networks to estimate greenhouse gas emissions in Turkey. This study may have used a data repository for the input data or the model, but the link is not provided in the context.

Therefore, while there are studies related to the topic in the provided context, the exact data repository link of the deep learning pipeline is not available. I recommend checking the original sources or contacting the authors for more information.
