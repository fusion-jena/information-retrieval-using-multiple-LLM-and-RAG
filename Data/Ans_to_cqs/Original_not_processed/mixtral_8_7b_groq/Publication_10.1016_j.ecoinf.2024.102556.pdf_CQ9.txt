Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. None of the cited papers or articles mention where the data used in their research is publicly available. It is common practice for researchers to provide information about data repositories in the Methods or Data Availability sections of their publications, but this information is missing in the context provided.

It is possible that the data repository is not publicly available due to privacy or ethical concerns, or because the data is too large to be hosted on a public repository. In such cases, researchers may provide instructions on how to access the data upon request.

If you are interested in the deep learning pipeline used in the context provided, I would recommend contacting the authors of the papers or articles directly to inquire about the data. They may be able to provide you with more information or instructions on how to access the data.

Another option is to search for related datasets on data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. You can use keywords related to the deep learning pipeline, such as "object detection," "feature extraction," or "Procapra przewalskii," to search for relevant datasets.

Overall, while the context provided does not include information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline, there are several ways to find related datasets or contact the authors for more information.
