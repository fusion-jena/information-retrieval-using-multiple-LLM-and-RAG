The provided context does not discuss data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Instead, it focuses on evaluating thematic maps produced by a calibrated statistical prediction method using resampling methods due to limited data availability.

In the deep learning pipeline, data annotation techniques are crucial for training models, especially for computer vision tasks. Here are some common data annotation techniques:

1. **Image-level annotation:** In this technique, annotators label an entire image with a single class or category. For example, annotators might label images as 'cat', 'dog', or 'car'. Image-level annotation is useful for image classification tasks.

2. **Bounding box annotation:** Annotators draw bounding boxes around objects of interest in an image. This technique is useful for object detection tasks, where the goal is to locate objects within an image and classify them.

3. **Semantic segmentation:** In semantic segmentation, annotators draw boundaries around objects and label each pixel within the boundary. This technique is useful for tasks where pixel-level accuracy is important, such as scene understanding or medical image analysis.

4. **Instance segmentation:** Instance segmentation combines object detection and semantic segmentation. Annotators draw boundaries around objects and label each pixel within the boundary with a unique instance ID. This technique is useful for tasks where counting or tracking individual objects is important, such as tracking cells in a microscopy image.

5. **Keypoint annotation:** Annotators identify and label key points or landmarks on objects within an image. This technique is useful for tasks where the precise location of specific parts of an object is important, such as facial recognition or pose estimation.

The provided context does not mention any of these data annotation techniques. Instead, it focuses on evaluating the accuracy of thematic maps produced by a statistical prediction method using resampling methods.
