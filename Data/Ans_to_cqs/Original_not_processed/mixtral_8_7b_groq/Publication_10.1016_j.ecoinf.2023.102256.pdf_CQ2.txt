Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in the context provided uses spectrograms, which are visual representations of audio data, as the primary format. Spectrograms are a type of image that illustrates the intensity of frequencies over time in an audio signal. 

The baseline model takes a spectrogram input and produces a probability for each of the 22 species. This indicates that the model is trained on spectrogram images. 

Additionally, the study investigates a method to incorporate spatial information with spectrograms using a multi-branch CNN. This further suggests that the model uses spectrograms as the data format. 

However, it's important to note that the initial audio data, before being converted into spectrograms, could be in any audio format such as WAV, MP3, etc. The context does not provide information on how the audio data was pre-processed before being converted into spectrograms. 

Therefore, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline in this context is spectrograms, which are images derived from audio data.
