The provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning models for animal recognition and counting. The text focuses on discussing the architecture of the models, specifically the ResNet family and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN), and how they address the challenge of detecting small objects in images.

The ResNet models are characterized by their number of CNN layers, including ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, ResNet101, and ResNet152. The context also introduces the term "stage" in the context of residual neural networks, which refers to a specific set of convolution layers that output feature maps with different resolutions.

The Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is used to combine feature maps from different layers, allowing for the detection of objects at different scales. The FPN helps to mitigate the loss of fine details that can occur during convolution operations, particularly in deeper layers where objects may be reduced to just 1 pixel.

In summary, while the provided context gives a detailed explanation of the architecture of the deep learning models for animal recognition and counting, it does not include information about the specific hyperparameters used, such as the learning rate or optimizer.
