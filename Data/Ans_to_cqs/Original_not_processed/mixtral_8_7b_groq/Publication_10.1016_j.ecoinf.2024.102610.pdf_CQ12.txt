Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. While the study by Keshavamurthy et al. (2022) discusses the application of machine learning and deep learning approaches for predicting infectious diseases, it does not mention the particular type of deep learning model employed.

The context focuses on the use of environmental and weather data for predicting tsetse fly relative numbers, the importance of feature elimination, and the impact of different sets of predictors on the accuracy of the model. However, it does not specify the deep learning architecture used in the study.
