Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is clear that an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is used in the study. ANNs are a type of neural network and a fundamental type of deep learning model, but they do not have the same level of complexity as more specialized deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers.

The study mentions that the ANN has five input variables, one hidden layer with 19 neurons, and one output variable. While ANNs can have multiple hidden layers and be quite deep, the ANN in this study has only one hidden layer, so it is not a deep neural network.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), but it is not a deep ANN, and it is not a specialized deep learning model such as a CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
