Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used for the automatic recognition of woody regrowth vegetation in repeat landscape photographs. The context mainly discusses the application of convolutional neural networks for image-based methods in landscape planning and the limitations of these methods in capturing and representing certain spatial attributes. Additionally, the context presents a case study of a park design project, describing the changes made in each iteration and their impact on the restorative potential. However, there is no mention of the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
