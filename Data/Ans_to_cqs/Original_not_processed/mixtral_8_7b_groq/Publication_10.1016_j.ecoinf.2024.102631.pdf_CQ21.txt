Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix after the model training. However, it does mention that a quantitative analysis is conducted using certain metrics.

After the training of the proposed dehazing model, the model's performance is evaluated using three different quantitative metrics: UIQM (Unsupervised Image Quality Metric), UCIQE (Underwater Color Image Quality Evaluation), and NIQE (Naturalness Image Quality Evaluator). These metrics are used to assess the quality of the output images produced by the model.

The model's performance is compared with several other methods in Table 4. The UIQM score, which measures the image quality and accounts for the clarity, colorfulness, and contrast of the image, is highest for the proposed model (3.17), followed by Water-Net (3.13) and Funie-GAN (3.05). The NIQE score, which evaluates the naturalness of the image, is lowest for the proposed model (0.568), indicating a more natural output image compared to other methods. The UCIQE score, which is a linear combination of chroma, saturation, and contrast, is highest for IBLA (0.626), although the text suggests that this might be due to color deviations rather than actual image improvement.

In summary, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps after the model training include the calculation of specific image quality metrics, namely UIQM, UCIQE, and NIQE, for a comparative analysis of the model's performance against other methods.
