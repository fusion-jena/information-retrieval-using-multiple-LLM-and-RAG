The provided context does not directly discuss the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, it does describe the process of preparing data for a MaxEnt model, which is a type of machine learning algorithm often used for ecological niche modeling.

The MaxEnt model's output was analyzed based on the averages of 10 replicate runs, estimating the relative contributions of environmental and territorial variables. The percentage contribution is determined by the increase in regularized gain added to the contribution of the corresponding variable in each iteration of the training algorithm. The permutation importance shows the values of that variable on training presence, and background data are randomly permuted. The model is then reevaluated on the permuted data, and the resulting drop in training AUC is shown, normalized to percentages.

From this description, we can infer that the following preprocessing steps were taken before training the MaxEnt model:

1. Data cleaning: The data used for the MaxEnt model appears to be clean and ready for analysis, as no mention of data cleaning steps is made in the provided context.
2. Normalization/Scaling: The context does not explicitly mention normalization or scaling of the data. However, it is possible that the data was normalized or scaled before being used in the MaxEnt model.
3. Feature engineering: The variables used in the MaxEnt model include temperature factors (bio4, bio8, bio9), precipitation factors (bio13, bio19), and geographical factors (slope, aspect, etc.). These variables were likely engineered from raw data to create features that could be used in the model.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly answer the query regarding preprocessing steps for deep learning models, it does suggest that data cleaning, normalization/scaling, and feature engineering are important preprocessing steps for machine learning models.
