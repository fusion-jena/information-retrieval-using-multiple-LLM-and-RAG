Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is stated in the first piece of context, which mentions that "Convolutional neural networks (CNN) outstand over DL techniques" are used in the architecture configurations. Additionally, the table comparing the performance of different models (AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201) further supports the use of CNNs, as these models are all well-known CNN architectures. The use of convolutional layers, ReLU, and max-pooling layers in the convolutional block of the architecture also supports the use of CNNs.
