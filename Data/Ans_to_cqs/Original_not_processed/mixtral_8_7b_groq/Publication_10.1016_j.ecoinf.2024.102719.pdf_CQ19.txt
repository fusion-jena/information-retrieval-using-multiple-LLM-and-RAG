Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific deep learning frameworks used in the studies referenced. The text mentions that deep learning and other machine learning models have been widely employed in river health predictions, but it does not specify which frameworks were used.

In general, when it comes to deep learning, there are several popular frameworks available, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Theano. TensorFlow, developed by Google Brain, and PyTorch, developed by Facebook's AI Research lab, are currently two of the most widely used deep learning frameworks.

TensorFlow is a powerful library for numerical computation, which allows for the design of complex architectures and has strong support for GPU acceleration. It provides flexibility, modularity, and ease of use, and has a large community of users.

PyTorch, on the other hand, is known for its simplicity and ease of use, and it has a dynamic computation graph, which allows for greater flexibility in designing and modifying models. PyTorch has gained popularity among researchers due to its seamless transition between CPUs and GPUs and its efficient memory usage.

Without more specific information from the context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer regarding which deep learning frameworks were used in the studies. However, it can be said that TensorFlow and PyTorch are two of the most commonly used frameworks for deep learning.
