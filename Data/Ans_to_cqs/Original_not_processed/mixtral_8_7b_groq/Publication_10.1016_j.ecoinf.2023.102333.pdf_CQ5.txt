The provided context does not mention any of the standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses a specific study that uses Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for land cover/land use (LCLU) classification in Talassemtane National Park (TNP). The dataset used in this study consists of Sentinel-2 satellite images, which are processed and analyzed using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model incorporating five spectral indices. The DNN model is trained to differentiate six land use classes.

The optimization of the DNN model involved executing optimization algorithms to find the highest accuracy from 1,788,160 hyperparameter combinations. The model was trained for 200 epochs for each trial to find three DNN architectures. These architectures were then used to build three models and train them for the entire dataset for 1000 epochs.

Therefore, the dataset used in this study is not one of the standard deep learning datasets but is instead a custom dataset created from Sentinel-2 satellite images for the specific purpose of LCLU classification in TNP.
