Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context mainly focuses on introducing the architecture, components, and training process of TrunkNet, a deep learning model for tree trunk detection. Therefore, I am unable to provide the specific location of the code repository in this case. I would recommend looking at the relevant papers or contacting the authors for more information.
