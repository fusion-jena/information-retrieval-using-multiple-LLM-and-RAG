The provided context does not contain information about the specific deep learning pipeline in question, so it is not possible to definitively answer what data formats are used in that pipeline. However, the context does provide some information about data formats used in various studies involving machine learning and bioinformatics.

In the study by Phillips et al. (2006), selected algorithms with regression and classification prediction tasks were used to ensure the processing of both continuous and categorical discrete values in the metadata. While the specific data formats are not mentioned, it can be inferred that the metadata likely included a mix of continuous (e.g., numerical) and categorical (e.g., nominal or ordinal) data.

The QGIS Geographic Information System (QGIS Development Team, 2022) is a software for handling geospatial data, which typically involves vector and raster formats. Vector data can include points, lines, and polygons, while raster data can include images and gridded data.

The study by Thompson et al. (2019) used machine learning to predict microbial community functions, analyzing dissolved organic carbon from litter decomposition. The data format used in this study is not explicitly stated, but it likely involved some form of tabular data (e.g., CSV) containing measurements of dissolved organic carbon and other relevant variables.

The BIOMOD platform for ensemble forecasting of species distributions (Thuiller et al., 2009) uses occurrence and environmental data to model species distributions. Occurrence data can be in the form of presence-only or presence-absence records, while environmental data can include various continuous and categorical variables. These data are likely stored in tabular formats (e.g., CSV).

The study by Topçuoğlu et al. (2020) presents a framework for effective application of machine learning to microbiome-based classification problems. The data formats used in this study are not explicitly stated, but they likely involved sequencing data (e.g., FASTA) and metadata (e.g., CSV).

In summary, while the provided context does not contain information about the specific deep learning pipeline in question, it does indicate that various data formats can be used in machine learning pipelines, including tabular data (e.g., CSV), vector and raster geospatial data, sequencing data, and possibly others (e.g., image, audio, video). The specific data formats used would depend on the nature of the problem and the data available.
