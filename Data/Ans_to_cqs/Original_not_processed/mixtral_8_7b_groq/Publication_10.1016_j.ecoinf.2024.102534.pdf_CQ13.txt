Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the deep learning model used, its hyperparameters, or the training process. The text focuses on the use of an ensemble model for species distribution of orchids in New Guinea, taking into account climate change and land cover change. It mentions the use of data to validate model predictions, with the Area Under Curve (AUC) and True Skill Statistics (TSS) as evaluation metrics. The model classifies suitable and unsuitable areas for four groups of orchids in different time periods.

However, the provided context does not include any details about the deep learning model, its architecture, or the hyperparameters used, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, or number of epochs. The focus of the text is on the application of the ensemble model for orchid species distribution analysis and the impact of climate change on their suitable areas.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query regarding the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.

Answer:::
No specific information is provided in the context about the deep learning model's hyperparameters, such as the learning rate or optimizer.
