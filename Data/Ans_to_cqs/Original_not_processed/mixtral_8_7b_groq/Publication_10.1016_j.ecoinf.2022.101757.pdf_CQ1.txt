Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific details about the raw data collection methods used in the deep learning pipeline for the study. However, it does mention the use of LUCAS images, which are likely derived from surveys.

The study by Martinez-Sanchez et al. (2022) uses LUCAS images from 2018, specifically those labeled as cropland (LC = B) and grasslands (LC = E). These images were then processed using a deep learning model, DeepLabv3+, with COCO classes for semantic segmentation. The Conditional Random Fields (CRF) method was applied to improve the delineation of the skyline in the segmented images.

The LUCAS images are part of the Land Use/Cover Area Frame Survey, which is a large-scale survey conducted by the European Commission's statistical office, Eurostat. The survey provides detailed information about land use and cover across Europe, and the images used in this study are likely derived from this survey.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the methods used for raw data collection, it can be inferred that the study used LUCAS images, which are derived from a survey. Additionally, the use of public datasets, such as COCO, is also implied in the study. However, specific details about other sensors or data collection methods are not provided in the context.
