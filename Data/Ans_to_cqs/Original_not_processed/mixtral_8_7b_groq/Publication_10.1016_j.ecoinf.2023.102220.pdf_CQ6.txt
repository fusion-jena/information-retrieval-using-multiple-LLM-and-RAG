Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of a deep learning model for a specific case study, but it does not give detailed information about the preprocessing steps applied before training the model. However, it is mentioned that the model is a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with LSTM blocks, and it is implemented using Python, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn libraries.

In general, when working with time series data, common preprocessing steps include:

1. **Data cleaning**: This step involves handling missing or corrupted data points. Techniques such as interpolation, mean or median imputation, or simply removing the problematic instances can be applied.
2. **Scaling and normalization**: Deep learning models, especially neural networks, are sensitive to the scale of input features. Thus, it is essential to preprocess the data to have similar ranges. Common techniques include min-max scaling, z-score normalization, or scaling to unit variance.
3. **Feature engineering**: This step may involve creating new features based on domain knowledge or transforming existing features to better capture the underlying patterns. For time series data, this could include lagged features, moving averages, or Fourier transformations.
4. **Train-test split**: To evaluate the model's performance, it is essential to split the dataset into training and testing subsets. In the context of time series, it is crucial to use time-based splits, such as the first 70% for training, the next 15% for validation, and the last 15% for testing.

For the provided context, it can be inferred that the dataset consists of time series data with neuron counts at each time step. However, specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned. It is possible that the data was cleaned, scaled, and engineered before applying the described machine learning methods. Nonetheless, the context does not provide enough information to answer this query conclusively.
