Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions a dataset of 9717 images of 15 wild bird species acquired by camera traps in Chinaâ€™s Northeast Tiger and Leopard National Park, but it does not specify where this dataset is available for access. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
