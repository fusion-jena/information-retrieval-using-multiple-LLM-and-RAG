Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. However, the context does provide information about the use of deep learning models in processing LiDAR data for various applications.

In the study by You et al. (2023), a deep learning model was used to generate a canopy height model (CHM) from LiDAR data, which met the data requirements for individual tree segmentation. The LiDAR data had a point density of 78 points/m2.

Liu and Abd-Elrahman (2018) used a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for wetlands classification using unmanned aerial systems (UAS) imagery. They used multi-view object-based analysis of UAS imagery for training the CNN.

Marasigan et al. (2019) measured mangrove crown diameter from airborne LiDAR data using a marker-controlled watershed algorithm. They explored the performance of the algorithm for different LiDAR point densities.

Martins et al. (2021) used a machine learning approach with SLIC for tree canopies segmentation in urban areas using LiDAR data. They used the bird's eye view (BEV) Faster region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) algorithm for segmentation.

Table 6 in the context provides statistics of the segmentation results with the BEV Faster R-CNN algorithm, including true positives (TP), false negatives (FN), false positives (FP), recall (R), precision (P), and F1 score (F) for low-density (LD), medium-density (MD), and high-density (HD) sites.

Therefore, while the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models are not provided, the context does give insight into the use of deep learning models for processing LiDAR data for various applications.
