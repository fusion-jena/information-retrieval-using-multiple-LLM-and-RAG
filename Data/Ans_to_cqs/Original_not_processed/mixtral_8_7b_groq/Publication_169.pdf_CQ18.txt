Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model's performance during training. However, it is mentioned that the training process took around 10 hours on a CPU and reached an accuracy of 95% on 140 epochs. This suggests that the performance was measured in terms of accuracy, and the training was continued until a satisfactory level of accuracy was achieved.

Moreover, the context mentions that the proposed CNN-LSTM model was compared with conventional CNN and other state-of-the-art approaches to justify its performance. This comparison implies that the performance of the proposed model was evaluated not only in terms of its own accuracy but also in relation to other models.

Additionally, the authors measured the performance of the proposed model by first evaluating its effectiveness in classifying plant species and then comparing it with the accuracy reported in the literature. This suggests that the authors used a two-step performance evaluation strategy, where they first measured the performance of their proposed model and then compared it with other models.

Therefore, while the specific strategy for monitoring the model's performance during training is not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that the authors used a combination of accuracy measurement and comparison with other models to evaluate the performance of their proposed CNN-LSTM model.
