Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several research papers related to deep learning models and techniques, but none of them mention or provide a link to the data repository used in their research.

The first paper by Vanhoucke and Rabinovich (2015) proposes a method for going deeper with convolutions in deep learning models. The second paper by Tan et al. (2019) presents MnasNet, a platform-aware neural architecture search for mobile devices. The third paper by WÃ¤gele et al. (2022) discusses the development of a multisensor station for automated biodiversity monitoring. While these papers describe the datasets used in their research, they do not provide information about the data repository.

The context also includes a description of a deep learning pipeline for estimating the age of chimpanzees based on DNA methylation (Ito et al., 2018). However, there is no information available about the data repository used in this research.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as the necessary information is not available in the provided context.
