After reviewing the provided sources, there is no clear information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the studies. While the studies mention using Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a cloud processing platform, GEE does not appear to be a data repository for the deep learning pipeline.

Sources such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF are commonly used data repositories in research, but none of the sources mention using any of these platforms for the deep learning pipeline data.

It is possible that the data repository is not publicly available or was not mentioned in the sources provided. If the data repository becomes available in the future, it would be helpful for reproducibility and further research.

In summary, there is no clear information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the studies based on the provided sources.
