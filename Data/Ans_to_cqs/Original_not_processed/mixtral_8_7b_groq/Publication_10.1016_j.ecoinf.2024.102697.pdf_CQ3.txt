Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general information about common data annotation techniques used in deep learning.

Annotation techniques are crucial in deep learning, especially in the field of computer vision, as they help in training models to understand and interpret visual data. Here are some common data annotation techniques:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest in an image. It helps the model to locate and classify objects within the image.

2. Instance segmentation: This is a more advanced technique that involves labeling each pixel in an image to represent the object it belongs to. It provides a more precise outline of the object and is useful for models that require detailed object boundaries.

3. Semantic segmentation: In this technique, pixels are grouped according to the object class they represent, but without distinguishing between instances of the same class. It is useful for understanding the composition of scenes and materials in images.

4. Landmark annotation: This technique involves identifying and labeling key points or landmarks on objects within an image. It is useful for models that need to understand the spatial relationships between different parts of an object.

5. Scene text annotation: This technique focuses on identifying and extracting text from images. It is useful for applications like optical character recognition (OCR) and natural language processing (NLP).

The choice of annotation technique depends on the specific problem and the desired outcome. For instance, if the goal is to detect and count objects within an image, bounding box annotation might be sufficient. However, if the goal is to understand the detailed shape and structure of objects, instance segmentation would be more appropriate.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, common techniques include bounding box annotation, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, landmark annotation, and scene text annotation. The choice of technique depends on the specific problem and desired outcome.
