Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model can include the learning rate and the optimizer.

The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. It is a hyperparameter because it is not learned from the data; instead, it is set prior to training. The learning rate can have a significant impact on the training time and the final performance of the model. If the learning rate is too high, the model may converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution or even diverge; if it is too low, the model may require many iterations to converge, leading to longer training times.

The optimizer is another hyperparameter used in deep learning models. It is a method that specifies the procedure for updating the model's parameters during training. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), adaptive moment estimation (Adam), and root mean square propagation (RMSprop). These optimizers use different strategies for updating the parameters, such as using the gradient of the loss function and the previous updates to adjust the learning rate.

In addition to the learning rate and optimizer, other hyperparameters used in deep learning models can include the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, the activation function, the regularization parameter, and the batch size. These hyperparameters can significantly affect the model's performance and should be carefully chosen based on the specific problem and dataset.

It is worth noting that the context does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model mentioned in the study. Therefore, the hyperparameters used in that particular model may differ from those mentioned here.
