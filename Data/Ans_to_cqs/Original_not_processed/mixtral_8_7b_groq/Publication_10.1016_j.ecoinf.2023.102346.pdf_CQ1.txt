Answer:::

The provided pieces of context do not contain specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention some sources of data that are used in various studies.

For instance, in the field of geographic information systems (GIS), QGIS is an open-source software that is used for creating, editing, and analyzing geospatial data. The data used in GIS can come from various sources, such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets. In the context of microbiology, Topçuoğlu et al. (2020) mention the use of 16S rRNA gene sequencing data, which is a common method for collecting raw data in microbiome studies.

In the context of species distribution modeling, Thuiller et al. (2009) use occurrence data for species, which can be collected through various methods such as field surveys, museum collections, and citizen science projects. Tyberghein et al. (2012) use environmental data for the marine environment, which can be collected through sensors, remote sensing, and public datasets.

In the context of machine learning in microbiology, Jiang et al. (2022) mention the use of various types of omics data, such as genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic data, which can be collected through various methods such as sequencing, microarrays, and mass spectrometry.

Therefore, while the pieces of context do not provide a comprehensive list of methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, they do suggest that a variety of methods are used depending on the specific field of study and the research question. These methods can include surveys, sensors, public datasets, sequencing, microarrays, and mass spectrometry, among others.
