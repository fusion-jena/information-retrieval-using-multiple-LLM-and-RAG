Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into subsets such as train, test, and validation. However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to split the data into these subsets to evaluate the performance of the model and prevent overfitting.

In general, there are several methods to split the data for model training. One common approach is to randomly split the data into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters and evaluate the model during the training process, and the test set is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model. The exact proportions of the data that should be allocated to each subset may vary depending on the size and complexity of the data.

Another approach is k-fold cross-validation, where the data is divided into k subsets or "folds". The model is trained on k-1 folds, and the remaining fold is used for validation. This process is repeated k times, with a different fold used for validation each time. The average performance of the model over the k iterations is then used as the final evaluation metric.

It is worth noting that the provided context discusses the use of Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) for big data analysis, which is a type of feedforward neural network that differs from deep learning models such as autoencoders. However, the principles of data splitting and evaluation apply to both ELMs and deep learning models.
