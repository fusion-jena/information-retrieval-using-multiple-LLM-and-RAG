The provided context discusses the use of remote sensing data, specifically GF-6 (WFV) data, for bathymetry retrieval using regression tree models such as CART and Random Forest Regression (RFR). While the text does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps for deep learning models, it does describe data preprocessing for the GF-6 data and the CART model.

For the GF-6 data, the preprocessing steps include radiometric calibration, atmospheric correction, geometric correction, and image cropping. Radiometric calibration aims to eliminate variations in sensor response and quantize at-sensor radiance. Atmospheric correction addresses the scattering and absorption effects of the atmosphere on electromagnetic radiation. Geometric correction aligns image data with real-world coordinates, and image cropping involves selecting the Region of Interest (ROI) for further analysis.

In the context of the CART model, the authors mention fine-tuning specific model parameters such as 'max_depth', 'min_samples_leaf', and 'max_leaf_nodes' to optimize the regression decision tree for efficiency and suitability. These steps can be considered part of the model-specific preprocessing.

As for deep learning models, common preprocessing steps include:

1. Normalization: Scaling input features to a similar range, often between 0 and 1, to avoid any feature dominating the learning process.
2. Scaling: Adjusting the range of features to improve model performance, especially for distance-based algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors.
3. Cleaning: Handling missing or corrupted data points, either by removing, imputing, or using techniques like data interpolation.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps for deep learning models, it does discuss data preprocessing for GF-6 remote sensing data and the CART model. Common preprocessing steps for deep learning models include normalization, scaling, and cleaning.
