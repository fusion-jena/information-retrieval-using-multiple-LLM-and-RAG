Answer:::

The provided context does not give information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. The text describes the methods and tools used to analyze the data, including standardization as a preprocessing technique. It also mentions the use of statistical models, specifically the M1, M2, M3, M4, and M5 models, but it does not provide details on the optimization of the hyperparameters for these models. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization, but the context does not specify which method was used. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given information.
