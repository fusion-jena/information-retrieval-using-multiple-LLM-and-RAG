Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the deep learning frameworks used for building the systems submitted to the public challenge. We can only determine the methods and techniques used in the systems, such as template matching, Mel +PCEN, prototypical networks, and various types of CNNs (e.g., ResNet).

Some of the systems use a combination of techniques, like Wu_SHNU (+Wu 2023 ICASSP) DFSL with Moummad_IMT (Other) and You et al. (2023) (ICASSP 2023) with Proto and Dist:Proto. These combinations suggest that multiple frameworks might have been used, as different techniques could be implemented in different deep learning frameworks.

In general, deep learning models can be built using various frameworks, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and others. The choice of framework often depends on the specific requirements of the project, the expertise of the development team, and the ease of implementation for the chosen techniques.

Since the context does not provide specific details about the deep learning frameworks used, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
