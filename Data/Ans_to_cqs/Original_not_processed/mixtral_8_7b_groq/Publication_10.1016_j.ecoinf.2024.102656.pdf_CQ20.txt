Based on the provided context, there is no information about the use of any deep learning models for this study. The study focuses on the development of ensemble habitat suitability models for three species (wild goat, Urial, and Jebeer gazelle) using five component models (GLM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, and MARS). The models demonstrate variable performance, with RF performing the best and GLM performing the worst. The variables that play important roles in predicting habitat suitability include distance to mining roads, distance to roads, distance to Conservation Areas (CAs), and distance to water resources. Connectivity predictions were implemented in UNICOR over the resistance map for the species to find the shortest path between start and end occurrence records. However, there is no mention of any hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs used for training deep learning models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query.
