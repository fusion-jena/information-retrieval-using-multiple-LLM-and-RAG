Answer:

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting that were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the experiments were performed on a small-size dataset of butterfly specimen data, which was standardized. The models, MG and MO, were able to achieve good training results and performed well in their own validation set. This indicates that the models were able to learn and generalize effectively from the given dataset to some extent.

The text also mentions that to test the models' performance on other complex images, more experiments would be required after collecting more images from different sources. This suggests an intention to assess the models' ability to generalize to new, unseen data, which is a crucial aspect of building a robust and generalizable model.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit details about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it does imply that the models were tested on their own validation set and there were plans to test them on new, diverse data. However, for a comprehensive evaluation of the model's generalizability, it would be essential to implement techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, and using a diverse dataset during the training process.
