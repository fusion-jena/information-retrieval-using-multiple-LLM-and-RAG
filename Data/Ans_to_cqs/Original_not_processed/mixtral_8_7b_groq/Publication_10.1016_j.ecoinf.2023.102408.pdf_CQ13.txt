In the context provided, the specific deep learning model mentioned is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) fitted with the CARET package. The hyperparameters used in this model are the size and decay. 

The 'size' refers to the number of units in the hidden layer of the ANN. This is an important hyperparameter because it directly influences the complexity and capacity of the model. A larger size means a more complex model with greater capacity to learn, but it also increases the risk of overfitting.

The 'decay' is a regularization parameter used to prevent overfitting. It controls the strength of a penalty added to the loss function, which discourages large weights and promotes a simpler model. The decay value is a trade-off between bias and variance, and it needs to be carefully tuned to achieve optimal performance.

It is important to note that the learning rate and optimizer are not explicitly mentioned as hyperparameters in this specific ANN model. The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of the loss function. The optimizer is the algorithm used to update the weights and biases in the network based on the gradient of the loss function. However, these details are not provided in the context.

In summary, the hyperparameters used in the ANN model mentioned in the context are the size and decay. The size controls the complexity of the model, and the decay prevents overfitting. The learning rate and optimizer are not explicitly mentioned as hyperparameters in this model.
