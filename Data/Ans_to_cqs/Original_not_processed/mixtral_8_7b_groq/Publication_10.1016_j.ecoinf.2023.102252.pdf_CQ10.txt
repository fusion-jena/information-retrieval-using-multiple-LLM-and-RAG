Answer:::
I don't know.
The provided context contains a mathematical model for environmental flow and riparian ecosystems, specifically discussing the FERM (Flow- Ecogeomorphic Responses in Rivers and Floodplains Model) model. It explains the parameters and equations used to calculate the ecological targets based on inundation and dry spell durations. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline, nor any link to a code repository on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
