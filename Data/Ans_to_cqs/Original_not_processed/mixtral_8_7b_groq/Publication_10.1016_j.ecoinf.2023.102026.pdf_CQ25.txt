Answer:::

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Instead, it discusses the use of machine learning models, specifically Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and Random Forests (RFs), for species distribution modeling. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer regarding the purpose of a deep learning model in this context.
