Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the pre-trained model underwent fine-tuning for four iterations using the entire SW stratum. This suggests that some level of preprocessing was done to the data before it was used for fine-tuning the model.

In general, when training deep learning models, it is common to perform several preprocessing steps on the data. These steps can include:

1. Normalization: This involves scaling the input data to a range that is suitable for the model. This can help to improve the model's convergence during training.
2. Scaling: Similar to normalization, scaling involves transforming the data to a different range. This can be useful when the input features have different scales.
3. Cleaning: This involves removing any noise or outliers from the data. This can help to improve the model's performance by reducing the amount of irrelevant information.

In the context of remote sensing and image classification, other preprocessing steps that are commonly performed include:

1. Image augmentation: This involves creating new training examples by applying random transformations to the original images. This can help to improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.
2. Feature extraction: This involves extracting relevant features from the images that can be used as input to the model. This can include techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) or histogram equalization.
3. Tile or patch creation: This involves dividing the images into smaller tiles or patches that can be used as input to the model. This can help to reduce the computational cost of training the model.

While the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned in the provided context, it is clear that some level of data preparation was done before fine-tuning the pre-trained model.
