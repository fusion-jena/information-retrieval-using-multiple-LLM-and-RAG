Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Specifically, the Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Network) model proposed by Ren et al. (2017) is utilized in constructing the PCθ module of the counting pipeline. Furthermore, other approaches considered in the pipeline are inspired by FCRN or utilize similar architectures to Tian et al. (2019), which also belong to the family of CNNs. Therefore, it can be concluded that the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CNN.
