Answer:::
The context provided does not explicitly mention the specific deep learning framework used to build the model. However, both PyTorch and TensorFlow are widely used for building and training complex neural network architectures. Given that the network design and components are detailed in the context, it can be inferred that the model was likely implemented using either of these two popular frameworks. Without more specific information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
