Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized in the studies by Kuru et al. (2013, 2023) and Leira et al. (2015). The papers do not mention any specific techniques such as grid search, random search, or others for hyperparameter tuning.

In the 2013 study by Kuru et al., the authors proposed a novel report generation approach for medical applications called SIDS Methodology. However, they did not provide details about the optimization of hyperparameters in their methodology. Similarly, in the 2023 study by Kuru et al., the authors introduced Wildetect, an intelligent platform to perform airborne wildlife census using an ensemble of learning techniques and computer vision. Although they mentioned using an ensemble of learning techniques, they did not specify how the hyperparameters of these techniques were optimized.

Leira et al. (2015) presented a method for automatic detection, classification, and tracking of objects in the ocean surface from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) using a thermal camera. However, they did not provide information about hyperparameter optimization in their study.

In summary, there is no explicit information in the provided context about how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized in the studies by Kuru et al. (2013, 2023) and Leira et al. (2015). Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
