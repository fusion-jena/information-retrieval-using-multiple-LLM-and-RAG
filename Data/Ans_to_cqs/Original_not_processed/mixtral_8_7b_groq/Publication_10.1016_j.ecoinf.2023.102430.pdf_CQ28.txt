Based on the provided context, there is no information available about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model for identifying triatomine genera. The context focuses on the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify specimens from the Triatominae subfamily, which are the main vectors of human Chagas disease. It mentions the assessment of algorithm performance at the genus level, with all the bugs falling into one of the three genera that include the main vectors of Chagas disease. The study used a dataset consisting of pictures taken with ordinary cellphone cameras, demonstrating that CNNs can identify these major triatomine genera with high accuracy using low-resolution images.

However, the context does not mention any details about the platform used for deploying the deep learning model. It could be any platform, such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform, or even a local server, but the provided information does not offer any insights into this aspect.

In conclusion, the provided context does not contain information about the platform used to deploy the deep learning model for triatomine genus identification.
