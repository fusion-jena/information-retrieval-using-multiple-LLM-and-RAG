The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the model is trained using the Caffe framework [35]. Caffe supports both CPU and GPU training, so it's possible that either or both of these types of hardware resources were used. It's also worth noting that many modern deep learning models, especially those involving large datasets and complex computations, are often trained using GPUs due to their greater processing power and ability to handle parallel operations. Therefore, while the context does not provide a definitive answer, it's likely that GPUs were used for training this deep learning model.
