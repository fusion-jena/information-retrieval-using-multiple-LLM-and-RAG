Based on the information provided, the specific details of the deep learning model's purpose are not given in the Keshavamurthy et al., 2022 study. The study focuses on the systematic review of machine learning and deep learning approaches for predicting infectious diseases, but it does not delve into the specific application of deep learning models.

However, deep learning models are commonly used for various tasks in image, speech, and natural language processing. In the context of predicting infectious diseases, deep learning models can be employed for classification, segmentation, or detection tasks.

For instance, in medical imaging, deep learning models can be used for segmentation to identify and outline regions of interest, such as infected tissues or organs. Similarly, deep learning models can be used for classification tasks to categorize medical images based on the presence or absence of a particular disease. Furthermore, deep learning models can be employed for object detection to identify and locate specific features in images, such as the detection of pathogens in microscopic images.

In summary, while the specific purpose of the deep learning model in the Keshavamurthy et al., 2022 study is not provided, deep learning models are commonly used for classification, segmentation, or detection tasks in various fields, including infectious disease prediction.
