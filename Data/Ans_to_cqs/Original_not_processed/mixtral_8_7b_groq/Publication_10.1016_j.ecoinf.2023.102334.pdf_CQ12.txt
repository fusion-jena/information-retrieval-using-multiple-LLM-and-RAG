Answer:::

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Transformer. This is stated in the first sentence of the context, which mentions that "ViT is the first significant effort to employ a pure Transformer on pictures directly." The Transformer model is a deep neural network that was originally developed for natural language processing (NLP) and is based on a self-attention mechanism that allows for significantly large receptive fields. In the context of this work, the Transformer model is used to accurately identify sika deer by modeling global attention using features extracted by a CNN backbone, such as ResNet. The Transformer model is able to combine data from the entire image and accurately model long-term relationships between pixels, making it well-suited for this task.
