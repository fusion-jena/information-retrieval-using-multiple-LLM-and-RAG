Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can make some educated guesses based on the types of data and tasks mentioned.

The data used in the study is satellite imagery from the Sentinel-2 mission and labels for drought impact forecasting, specifically the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). This suggests that the annotations are likely related to pixel-level classification or segmentation, rather than object-level annotations such as bounding boxes.

The study uses a deep learning model called ConvLSTM, which is a combination of convolutional and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers. Convolutional layers are commonly used in computer vision tasks for feature extraction, while LSTM layers are used for sequential data processing. In this case, the sequential data is likely the time series of satellite images.

While the context does not explicitly mention any data annotation techniques, it does mention the use of the EarthNet2021 challenge dataset. According to the EarthNet2021 website, the dataset provides "pre-processed and annotated satellite images" for various land use and land cover classes. However, it does not provide details on the specific annotation techniques used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is likely that pixel-level classification or segmentation annotations were used in the deep learning pipeline, but the specific techniques are not specified.
