Answer:::

The text provided does not give specific details about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the task of semantic segmentation. However, it does mention that the task is to segment trees inside a Cerrado urban environment using a proposed imagery dataset.

In semantic segmentation, each pixel in an image is assigned a class label, and it is a pixel-level classification problem. Therefore, the data annotation technique used here would be pixel-level annotation, where each pixel in the image is annotated with the class label of the object it belongs to, in this case, trees or not trees.

Additionally, the paper mentions using the Lovasz-Softmax Loss, which is a loss function used for training deep neural networks for semantic segmentation tasks. It is a surrogate for the optimization of the Intersection-Over-Union (IoU) measure, which is a common evaluation metric for semantic segmentation tasks.

The paper also mentions using the DeepLabV3+ architecture, which is a state-of-the-art architecture for semantic segmentation tasks. The architecture uses Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) to extract features at multiple scales and alleviate the loss of spatial information due to prior pooling or convolutions with striding operations.

In summary, while the text does not provide specific details about the data annotation techniques used, it can be inferred that pixel-level annotation was used for the task of semantic segmentation. Additionally, the Lovasz-Softmax Loss and the DeepLabV3+ architecture were used in the deep learning pipeline.
