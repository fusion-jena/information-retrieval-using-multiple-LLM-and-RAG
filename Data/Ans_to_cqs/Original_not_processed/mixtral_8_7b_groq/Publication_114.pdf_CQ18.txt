Answer:

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the model performance was evaluated using user's accuracy (UA), producer's accuracy (PA), and F1-Score for each tree type. These metrics were calculated for three deep learning algorithms, namely VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet.

Moreover, the overall accuracy (OA) and kappa coefficient were also reported, which provide insights into the model's performance in classifying different tree species. The OA measures the total percentage of correct classifications, while the kappa coefficient evaluates the agreement between the predicted and actual classifications, taking into account the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the model performance was monitored by calculating various accuracy metrics for each tree type and the overall model. However, the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not provided in the context.
