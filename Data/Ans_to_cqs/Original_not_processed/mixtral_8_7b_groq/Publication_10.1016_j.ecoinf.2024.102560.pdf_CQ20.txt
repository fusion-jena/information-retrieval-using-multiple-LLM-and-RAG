The provided pieces of context do not contain specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that several studies have used machine learning algorithms and satellite images to analyze soil salinity, drought, and other environmental factors. These tasks typically require significant computational power, which is often provided by specialized hardware such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that GPUs or TPUs were used for training the deep learning models in these studies. However, without explicit information, this is just an educated guess.
