The provided context discusses a study on rabbit population dynamics using time series data and Gompertz population models, but it does not directly mention deep learning or strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general strategies for handling randomness in deep learning.

In deep learning, randomness can be introduced through various aspects, such as initial weights, data shuffling, and dropout regularization. Here are some common strategies to handle randomness:

1. **Fixed random seed**: To ensure reproducibility, set a fixed random seed value at the beginning of your code. This ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of random numbers, making your experiments reproducible.

2. **Initial weights**: In deep learning models, initial weights are often randomly initialized. This helps break symmetry and allows the model to learn different features. Common initialization techniques include Xavier initialization and He initialization.

3. **Data shuffling**: Shuffling the training dataset before each epoch can help prevent overfitting and ensure that the model learns from different data patterns.

4. **Dropout regularization**: Dropout is a technique used to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out (i.e., setting to zero) a proportion of neurons during training. This helps the model generalize better.

5. **Batch normalization**: Batch normalization standardizes and normalizes the inputs of each layer, reducing the internal covariate shift. It also introduces randomness by sampling from a mini-batch during training.

6. **Early stopping**: Early stopping is a technique used to prevent overfitting by monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training. Training is stopped when the performance on the validation set starts to degrade.

While the provided context does not discuss deep learning or randomness strategies, these strategies can be applied when working with deep learning pipelines.
