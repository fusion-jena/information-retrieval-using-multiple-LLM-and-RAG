Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, we can infer that the researchers worked with land use/cover data, which is likely in raster format, and time-series data related to grassland stability nationwide and in nine river basins in China.

Land use/cover data is a crucial component of the study, and it was acquired from the Resource and Environmental Science Data Center (RESDC) with a spatial resolution of 1 km Ã— 1 km. This dataset spans the years 1980 to 2018 and covers six major land use/cover categories and twenty-six subcategories. The researchers reclassified the land use/cover types into six classes: cultivated land, forestland, grassland, construction land, water area, and unused land.

Moreover, the study examines grassland stability nationwide and in nine river basins. The researchers analyzed the grassland stability change trend using a Grassland Stability Numerical Index (GSN) and investigated the contributions of climate change and human activities to GSN in areas with unchanged forest and grassland percentages. This time-series data is likely in a structured format, such as CSV, for the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it is possible to infer that the researchers worked with raster data for land use/cover and time-series data for grassland stability, likely in raster and CSV formats, respectively.
