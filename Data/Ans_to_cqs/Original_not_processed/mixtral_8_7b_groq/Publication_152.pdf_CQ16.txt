Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the U-Net model. However, it does mention that data augmentation was used to improve results, which suggests that some form of validation or testing was used to evaluate the model's performance.

In general, training of deep learning models like U-Net can be considered complete when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly. This means that the model's performance on a separate validation set is not improving even after further training, indicating that the model has likely learned the underlying patterns in the training data.

Other criteria that can be used to determine training completion include early stopping, where training is halted if the validation loss starts to increase, or monitoring other metrics such as accuracy or F1 score. The specific criteria used can depend on the problem at hand and the desired trade-off between model performance and training time.

In the context of the article, it is possible that the authors used a combination of validation loss plateauing and early stopping to determine when training was complete. However, this is not explicitly stated in the provided text.
