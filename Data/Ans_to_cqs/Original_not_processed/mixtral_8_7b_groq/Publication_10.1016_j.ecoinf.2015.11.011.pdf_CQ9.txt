Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study "Challenges and opportunities in synthesizing historical geospatial data using statistical models" published in Ecological Informatics. The study does mention the use of various tools and methods for processing and analyzing geospatial data, but it does not specify where the data or the deep learning pipeline related to the study is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
