Answer:::

The provided context discusses various techniques used in deep learning for image classification, object detection, and age estimation, but it does not explicitly mention the strategies for addressing data bias during preprocessing. However, it does mention some techniques that can be used to manage data bias indirectly.

One such technique is data augmentation, which is used to increase the size of the training set and prevent overfitting. Data augmentation techniques include random horizontal flipping, as mentioned in the study by Jarman et al. (2021). This technique can help increase the diversity of the training set and reduce bias by creating new samples from existing ones.

Another technique is the use of pre-trained models, which can help reduce bias by leveraging knowledge from large-scale datasets. For instance, the study by Jarman et al. (2021) pre-trained their model on the ImageNet dataset before fine-tuning it on their PAD Full and PAD Lite datasets. This approach can help ensure that the model has seen a wide variety of images before being trained on the specific task at hand.

The study by Ito et al. (2018) used DNA methylation to estimate the age of chimpanzees, which can be seen as a way to collect diverse data. By using a different type of data, they were able to avoid some of the biases that might be present in traditional image-based methods.

In addition, the study by Jalal et al. (2020) used temporal information to improve fish detection and species classification in underwater environments. This approach can help reduce bias by taking into account the temporal context of the data, which can be important in many real-world applications.

While the provided context does not mention specific strategies such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling, these techniques can be used to manage data bias in deep learning pipelines. Stratified splitting can help ensure that the training and testing sets have similar distributions of labels, while oversampling and undersampling can help manage class imbalance.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for addressing data bias during preprocessing, it does mention techniques such as data augmentation, pre-trained models, diverse data collection, and temporal information that can be used to manage data bias indirectly. Additionally, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling can be used to manage data bias directly.
