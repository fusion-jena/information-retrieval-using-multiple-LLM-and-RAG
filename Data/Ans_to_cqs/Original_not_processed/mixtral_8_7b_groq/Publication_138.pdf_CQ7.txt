Answer:
The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not specified in the provided context. The context focuses on describing the architecture of a deep learning model, specifically the ICSNet, which is a modified version of GoogLeNet. It includes several layers such as convolution layers, local response normalization (LRN), pooling, dropout, fully connected layers, and Softmax activation function layers. However, it does not mention any details about the data splitting criteria.

In general, data splitting for deep learning model training involves dividing the available data into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters and prevent overfitting, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

The most common data splitting ratio is 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. However, the ratio can vary depending on the size and complexity of the data. In some cases, a stratified sampling method is used to ensure that each subset has a similar distribution of classes.

Therefore, while the provided context does not mention the specific criteria used for data splitting, it is an essential step in deep learning model training to ensure the model's generalization and prevent overfitting.
