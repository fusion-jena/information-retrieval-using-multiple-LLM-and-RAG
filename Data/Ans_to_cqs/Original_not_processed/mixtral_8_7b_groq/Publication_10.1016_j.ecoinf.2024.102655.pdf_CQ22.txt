The provided context discusses the evaluation of machine learning models, specifically ANFIS, ANN, and SVM, using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Square Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2) metrics. However, it does not directly mention the performance evaluation of a deep learning model or accuracy, precision, or recall metrics.

Deep learning models' performance is often evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall. However, the context does not specify which metrics were used for deep learning models.

To summarize, the provided context does not contain information on the evaluation metrics used for deep learning models, so I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.
