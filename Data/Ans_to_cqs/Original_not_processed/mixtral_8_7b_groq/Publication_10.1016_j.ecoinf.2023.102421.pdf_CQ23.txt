Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the study did not involve a deep learning model. Instead, it focused on optimizing hyperparameters for machine learning models XGBoost and LightGBM using Bayesian optimizers and Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TDO) with 10-fold cross-validation. However, I can still provide information on measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the machine learning models used in the study.

To ensure the generalizability of the machine learning models, the study divided the training dataset into two parts, using 80% for training/validation and keeping the remaining 20% as unseen data for testing. This approach helps in evaluating the model's performance on unseen data, ensuring that the model can generalize well to new, unseen data.

Additionally, the study employed 10-fold cross-validation during the training process. Cross-validation is a powerful technique to improve the model's performance and prevent overfitting. In 10-fold cross-validation, the training data is divided into 10 subsets, or folds. The model is trained on 9 folds while the remaining fold is used for validation. This process is repeated 10 times, with each fold used once for validation. The final performance is then calculated as the average performance across all 10 folds.

The study also used mean RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) as the objective function (loss function) during hyperparameter optimization. RMSE is a common metric for regression problems and provides an estimate of the difference between the predicted and actual values. By minimizing the RMSE, the study aimed to find the set of hyperparameters that would result in the best generalization performance.

Lastly, the study tested the differences between the RMSEs of different optimizer combinations using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test with paired samples. This test helped identify whether the performance differences between different optimizer combinations were statistically significant, further ensuring the generalizability of the models.

In summary, although the study did not involve deep learning models, it took several measures to ensure the generalizability of the machine learning models used. These measures include using a separate test dataset, employing 10-fold cross-validation, minimizing the RMSE as the objective function, and testing the statistical significance of performance differences between different optimizer combinations.
