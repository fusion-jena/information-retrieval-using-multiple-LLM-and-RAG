Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning for analyzing remote sensing imagery, but it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. However, it does touch upon the importance of data set balance and the impact of mini-batch size on learning from different classes. Based on this information and general knowledge of preprocessing techniques used in machine learning, I can provide some relevant information.

In the context of deep learning, data bias can occur when certain classes or groups are overrepresented or underrepresented in the training data. This can lead to poor model performance and inaccurate predictions. To address data bias, several preprocessing techniques can be employed:

1. Stratified sampling: During the splitting of the data into training, validation, and test sets, this method ensures that each subset maintains the original data's class distribution. This helps prevent overfitting or underfitting specific classes.

2. Oversampling: When a particular class is underrepresented, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from that class. This can be done either by replicating existing instances or by generating synthetic samples using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).

3. Undersampling: Conversely, when a class is overrepresented, undersampling can be employed to reduce the number of instances from that class. This can be done randomly or by using more sophisticated methods that retain important information.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting a diverse and balanced dataset is crucial for reducing data bias. This involves gathering data from various sources, locations, and conditions to ensure that the model is exposed to a wide range of examples.

While the provided context does not explicitly discuss these techniques, it does highlight the importance of understanding the data and carefully selecting and manipulating training images to influence the network's learning. This aligns with the general principle of diverse data collection and careful preprocessing to minimize data bias.
