Based on the provided context, the specific purpose of the deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) in the landslide susceptibility modeling (LSM) context is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that these models are being considered for classification tasks.

In the context, it is mentioned that these models will be compared with ensemble techniques like XGBoost in the future, "pending data availability." The XGBoost model is used for various tasks, including classification and regression, and it is designed to handle diverse machine learning tasks. Similarly, CNN and RCNN are types of deep learning models primarily used for classification and segmentation tasks in various fields, including image processing and computer vision.

Therefore, it can be inferred that in the LSM context, these deep learning models will likely be used for classifying landslide-prone areas or segments of the study area. This classification could involve distinguishing between areas with high and low landslide susceptibility or identifying specific locations at risk of landslides.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly state the purpose of the deep learning models in LSM, it can be inferred that they will be used for classification tasks, distinguishing between landslide-prone and safe areas based on various input data and features.
