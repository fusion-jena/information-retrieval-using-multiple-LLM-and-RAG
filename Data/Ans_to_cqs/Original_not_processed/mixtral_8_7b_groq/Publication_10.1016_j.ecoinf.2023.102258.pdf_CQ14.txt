Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization methods. The context focuses on describing the performance of different systems and methods in few-shot learning, particularly in the case of transductive few-shot learning, where unlabeled examples from the query set are used to adapt the model and improve its predictions.

The systems mentioned, such as Wu_SHNU, Liu_Surrey, Martinsson_RISE, Zgorzynski_SRPOL, Liu_BIT-SRCB, Willbo_RISE, and XuQianHu_NUDT_BIT, each have their unique approaches to improve few-shot learning performance. For instance, Wu_SHNU uses an unchanging feature extraction with a query-time adaptive weighting, while Liu_Surrey optimizes the contrast between positive events and negative prototypes and adapts segment length based on each target class. Other systems like Martinsson_RISE, Zgorzynski_SRPOL, Liu_BIT-SRCB, and Willbo_RISE address the problem of different lengths of events across target classes using ensemble approaches or multi-scale/wide ResNets. However, the context does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of these models were optimized.
