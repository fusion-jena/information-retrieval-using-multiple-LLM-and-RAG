The provided context does not give information about the specific deep learning framework used to build the model. The text describes the architecture of a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying anuran calls, including details about the number of filters, kernel size, fully connected layer, and softmax layer. It also mentions the training strategy and resource usage, but it does not specify the framework. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query based on the given context.
