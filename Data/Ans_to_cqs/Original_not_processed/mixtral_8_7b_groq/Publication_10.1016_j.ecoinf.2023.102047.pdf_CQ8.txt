Answer:::
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include any information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various deep learning models and techniques used for seagrass coverage estimation and mapping, but it does not mention where the code for these models can be found. It is possible that the code has not been made publicly available, or it may be hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. I recommend reaching out to the authors of the studies for more information.
