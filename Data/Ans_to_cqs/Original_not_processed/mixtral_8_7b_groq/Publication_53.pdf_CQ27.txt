Based on the provided context, the process of deploying the trained deep learning model seems to be mostly implicit, but some steps can be inferred.

Firstly, the model was trained using the fastai library in Python. The model used is a ResNet34 model that was pre-trained on ImageNet data and then fine-tuned on a labeled dataset of 400 images of farm dams or not farm dams. The model was trained for ten epochs with a batch size of 300 images and a learning rate of 10âˆ’3. Data augmentation was used to help generalize the model.

After training, the model was used to classify 500 images from the unlabeled training dataset, and the predictions were manually checked and corrected. This process of training, classification, and checking was repeated until all 7362 images were labeled.

However, the context does not explicitly mention any steps taken for model serialization or platform selection. Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model in a format that can be easily loaded and used for making predictions. Platform selection refers to choosing the hardware and software environment where the model will be deployed.

Given that the model was built using Python and fastai, it is possible that the trained model was saved using the Python pickle module or the fastai save\_model function. As for platform selection, the context does not provide enough information to determine where the model was deployed. It is possible that the model was deployed on a local machine, a server, or a cloud platform.

Therefore, while some steps can be inferred from the provided context, the full process of deploying the trained deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned.
