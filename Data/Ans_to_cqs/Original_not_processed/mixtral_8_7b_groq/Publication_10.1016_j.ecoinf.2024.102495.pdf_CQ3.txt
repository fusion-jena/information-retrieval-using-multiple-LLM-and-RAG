Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the study focuses on voice feature extraction using a deep learning algorithm, particularly a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), for mosquito sound classification.

In the context, the feature extraction process is automatically performed through a convolution process in the CNN, which applies a convolution kernel to the input data and pooling. This process reduces the spatial size of data representation. For voice-recorded data, a visual representation of the sound in the form of a spectrogram is generated, which is then used as input for the CNN.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the data annotation technique used in this study is related to spectrogram generation, which is a visual representation of the audio signal's amplitude over time. Spectrograms are often used as input for deep learning models in audio processing tasks, such as speech recognition, music information retrieval, and sound event detection.

In spectrogram generation, the audio signal is divided into short overlapping windows, and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is applied to each window to obtain the frequency spectrum. The frequency spectrum is then represented as a heatmap, where the color intensity corresponds to the amplitude of each frequency at a given time.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that spectrogram generation is used as input for the CNN in the voice feature extraction process.
