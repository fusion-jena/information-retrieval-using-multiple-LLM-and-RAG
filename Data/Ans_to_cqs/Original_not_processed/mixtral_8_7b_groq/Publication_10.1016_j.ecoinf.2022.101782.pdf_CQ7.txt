Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it does mention that the model performance was evaluated based on an independent test set of 2060 images, which suggests that a test set was used in addition to a training set. Furthermore, the best model was selected based on the minimal validation loss that occurred at epoch 448, implying that a validation set was also used in the training process.

In general, when training deep learning models, it is common to split the data into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model performance. The exact criteria used to split the data can vary depending on the specific use case and the amount of available data.

In the context of this study, it is possible that a random split was used to divide the data into training, validation, and testing sets. Alternatively, a stratified split may have been used to ensure that each set contained a representative sample of the data. However, without further information, it is not possible to determine the exact criteria used to split the data in this study.
