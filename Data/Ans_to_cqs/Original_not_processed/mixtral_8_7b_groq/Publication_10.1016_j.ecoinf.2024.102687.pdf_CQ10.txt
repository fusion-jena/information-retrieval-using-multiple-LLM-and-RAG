Answer:::
I am unable to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline as it was not included in the context. However, based on the information provided, it is clear that the researchers conducted experiments using pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) backbones (ResNet18, VGG16, DenseNet121, and AlexNet) on the Darksound dataset. They fine-tuned these models using Matching Networks (MN), Prototypical Networks (PN), and Relation Networks (RN) for 5 way-5 shot tasks.

The context also mentions that using features extracted from a model trained on spectrograms of bird sounds could improve the parameter initialization of UML algorithms of the MEC method. This suggests that the researchers might have used or created a custom deep learning pipeline involving these specific modifications.

To explore the code repository, you can look for repositories associated with the authors or the affiliated institutions (Ecological Informatics82, 2024; J. Poutaraud et al.) on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. You can also search for repositories related to the specific deep learning techniques and datasets mentioned in the context, such as Matching Networks, Prototypical Networks, Relation Networks, and Darksound dataset.

An example search query for GitHub could be:
"Ecological Informatics82 OR Poutaraud OR Darksound OR Matching Networks OR Prototypical Networks OR Relation Networks"

Please note that the code repository might not be publicly available due to various reasons, such as ongoing research, data privacy, or other institutional policies.
