Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the deep learning model used in this study is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) commonly used for time series data prediction.

The LSTM model was trained and compared with other models such as the Backpropagation (BP) model and the Markov chain model for predicting time series data. The study used the LSTM model to predict land use change, but the context does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed or implemented in a production environment.

Therefore, it can be assumed that the model serialization and platform selection processes were not covered in the given context. Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model's architecture, weights, and biases to a file, allowing it to be loaded and used for making predictions in a production environment. Platform selection involves choosing the appropriate hardware and software infrastructure for deploying the model, such as a cloud-based platform or an on-premises server.

In summary, while the context provides information on the training and comparison of the LSTM model, it does not explicitly mention the process followed for deploying the trained deep learning model.
