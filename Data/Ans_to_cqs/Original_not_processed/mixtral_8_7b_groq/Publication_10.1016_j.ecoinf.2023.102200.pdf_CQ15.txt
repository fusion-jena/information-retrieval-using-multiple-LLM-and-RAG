Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning techniques in remote sensing and geospatial analysis, specifically for tasks such as object detection and segmentation in unmanned aerial systems (UAS) imagery and LiDAR data. However, not all of the sources go into detail about the optimization techniques used in their deep learning pipelines.

One source that does provide some information on optimization techniques is the study by Martins et al. (2021), which uses a Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) algorithm for tree canopies segmentation in urban areas. During the detector operation, the Faster R-CNN network with a Resnet-101 backend was trained for 20,000 iterations using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with a learning rate of 0.003, momentum of 0.9, and a batch size of 1. The network was initialized with weights developed from training based on the MS COCO dataset.

Another source that mentions an optimization technique is the study by Chen et al. (2021), which uses a PointNet of deep learning for individual tree crown segmentation directly from UAV-borne LiDAR data. However, it does not provide specific details about the optimization technique used.

In addition, the study by Chen et al. (2023) mentions the use of high spatial resolution UAV images for the classification of wetland vegetation species and ground objects, but it does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the provided context suggests that Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is used as an optimization technique in the deep learning pipeline for object detection and segmentation tasks in remote sensing and geospatial analysis. However, other optimization techniques such as Adam, RMSprop, etc. are not mentioned in the provided context.
