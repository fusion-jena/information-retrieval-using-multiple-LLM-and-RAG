Based on the information provided, the criteria used to determine when training is complete is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that one of the criteria might be related to the number of iterations or reaching a certain point in the learning process.

In section 3.2, it is mentioned that the accuracy and loss curves are presented in Figure 11. The figure shows the performance of different methods, including FCN, UNet, SegNet, DCNN, and DeepLabV3+, in terms of accuracy and loss over 100,000 iterations or half of the learning process. It can be inferred that the training may be considered complete when the methods have reached a stable state, and the loss has either plateaued or reached its minimum value.

For instance, the FCN, UNet, and SegNet methods performed similarly with stable slight variation and close to the minimum loss value after 100,00
