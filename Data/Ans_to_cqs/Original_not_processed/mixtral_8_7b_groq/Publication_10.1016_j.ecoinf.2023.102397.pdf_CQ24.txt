Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, some of the studies mentioned use machine learning models and techniques that implicitly handle randomness.

Breiman (2001) introduced Random Forests, a machine learning model based on decision trees. Random Forests handle randomness by building multiple decision trees using bootstrap samples of the training data and selecting a subset of features for splitting at each node. This process reduces overfitting and improves the generalization of the model. However, the context does not specify whether a random seed value was set during the implementation of the Random Forest model in the Arbimon platform.

Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020) analyzed the effects of sample size and network depth on a deep learning approach to species distribution modeling. They used neural networks, which can be sensitive to randomness due to the initialization of weights and biases. Although the paper does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, they emphasized the importance of increasing the number of hidden layers (network depth) and training recordings (sample size) to improve the performance of the model. This approach can implicitly help in handling the randomness associated with neural networks.

Brumm (2006) studied signalling through acoustic windows in nightingales, but the study does not involve deep learning or machine learning techniques. Therefore, there is no discussion of handling randomness in this context.

Brown et al. (2019) focused on automatic rain and cicada chorus filtering of bird acoustic data. While they used software tools for filtering, there is no mention of deep learning or machine learning techniques, and thus, no discussion of handling randomness.

Bicudo et al. (2023) investigated the poor performance of acoustic indices as proxies for bird diversity in a fragmented Amazonian landscape. They used statistical methods for data analysis, but there is no mention of deep learning or machine learning techniques, so the question of handling randomness does not arise in this context.

In summary, while some of the studies mentioned use machine learning models that implicitly handle randomness, there is no explicit discussion of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value.
