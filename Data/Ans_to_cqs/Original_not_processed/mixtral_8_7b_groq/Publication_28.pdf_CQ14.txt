The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the IKHO (Improved Krill Herd) algorithm. The IKHO algorithm is a swarm-based optimization approach inspired by the swarming behavior of krills in a particular environmental and biological process. It integrates the KH algorithm with a free search (FS) operator to avoid the local optimal problem of the KH algorithm.

The KH algorithm uses a Lagrangian approach in a d-dimension decision space, where the motion of a krill individual is influenced by other krills, foraging action, and arbitrary diffusion. The movement of a krill individual is determined by the local and target outcomes and can be defined using Eq. (2) in the context.

The IKHO algorithm is used to optimally adjust the hyperparameters of the EfficientNet model in the PTDLEN-VAE (Progressive Transformation Learning with Dynamic Length-based Attention for Variational Auto-Encoder) model. The EfficientNet model is used as a feature extractor in the PTDLEN-VAE model, and the IKHO algorithm helps to enhance the prediction outcome of the PTDLEN-VAE model for unseen data.

The use of the IKHO algorithm for hyperparameter optimization is a significant contribution of the paper as it helps to avoid the local optimal problem of the KH algorithm and optimally adjust the hyperparameters of the EfficientNet model. The optimization of hyperparameters is crucial for the performance of the model, and the use of the IKHO algorithm in the PTDLEN-VAE model highlights its importance.

Therefore, the hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the IKHO algorithm, which is a swarm-based optimization approach inspired by the swarming behavior of krills. The IKHO algorithm integrates the KH algorithm with a free search operator to avoid the local optimal problem of the KH algorithm and optimally adjust the hyperparameters of the EfficientNet model in the PTDLEN-VAE model.
