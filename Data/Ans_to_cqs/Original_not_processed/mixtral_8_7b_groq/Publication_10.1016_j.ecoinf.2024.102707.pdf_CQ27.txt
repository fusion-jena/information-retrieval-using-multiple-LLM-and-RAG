Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized into a format that could be easily shared and loaded onto a different platform for use.

In general, when deploying a deep learning model, there are several steps that are typically followed. First, the model is trained on a large dataset, and then it is evaluated on a separate validation dataset to ensure that it is performing well. Once the model has been trained and validated, it is often serialized using a format such as JSON or XML, which allows it to be easily shared and loaded onto a different platform.

In the context of the studies provided, it is likely that the trained deep learning model was serialized and then loaded onto a platform for use in analyzing aerial imagery of animals. For example, in the study by Witharana and Lynch (2016), an object-based image analysis approach was used to detect penguin guano in very high spatial resolution satellite images. It is possible that a deep learning model was trained on a large dataset of labeled penguin guano images and then deployed to analyze new satellite images.

Similarly, in the study by Wood et al. (2021), the accuracy and precision of citizen scientist animal counts from drone imagery were evaluated. In this study, it is possible that a deep learning model was trained on a large dataset of labeled animal images and then deployed to analyze new drone images.

Overall, while there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model in the provided context, it is likely that the model was serialized and then loaded onto a platform for use in analyzing aerial imagery of animals.
