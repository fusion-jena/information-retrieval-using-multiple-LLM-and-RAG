Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of a stratified sampling method and error statistics. Specifically, a stratified sampling method was applied to all aboveground biomass (AGB) observations, randomly allocating 70% of the samples to the training dataset and the remaining 30% to the validation dataset. This approach ensures that the training and validation datasets are representative of the entire population of AGB observations.

Three error statistics, namely R-squared (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE), were employed to compare the accuracies of the models. These error statistics provide insights into the model's performance by measuring the difference between the predicted and observed AGB values. R2 measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable (AGB) that is predictable from the independent variables. MAE measures the average magnitude of the errors in the predicted AGB values, while RMSE measures the standard deviation of the prediction errors.

Moreover, to prevent overfitting, a regularization parameter (c) was used in the Support Vector Machine model to optimize the line fit and penalize the number of samples inside the margin. The value of c was optimized during the model training process to find the best model fit.

In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of a stratified sampling method, error statistics, and regularization techniques. These methods ensure that the model's performance is monitored during training, preventing overfitting and ensuring that the model's predictions are accurate and reliable.
