Answer:::

The provided context does not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does describe the use of the Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) neural network approach, which is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm used for dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis.

While the SOFM algorithm can help objectively classify ecosystem functions and uncover the dominant service functions and ecological values of land-use types, it does not explicitly address the issue of randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, strategies to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines can include:

1. Setting a random seed value: This ensures that the random number generator used in the algorithm produces the same sequence of random numbers, allowing for reproducibility of results.
2. Data augmentation: This technique involves creating new training examples by applying random transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, scaling, or flipping. This can help improve model performance and reduce overfitting.
3. Regularization: Techniques such as dropout, weight decay, or early stopping can help prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.
4. Ensemble methods: These methods involve training multiple models and combining their predictions to improve overall performance. This can help reduce the impact of randomness in individual models.

While the provided context does not discuss these specific strategies, it is important to consider these and other approaches when implementing deep learning pipelines to ensure robust and reproducible results.
