The provided context does not include specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the deep learning models were trained on panda facial images and that aggressive data augmentation was applied. Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by applying various transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping. This can help improve the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

In the context of computer vision, some common data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This involves drawing a bounding box around an object of interest in an image. It is a simple and efficient way to label objects and is often used for object detection tasks.
2. Semantic segmentation: This is the process of dividing an image into multiple segments or regions, where each region corresponds to a specific object or class. It is a more detailed form of annotation than bounding box annotation and is often used for image segmentation tasks.
3. Instance segmentation: This is similar to semantic segmentation, but it also distinguishes between individual instances of an object. For example, in an image of a group of people, instance segmentation would not only label the pixels corresponding to each person, but it would also assign a unique identifier to each individual.
4. Landmark annotation: This involves identifying and labeling key points or landmarks on an object, such as the corners of a bounding box or the eyes and mouth of a face. It is often used for tasks such as facial recognition and pose estimation.

It is possible that one or more of these data annotation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context, but the specific techniques are not mentioned.
