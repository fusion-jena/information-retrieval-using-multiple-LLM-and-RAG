In the context provided, the specific deep learning models or techniques used for fish biomass estimation do not include any regularization methods to prevent overfitting. However, I can provide a general answer regarding regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines.

Regularization methods are essential in deep learning to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Two common regularization techniques in deep learning are dropout and L2 regularization.

1. Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique introduced by Geoffrey Hinton and his colleagues (Srivastava et al., 2014). During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction of neurons in a layer to zero, preventing the model from relying too much on specific neurons. This leads to a more robust and generalized model. Dropout can be applied to any layer in the deep learning model, but it is most commonly used in fully connected layers.

2. L2 Regularization: L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function, proportional to the sum of squares of all model weights. This encourages smaller weights, reducing the complexity of the model and making it less prone to overfitting. L2 regularization is applied during the optimization process and affects all model weights.

While the text does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization in the fish biomass estimation deep learning pipeline, it is essential to consider these techniques when developing deep learning models to prevent overfitting and improve their generalization performance.

Answer:::
Regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization are used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of neurons in a layer to zero during training, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, encouraging smaller weights. Although the provided context does not mention the use of these techniques in fish biomass estimation, they are crucial for developing robust and generalized deep learning models.
