Answer:

The purpose of the deep learning model used in the study by Chistopolova et al. (2019) is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the mentioned algorithm training using data from captive Amur tigers, it can be inferred that the model is used for classification.

In section 3.4 of the provided context, a classification dendrogram was generated using the FIT pairwise comparison model for trails from captive Amur tigers. The model was iterated multiple times to achieve the fewest misclassifications, and it was able to correctly predict 100% of the 44 tigers. This indicates that the model is being used for classification, specifically for classifying tiger trails.

Furthermore, in section 3.5, the sex classification for images and the resulting designations for each trail were made. This again suggests that the deep learning model is being used for classification, this time for determining the sex of the tiger from the collected trails.

It is important to note that the specific type of deep learning model used is not mentioned in the provided context. The model could be a convolutional neural network (CNN), a recurrent neural network (RNN), or any other type of deep learning model.

In summary, based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model used in the study by Chistopolova et al. (2019) is for classification, specifically for classifying tiger trails and determining the sex of the tiger from the collected trails.
