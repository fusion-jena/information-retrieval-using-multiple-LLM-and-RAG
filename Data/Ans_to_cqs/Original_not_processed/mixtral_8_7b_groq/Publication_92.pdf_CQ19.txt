The text provided does not give explicit information about the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the model. However, it does mention the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the training phase involving a database of image-label couples. Both TensorFlow and PyTorch, two popular deep learning frameworks, provide extensive support for building and training CNNs. Therefore, it is plausible that either TensorFlow or PyTorch, or potentially another framework, was used to build the deep learning model in this context.
