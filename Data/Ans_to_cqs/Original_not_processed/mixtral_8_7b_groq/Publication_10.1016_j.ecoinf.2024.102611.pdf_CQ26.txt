Answer:::

The provided context discusses the importance of maintaining consistent ratios across groups in the sampling process to avoid potential bias during classification. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subgroups or "strata" that are representative of the population, and then randomly sampling from each stratum to ensure that each subgroup is proportionally represented in the training, validation, and testing sets.

Oversampling involves increasing the number of samples from underrepresented groups to balance the dataset. Undersampling involves reducing the number of samples from overrepresented groups to balance the dataset.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from a wide range of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help to reduce bias and improve the generalizability of the model.

In the context of the GSL100 dataset, maintaining consistent ratios across groups during the sampling process can help to avoid potential bias during classification. However, it does not explicitly address any preprocessing techniques used to address data bias.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, common techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
