Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model for downscaling forest biomass density. However, the authors of EcologicalInformatics81(2024)10256613 mentioned that additional factors such as population density, ecological engineering, temperature, and precipitation could be incorporated to construct a more comprehensive and accurate downscaling model for forest biomass density. This suggests that the authors may have considered including a diverse dataset and stratified splitting in their methodology.

In the context of estimating forest biomass, Bortolot and Wynne (2005) used small footprint LiDAR data and an individual tree-based approach that incorporates training data. While this methodology does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, the use of training data suggests that some form of cross-validation may have been employed.

Bai and Zang (2007) focused on the phytocoenological characteristics and community classification of Abies fargesii forests in Qinlin Mountains. Their study did not involve the development of a predictive model, so there is no information about measures taken to ensure generalizability.

Bonan (2008) discussed the forcings, feedbacks, and climate benefits of forests, but did not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

Brdaford et al. (2008) studied tree age, disturbance history, and carbon stocks and fluxes in subalpine Rocky Mountain forests. Their study did not involve the development of a predictive model, so there is no information about measures taken to ensure generalizability.

In summary, while some of the provided context suggests that measures such as diverse dataset and stratified splitting may have been taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model for downscaling forest biomass density, there is no explicit information about the specific measures used.
