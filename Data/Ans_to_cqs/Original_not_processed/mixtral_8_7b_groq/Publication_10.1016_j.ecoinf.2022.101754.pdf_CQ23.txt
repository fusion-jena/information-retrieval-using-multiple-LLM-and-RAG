The study mentioned in the context used a training-and-test approach with stratification splitting and cross-validation to ensure the generalizability of the regression models, including the deep learning model. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of a diverse dataset.

In stratification splitting, the data was split into 100 different training-and-test sets, with tuning of the hyperparameter on the training set done for each set. After that, model training was carried out using an optimal setting of the hyperparameter. This approach helps in ensuring that the model performs well on unseen data by evaluating its performance on multiple splits of the data.

Moreover, cross-validation R2 (CV_R2) was used as one of the evaluation metrics, which is a measure of how well a model generalizes to an independent data set. It is calculated by training the model on a subset of the data and testing it on the remaining subset, repeating this process multiple times with different subsets of the data. The average R2 score across all these runs gives the cross-validation R2 score.

However, the context does not mention the use of a diverse dataset, which is another important factor in ensuring the generalizability of a deep learning model. A diverse dataset includes data from different sources, domains, and variations, which helps the model to learn a more generalized representation of the data.

Therefore, while the study used stratification splitting and cross-validation to ensure the generalizability of the regression models, it does not explicitly mention the use of a diverse dataset.
