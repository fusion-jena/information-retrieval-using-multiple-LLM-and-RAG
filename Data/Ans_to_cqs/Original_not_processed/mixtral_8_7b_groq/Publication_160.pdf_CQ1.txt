Answer:::

The provided context does not give explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for coralligenous species identification. However, it can be inferred that the raw data is likely obtained through underwater video recordings or photographic quadrats, as mentioned in the context.

In the study "Underwater video analysis for monitoring coralligenous reefs using neural networks" (Opt. Express 13, 8766), the authors used underwater video recordings for their analysis. Similarly, in the study about coralligenous reef monitoring, the context suggests that photographic quadrats are used for collecting data, as the researchers aim to design an algorithm based on deep CNN architectures to identify coralligenous species or their broader taxonomical group from annotated photographic quadrats.

Additionally, other studies mentioned in the context use public datasets for training and evaluating their deep learning models. For instance, the study "Systematic evaluation of CNN advances on the ImageNet" (Comput. Vis. Image Underst. 161, 11â€“19) uses the ImageNet dataset for their evaluation. However, it is not clear if these public datasets were used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for coralligenous species identification.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data, it can be inferred that underwater video recordings and photographic quadrats are likely used for coralligenous species identification. Additionally, public datasets might be used for training and evaluating deep learning models, but their role in raw data collection is uncertain.
