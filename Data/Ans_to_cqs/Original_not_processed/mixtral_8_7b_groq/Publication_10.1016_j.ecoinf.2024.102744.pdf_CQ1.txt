The context provided does not give specific details about how raw data is collected in the deep learning pipeline for bee image classification and pollen-bearing bee detection. However, it does mention the use of the VnPollenBee dataset, which implies that the data was collected and prepared before being used in the deep learning models.

In general, raw data for deep learning tasks can be collected through various methods, including but not limited to:

1. Surveys: Collecting data through questionnaires or interviews to gather information from human respondents.
2. Sensors: Using sensors to gather data from the environment, such as temperature, humidity, or image data.
3. Public datasets: Using publicly available datasets that have been collected and prepared by other researchers or organizations.

For bee image classification and pollen-bearing bee detection, raw data might be collected using cameras or drones to capture images of bees in their natural habitat. These images could then be used as input for deep learning models.

It is also possible that the raw data was collected through a combination of methods. For example, surveys could be used to gather information about the location and behavior of bees, and sensors could be used to capture images of the bees in real-time. These images could then be added to a public dataset for use by other researchers.

Overall, while the context does not provide specific details about how raw data was collected for bee image classification and pollen-bearing bee detection, it is likely that a combination of methods was used to gather the necessary data.
