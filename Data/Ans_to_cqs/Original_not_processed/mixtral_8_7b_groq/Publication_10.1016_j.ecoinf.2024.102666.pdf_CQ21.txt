Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training for the Case 2 Regional Coast Color (C2RCC) processor. The text focuses on the input parameters considered by the C2RCC processor, such as lake salinity, temperature, ozone, atmospheric pressure, and elevation data. It also mentions that the processor uses Artificial Neural Network (ANN) training to identify the radiation brightness of the top layer of the atmosphere and obtain the reflectance of the water after atmospheric correction (AC).

However, it does not mention any specific postprocessing steps like Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. Saliency maps are often used to highlight the important features in the input data that the model has learned to focus on during training. Metrics calculation involves evaluating the performance of the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It can show the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query. It is possible that the developers of the C2RCC processor have not specified these postprocessing steps in the text or they might be using different postprocessing techniques.
