Based on the provided context, the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated. The text focuses on the construction and validation of a three-layer backpropagation artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting Total Suspended Solids (TSI) using aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) as inputs. It also discusses the use of the LASSO model for variable selection and statistical regularization in a different context.

However, it is important to note that the backpropagation algorithm itself is a widely used optimization technique in deep learning. In this process, the weights of the neural network are updated in the opposite direction of the gradient of the loss function, which is the difference between the predicted and actual values. This gradient descent method is used to minimize the error and optimize the model's performance.

In addition, there are various optimization algorithms that can be used within the backpropagation algorithm, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad. These optimization algorithms can help to improve the speed, efficiency, and robustness of the learning process. However, the provided context does not mention any specific optimization algorithm other than the backpropagation algorithm itself.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated in the provided context, but it can be inferred that the backpropagation algorithm is used, and there is a possibility of using other optimization algorithms within it.
