Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. However, it can be inferred that the data splitting approach was not the main focus of the study.

The study primarily concentrated on fuel model retrieval using deep learning models trained with synthetic data and validated with real MS point clouds. They trained the SoftGroup architecture for 1000 epochs for each type of input data and computed metrics like MIoU or MA after each epoch to analyze the training performance. After training, they selected the configuration weights that achieved the best classification performance to establish the reference trained model. This model was then used to perform predictions on the real MS point clouds collected in Section 2.3, i.e., the ground truth data.

In summary, the provided context does not offer information on the criteria used for splitting the data into train, test, and validation sets.
