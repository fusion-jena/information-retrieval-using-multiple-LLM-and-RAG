Answer:

The provided context does not give information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning models. The sources mention various models such as BirdNet, VGGish, YAMNet, VGG16, and ResNet152-V2, and where they were evaluated (e.g., on focal and citizen-science datasets), but they do not specify the platform used for deployment.
