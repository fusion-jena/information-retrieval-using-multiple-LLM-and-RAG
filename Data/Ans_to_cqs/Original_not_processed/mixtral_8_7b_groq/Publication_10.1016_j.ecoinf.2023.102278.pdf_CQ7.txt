Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the TLm and GBIFm datasets are split for training and validation purposes.

For the TLm dataset, approximately 16% of the data is used for validation, while the remaining 84% is used for training. Similarly, for the GBIFm dataset, around 20% of the data is used for validation, and the remaining 80% is used for training.

It is worth noting that the specific method used for splitting the data, such as random sampling or stratified sampling, is not mentioned. Additionally, there is no information provided on whether any part of the data is used as a test set.

Therefore, while the context provides information on the approximate percentage of data used for training and validation, it does not provide specific criteria for splitting the data.
