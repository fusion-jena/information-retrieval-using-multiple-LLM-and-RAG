Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several research papers and an article abstract that discuss the use of remote sensing data, machine learning, and deep learning techniques for estimating water quality parameters such as chlorophyll-a, total suspended solids, and secchi disk depth. However, none of these sources mention or provide a link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline.

It's possible that the data repository link is not publicly available or was not included in the provided context. If you need access to the data or more information about the deep learning pipeline, I would recommend contacting the authors of the relevant research papers or the article for further assistance.
