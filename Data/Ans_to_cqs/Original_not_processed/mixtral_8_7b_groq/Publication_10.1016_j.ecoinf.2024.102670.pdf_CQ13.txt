The provided context does not give specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. It mentions the use of a deep learning-based model in Guo et al. (2021) for classifying points of interest in 3D volumetric images but does not specify the learning rate, optimizer, or any other hyperparameters.

However, it does mention that Guo et al. (2021) extracted spherical patches around points of interest and used a deep learning model to classify the point of interest. It also mentions that the approach is similar to their own approach in that it creates an overview and then locally analyzes the points of interest.

Additionally, the context discusses the tuning of parameters in other studies, such as binarization thresholds τ1 and τ2 in Vidal-Diez de Ulzurrun et al. (2019) and the parameter κ in Wang et al. (2019). However, these are not hyperparameters of a deep learning model but rather parameters specific to the methods used in those studies.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we cannot provide specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
