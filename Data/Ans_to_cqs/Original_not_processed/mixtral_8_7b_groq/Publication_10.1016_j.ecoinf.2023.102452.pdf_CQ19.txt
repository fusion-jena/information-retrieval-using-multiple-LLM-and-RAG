Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) used to build the models. However, it is mentioned that a FORTRAN platform was chosen for its computational capabilities in Quilty and Adamowski (2018). Additionally, a study by Dehghani et al. (2023) compares LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM for hourly short-term streamflow forecasting using deep learning approaches, but it does not specify the deep learning framework used.

Furthermore, some studies mentioned in the context use custom-built or specific algorithms for their models, such as the Wavelet Network Model by Wang and Ding (2003), Discrete Gabor Transform by Qian and Chen (1993), and the data-driven multi-model methodology with deep feature selection for short-term wind forecasting by Feng et al. (2017).

In summary, while the context provides information on various models and algorithms used in forecasting and deep learning, it does not explicitly mention the use of popular deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
