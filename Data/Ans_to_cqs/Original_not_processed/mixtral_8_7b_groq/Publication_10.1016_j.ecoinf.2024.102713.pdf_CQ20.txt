Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model in the CASE project. The text focuses on the data sources, integration and enrichment processes, validation and loading processes, and analytical fruition of the CASE database and related monitoring network. It does not mention any details about the hardware resources used for training machine learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query.
