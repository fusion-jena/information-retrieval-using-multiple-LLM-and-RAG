Answer:::

The context provided does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of deep learning techniques for fish biomass estimation, particularly in turbid environments, and mentions the use of datasets for training deep learning models. However, it does not specify where these datasets are stored or how they can be accessed. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
