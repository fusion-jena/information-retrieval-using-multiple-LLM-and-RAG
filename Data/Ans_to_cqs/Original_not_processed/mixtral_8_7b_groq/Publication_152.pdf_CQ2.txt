Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of images in a deep learning pipeline, specifically with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In [16], a CNN was used to analyze crop images for predicting crop production. Another work [17] utilized CNNs to quantify the number of citrus trees in an orchard. Furthermore, [23] employed an improved U-Net to identify and grade maize drought on RGB images of UAVs. These examples demonstrate that image data formats are commonly used in deep learning pipelines involving CNNs.

Additionally, [25] discusses the accuracy of orthomosaics generated by different methods using a UAV platform, which implies the use of image data in the deep learning pipeline. [26] introduces a data augmentation technique called Random Image Cropping and Patching (RICAP) for deep CNNs, which also indicates the use of image data.

However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that image data formats are used in deep learning pipelines, particularly with CNNs.

Answer:::

In summary, the provided context indicates that image data formats are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, particularly with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, there is no explicit mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the context.
