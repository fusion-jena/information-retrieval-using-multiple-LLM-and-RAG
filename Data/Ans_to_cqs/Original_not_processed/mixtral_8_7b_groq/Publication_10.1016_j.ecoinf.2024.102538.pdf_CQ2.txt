Answer:::

Deep learning models can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific problem and the type of data available.

In the context of bird sound recognition, a common data format used is audio. Researchers often convert bird sounds into 2-D mel-scale spectrograms, which are then used as input to deep learning models. This format allows for the application of advanced image recognition techniques for automatic feature learning.

For instance, Kahl et al. (2021a, 2022, 2023) demonstrated the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with residual connections in recognizing bird sounds using mel-scale spectrograms. Similarly, Sevilla and Glotin (2017) used Inception V4 with time and time-frequency attention mechanisms to achieve first place in the BirdCLEF 2017 Competition.

However, deep learning models can also handle other data formats. For example, in the LifeCLEF Bird Identification Challenge, images of birds are used as input to deep learning models for automatic feature learning. These models typically use advanced image recognition techniques adapted from CNN architectures.

In addition, deep learning models can handle video data, which can be useful for analyzing bird behavior or movement. Video data can be processed using 3-D CNNs or a combination of 2-D CNNs and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to capture both spatial and temporal features.

Furthermore, deep learning models can handle CSV files containing structured data. For instance, in the field of ecology, researchers may use CSV files to store bird observation data, including species, location, and time. These data can be used to train deep learning models for predictive modeling or to analyze patterns in bird populations.

In summary, deep learning models can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific problem and the type of data available. In the context of bird sound recognition, mel-scale spectrograms are commonly used as input to deep learning models.
