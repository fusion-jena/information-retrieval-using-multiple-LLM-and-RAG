Answer:
The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for the study. However, it does mention three datasets used in the study: ImageNet, Snapshot Serengeti (SS), and Lasha Mountain (LSM).

ImageNet is a benchmark dataset in the field of computer vision, which means it is a publicly available dataset. Public datasets like ImageNet are often used in deep learning as they provide a large amount of labeled data for training models.

The Snapshot Serengeti and Lasha Mountain datasets are camera trap image datasets. Camera traps are sensors that capture images or videos when triggered by motion or heat. These sensors are often used in ecological research to monitor wildlife populations. The context mentions that images within the same event (capture) are significantly similar to each other, and splitting them into training and test sets may lead to poor generalization of the DCNN model. To prevent this, they kept the integrity of events during data splitting, putting all images of an event into the same dataset.

Therefore, based on the provided context, we can infer that the methods used for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline include public datasets and camera trap sensors.
