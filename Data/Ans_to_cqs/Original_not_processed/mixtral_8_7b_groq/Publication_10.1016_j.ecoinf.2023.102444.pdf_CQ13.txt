The provided context does not give information about the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention that the number of neighbors and minimum distance were fixed at specific levels in the UMAP algorithm, which is a dimensionality reduction method used in the study.

Additionally, the study compares the performance of UMAP to Maxent, a machine learning technique commonly used in species distribution modeling. The Maxent model was run with its default parameters and 10 replications for comparative purposes.

It's important to note that different models and algorithms may have different hyperparameters that can be tuned to optimize performance. In the case of deep learning models, common hyperparameters include learning rate, batch size, number of hidden layers, and type of optimizer.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model in this study, it is important to consider tuning hyperparameters when implementing deep learning models for species distribution modeling or other applications.
