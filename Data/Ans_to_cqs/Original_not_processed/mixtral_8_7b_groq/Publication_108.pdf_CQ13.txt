Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, as described in the given context, include the number of blocks and filters, as well as the learning rate. 

The number of blocks refers to the number of encoding and decoding blocks in the U-net architecture. The specific number of blocks used in the optimal solution (scenario 5) is not explicitly stated, but it is mentioned that the architecture is shown in Figure 4, which depicts a U-net architecture with 3 encoding blocks. The number of filters refers to the number of filters in each block, and the optimal solution used the following configuration: 16 filters in the first block, 32 filters in the second block, 64 filters in the third block, and 128 filters in the fourth block.

The learning rate is another important hyperparameter that was fine-tuned during the study. The optimal solution used a learning rate of 0.001. However, the optimizer used in conjunction with the learning rate is not specified in the given context.

It is also worth noting that the evaluation metrics used in the study, such as the custom implementation of the intersection over union metric and the overall accuracy, were not subject to maximization during training. Instead, they were used as performance indicators to optimize the hyperparameters of the model.
