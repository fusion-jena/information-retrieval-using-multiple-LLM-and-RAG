Based on the provided context, the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipelines vary and can include surveys, sensors, and public datasets.

In the context of urban green view index (GVI) assessment, the paper "GreenCam: A Deep Learning Framework for Urban Green View Index Assessment" mentions the use of a dataset called UGE-D (Urban Green Extraction Dataset) for training their GVI-learning model. However, the specific method of data collection for UGE-D is not mentioned in the provided text.

In other contexts, we can find different methods of data collection. For instance, in the paper "Coco-Stuff: Thing and Stuff Classes in Context," the authors use a dataset called COCO-Stuff, which includes 164,000 well-annotated images. The images in COCO-Stuff were collected using various methods, including web search, Flickr, and Amazon Mechanical Turk.

In the paper "Assessing visual green effects of individual urban trees using airborne LiDAR data," the authors use airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data to assess the visual green effects of individual urban trees. LiDAR is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances to objects.

Furthermore, in the paper "Treepedia 2.0: applying deep learning for large-scale quantification of urban tree cover," the authors use street-level images collected from Google Street View to quantify urban tree cover. They also use a deep learning model to classify tree and non-tree pixels in the images.

Lastly, in the paper "A contribution to the assessment of scenic quality of landscapes based on preferences expressed by the public," the authors use survey data to assess the scenic quality of landscapes. They asked participants to rate the scenic quality of different landscapes based on photographs.

In summary, the methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines can include surveys, sensors, and public datasets. The specific method used depends on the research question and the availability of data.
