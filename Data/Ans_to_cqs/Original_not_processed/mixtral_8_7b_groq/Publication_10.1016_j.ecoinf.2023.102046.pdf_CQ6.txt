Answer:::

The provided context discusses specific preprocessing steps for three deep learning models (ResNet-50, Inception-V3, and ViT) used in a particular study, but it does not cover general preprocessing steps applicable to all deep learning models. However, I can provide some common preprocessing steps that are typically involved before training a deep learning model. These include:

1. **Data Loading:** The first step is to load the data into memory, which can be done using libraries like NumPy, Pandas, or data loaders provided by deep learning frameworks.

2. **Data Augmentation:** This involves applying random transformations to the input data, such as rotation, scaling, flipping, or cropping. Data augmentation helps increase the size of the training set, reduce overfitting, and improve model generalization.

3. **Normalization:** Deep learning models are sensitive to the scale of input features. Therefore, it is essential to normalize the data, usually by scaling pixel values to a range between 0 and 1 or using mean and standard deviation statistics.

4. **Resizing:** For computer vision tasks, input images are often resized to a fixed size to fit the model's input requirements. This step can also help reduce computational complexity.

5. **One-hot Encoding:** For categorical variables, one-hot encoding is used to convert categorical data into a numerical format that deep learning models can process.

6. **Missing Value Imputation:** If the dataset contains missing values, imputation techniques like mean, median, or mode can be used to fill in the missing data. Alternatively, deep learning models can be trained to handle missing values directly.

7. **Noise Removal:** In some cases, it might be necessary to remove noise from the data, such as outliers or irrelevant features, to improve model performance.

In the context provided, the following preprocessing steps were taken:

- Resizing images to specific dimensions: (299, 299) for Inception-V3, (224, 224) for ResNet-50 and ViT.
- Data augmentation was not explicitly mentioned, but it could have been applied.
- Normalization was applied using mean and standard deviation statistics for HuggingFace models (ViT and ResNet-50), while Inception-V3 used pixel scaling.
- No information about missing value imputation, noise removal, or one-hot encoding was provided.

In summary, common preprocessing steps include data loading, data augmentation, normalization, resizing, one-hot encoding, missing value imputation, and noise removal. The provided context discusses resizing and normalization specific to the study's models.
