Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the studies. The context includes descriptions of various studies that used different deep learning methods for biological data analysis, such as a Random Forest supervised learning model for genetics, a deep learning method for rice yield prediction, and a novel deep learning method called ESK for fish classification using DNA barcode sequences. However, there is no mention of a code repository link for any of these studies. Therefore, I am unable to provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
