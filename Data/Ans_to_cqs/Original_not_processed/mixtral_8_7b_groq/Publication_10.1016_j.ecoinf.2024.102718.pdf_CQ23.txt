Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, the context does mention that the model's performance was evaluated on two different datasets: PlantVillage and Dhan-Shomadhan. This suggests that the model was tested on at least two different sources of data, which can help to evaluate its performance in various conditions and improve its generalizability.

Furthermore, the authors used a modified version of the Vision Transformer (ViT) model, called BEiT, which was pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then fine-tuned on the specific leaf disease classification task. Pre-training on a diverse dataset can help improve the model's generalizability by learning features that are useful for a wide range of tasks and then adapting them to the specific problem at hand.

Additionally, the authors evaluated the model's performance under both noise-added and noise-free situations. This can help to assess the model's robustness and ability to handle variations in the input data, which can improve its generalizability in real-world scenarios where the data may not always be perfectly clean or consistent.

Overall, while the context does not provide explicit information about the use of techniques like cross-validation or stratified splitting, the authors did take steps to evaluate the model's performance on different datasets and under varying conditions, which can help to improve its generalizability.
