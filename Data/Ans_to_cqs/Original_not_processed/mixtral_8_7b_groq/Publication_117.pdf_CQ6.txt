The provided context discusses a study that uses deep learning for counting wildebeest in survey images, but it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps applied to the data before training the model. However, based on common practices in deep learning, we can infer some possible preprocessing steps.

Firstly, the images might have been resized or resampled to a standard size (e.g., 864 Ã— 864 subimages) to ensure uniform input dimensions for the model. This step helps in efficient processing and training of the deep learning model.

Secondly, normalization or scaling of pixel values could have been applied to improve model performance. Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are sensitive to the scale of input features. Thus, normalizing or scaling pixel values to a similar range, such as [0, 1] or [-1, 1], can help the model learn better.

Thirdly, data cleaning might have been necessary to remove irrelevant information or artifacts from the images. For instance, removing annotations, watermarks, or other unwanted objects from the images can help the model focus on the task of counting wildebeest.

Lastly, augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, or shifting might have been applied to increase the size of the training dataset and reduce overfitting. These techniques create variations of the original images, helping the model generalize better.

In summary, although the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps, common practices in deep learning suggest that resizing, normalization/scaling, data cleaning, and augmentation are possible steps taken before training the deep learning model.
