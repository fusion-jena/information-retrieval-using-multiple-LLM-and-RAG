Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a momentum value of μ = 0.9. However, the learning rate is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The model training was conducted on a Dell PowerEdge C4130 rack server with two Tesla K80 GPUs and 256 GB of memory, using the PyTorch 1.7.1 platform. The training process was stopped when the loss value of the model on the validation set no longer decreased. The model performance was then tested on the test set.

Regarding the source model construction, the context suggests that practitioners with abundant computational resources should build the source model with a larger number of readily available labeled samples to contribute to improved transfer learning performance. However, for those with limited computational resources, it may be necessary to compromise between sample size and computational resources based on the potential threshold effect.

The context also provides information on the experiment design, including the transfer learning strategy optimization and the source domain data splitting on the SS dataset. The dataset includes training, validation, and test sets for two different source domains (S\_2 and S\_10) with varying numbers of images and class numbers.

In summary, the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include the SGD optimizer with a momentum value of μ = 0.9. However, the learning rate is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The source model construction suggests that building the source model with a larger number of labeled samples contributes to improved transfer learning performance.
