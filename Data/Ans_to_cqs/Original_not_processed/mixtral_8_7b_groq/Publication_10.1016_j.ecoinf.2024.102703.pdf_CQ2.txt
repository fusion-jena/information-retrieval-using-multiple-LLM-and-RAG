Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the study of water quality characteristics, specifically the spectral characteristics of dissolved organic matter in Plateau Lakes located in Southwest China.

However, we can make some educated guesses about the possible data formats based on the experimental methods described. 

1. CSV or similar tabular data formats: The text mentions the analysis of various water quality parameters such as pH, water temperature, NH4-N, NO3-N, TN, TP, Chl-a, and DOC. These parameters are likely stored and manipulated as numerical data in tables, possibly in CSV format or a similar tabular data format.

2. Image or spectral data formats: The study involves the analysis of CDOM (Colored Dissolved Organic Matter) and FDOM (Fluorescent Dissolved Organic Matter) spectral data. These spectral analyses might result in data formats such as spectra files, images, or multi-dimensional arrays storing spectral information. Common image and spectral data formats include TIFF, JPEG, PNG, or specific spectral data formats like ENVI or NetCDF.

3. Time-series data formats: With four field campaigns conducted over several months, it is possible that the data is stored in a time-series format, allowing for the analysis of trends and seasonal variations in water quality parameters. Common time-series data formats include HDF5, NetCDF, or specific software-dependent formats.

In conclusion, while the context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that the study involves a combination of tabular data formats (e.g., CSV) for water quality parameters, image or spectral data formats for CDOM and FDOM analyses, and time-series data formats for tracking changes over time.
