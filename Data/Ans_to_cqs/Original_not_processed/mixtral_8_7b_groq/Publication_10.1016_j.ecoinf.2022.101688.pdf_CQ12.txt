Answer:::
Based on the provided context, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used in the pipeline for bioacoustic research. The text mentions pre-trained CNNs such as VGG16, ResNet101V2, and ResNet152V2, which are utilized for classification tasks. CNNs are a suitable choice for this task due to the fixed input size requirement of the model. The researchers determined the input size based on the duration of the vocalizations in the datasets.

Additionally, CNNs with a frozen feature extractor were found to be effective when only a small amount of data was available. This iterative process of manually annotating a few examples, using a pre-trained CNN to find new examples, and then incorporating those new examples into the training set can help speed up the rate at which calls are found. This challenges the existing knowledge that deep learning requires large training datasets.

In summary, Answer::: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used in the bioacoustic research pipeline to classify vocalizations. Pre-trained models like VGG16, ResNet101V2, and ResNet152V2 are recommended as starting points for researchers. CNNs with a frozen feature extractor can be useful when dealing with small datasets.
