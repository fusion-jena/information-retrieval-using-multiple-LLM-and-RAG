Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information given about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository link. The text discusses data management and citation practices in Earth science projects, with a focus on open-access data repositories and dynamic data citations. There are references to various projects and organizations, but none of them are related to a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
