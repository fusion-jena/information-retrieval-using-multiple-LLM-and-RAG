The provided context does not directly discuss the regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The text focuses on the use of statistical analysis, specifically the random forest classification method, for ecological applications.

However, it is important to note that the context of the provided text is related to machine learning techniques applied to ecological data, but not deep learning techniques. Regularization methods like dropout and L2 regularization are primarily used in deep learning and neural networks to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
Answer:::
I don't know. The provided context discusses statistical analysis and random forest classification, but it does not mention regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization.
