Based on the provided context, there is no information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses a study published in the journal Ecological Informatics by M.S. Freeman and colleagues, which involves the use of a deep learning pipeline for species distribution modeling. However, it does not mention where the data or code for this pipeline is stored or made available for reuse. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query. It is possible that the data repository is not specified in the given text, or it may be located elsewhere. If you are interested in accessing the data or code, I would recommend contacting the authors or checking the journal's website for more information.
