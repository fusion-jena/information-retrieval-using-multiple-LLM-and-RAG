Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of SPOT6 satellite data for the study, but it does not mention whether surveys, sensors, public datasets, or other methods were used to collect this data. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question without additional information.
