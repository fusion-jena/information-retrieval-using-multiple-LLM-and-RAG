Answer:

The context provided does not give specific information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models mentioned, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention the use of different models with varying dimensions and architectures within the EfficientDet family, which could potentially contribute to the model's generalizability.

In the context of seagrass coverage and distribution models, the papers mentioned use different methods and datasets to train and evaluate their models. Wang et al. (2020a) use an encoder-decoder-based deep learning model to estimate seagrass coverage and achieve a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 90.66%. However, the context does not provide information about the dataset's diversity or any validation techniques used.

Perez et al. (2020) map seagrass distribution using a deep capsule network (DCN) and a deep CNN, demonstrating that these models perform significantly better than linear regression and support vector machine-based models. However, the context does not specify the dataset's diversity or any validation techniques used.

Antoni Burguera (2020) maps Posidonia oceanica seagrass using two neural networks, achieving high precision, recall, and accuracy. However, the context does not provide information about the dataset's diversity or any validation techniques used.

In summary, while the context provides information about various deep learning models used for seagrass coverage and distribution, it does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of these models.
