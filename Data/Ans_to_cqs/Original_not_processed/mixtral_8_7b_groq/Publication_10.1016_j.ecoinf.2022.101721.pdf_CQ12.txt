Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline mentioned in the study by Paumen et al., 2021 is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The study developed and tested a bat calls detection and classification method based on CNN. CNNs are a type of neural network that have been designed to process data with a grid-like topology, such as an image, which makes them well-suited for analyzing spectrograms of bat calls. The authors of the study used a CNN to classify the bat calls into different species, which helped to automate the process of species identification and reduce manual labor.

It is not specified in the provided context if other types of deep learning models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or Transformers were used in other studies or pipelines related to the topic.

Additionally, it's important to note that the performance of the software incorporating an informative prior in their algorithm should not be determined through training and testing data sets alone. The performance must also be evaluated through the number of correct classifications using real-world examples.
