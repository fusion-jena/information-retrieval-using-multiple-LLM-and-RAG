Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention that BERT was used, which is a type of transformer model. Transformer models typically have several hyperparameters that can be tuned, such as learning rate, batch size, number of layers, and hidden size. The specific hyperparameters used for the BERT model in this study are not provided in the context.

Additionally, the context mentions that active learning was used to select training data, but it does not specify how the active learning algorithm was implemented or what hyperparameters were used for that.

The context also mentions that the maximum number of tokens was set to 400 for social media posts and 512 for web articles. This is not a hyperparameter of the deep learning model itself, but rather a preprocessing step to ensure that the input data fit within the maximum token limit of the BERT model.

Therefore, while the context provides some information about the preprocessing and data selection steps used in the study, it does not provide specific details about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
