Answer:::

The provided context discusses the training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for bird call recognition using active learning, but it does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps applied after the model training. However, based on common practices in machine learning, we can infer some possible postprocessing steps that might have been involved.

After training the model, one common postprocessing step is to evaluate the model's performance using various metrics. These metrics could include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). Additionally, a confusion matrix could be constructed to provide a more detailed breakdown of the model's performance across different classes.

Another possible postprocessing step is generating saliency maps. Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the input features that most influenced the model's predictions. These maps can be useful for understanding which aspects of the bird calls the model is focusing on and can help identify potential biases or weaknesses in the model.

In the context of active learning, the authors mentioned reviewing all labels by a primary annotator before the next iteration of model training. This step could be considered a part of the postprocessing as it involves examining the model's predictions and making corrections or adjustments as needed.

The authors also discussed the importance of considering biases introduced during annotation and the potential for performance improvements through the inclusion of labeled training data. These considerations suggest that the authors might have performed additional postprocessing steps focused on identifying and addressing biases or imbalances in the training data or the model's predictions.

Overall, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps taken after the model training, it is likely that the authors evaluated the model's performance using various metrics, constructed a confusion matrix, generated saliency maps, and reviewed the model's predictions with the primary annotator. Additionally, they might have performed further postprocessing steps to address biases or imbalances in the training data or the model's predictions.
