The provided context does not include information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. There is no mention of techniques such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The study primarily focuses on the analysis of mangrove forests along the southeastern coast of China and the influencing factors, without delving into the details of the deep learning model development process. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer based on the given context.
