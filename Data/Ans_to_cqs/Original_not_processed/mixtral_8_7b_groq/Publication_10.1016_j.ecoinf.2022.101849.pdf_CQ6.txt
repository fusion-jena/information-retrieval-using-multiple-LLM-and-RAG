Answer:::
In the context provided, there is no explicit mention of preprocessing steps for training a deep learning model. However, based on general practices in machine learning, several preprocessing steps are typically involved before training a deep learning model. These steps include:

1. Data cleaning: This involves removing or correcting erroneous data points. In the context provided, this would correspond to correcting the errors (red shading) in the training data.

2. Normalization or Scaling: This is the process of rescaling numeric data to a common range, often between 0 and 1. This is important for many machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models, as they can be sensitive to the scale of the input features.

3. Feature engineering: This involves creating new features from the existing data that might help improve the model's performance. This could involve creating polynomial or interaction features, or using domain knowledge to create more relevant features.

4. Encoding categorical variables: Deep learning models typically work with numerical data, so categorical variables need to be converted into a numerical format. This could be done through one-hot encoding, label encoding, or other methods.

5. Splitting the data: The data is typically split into training, validation, and test sets. The model is trained on the training set, tuned on the validation set, and evaluated on the test set.

6. Data augmentation: This is a technique used to increase the amount of training data, especially in the case of image data. It involves creating new data by applying transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, scaling, or flipping.

In the context of predictive modeling of global vegetation cover, these steps would be applied to the dataset used for training the deep learning model. However, the specific steps and methods used would depend on the nature of the data and the requirements of the model.
