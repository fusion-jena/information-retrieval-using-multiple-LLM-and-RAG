Answer:

In the given context, the training of the Mask R-CNN model appears to be determined by the number of epochs, which is set to 20, rather than by a condition related to validation loss plateau or any other criteria.

However, it is worth noting that in typical deep learning training, early stopping is a common technique used to prevent overfitting and determine when training is complete. Early stopping involves specifying a metric, usually validation loss, and stopping the training if the metric does not improve after a certain number of epochs. This technique is not mentioned in the provided context.

In the case of the provided context, the training appears to be stopped after 20 epochs, regardless of the validation loss or any other criteria. The loss values for training and validation are recorded and include rpn\_class\_loss, rpn\_bbox\_loss, mrcnn\_class\_loss, mrcnn\_bbox\_loss, and mrcnn\_mask\_loss for training, and val\_rpn\_bbox\_loss, val\_rpn\_class\_loss, val\_mrcnn\_bbox\_loss, and val\_mrcnn\_mask\_loss for validation. The total loss for training is the sum of these individual losses.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention any criteria used to determine when training is complete, it can be inferred that the training is determined by the number of epochs, and early stopping or other criteria are not used in this case.
