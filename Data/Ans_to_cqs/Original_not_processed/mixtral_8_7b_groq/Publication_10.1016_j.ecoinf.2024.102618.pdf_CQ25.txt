Answer: The deep learning models used in the study are for the purpose of plant disease classification. Specifically, five different deep-learning models are proposed to classify plant diseases: DenseNet201, efficientNetB0, efficientNetB3, Inceptionresnetv2, and ResNet50v2. Additionally, various ensembles of these models are also used to increase classification accuracy.

DenseNet201 is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that has 201 deep layers, and each layer is connected to subsequent layers. The other models, efficientNetB0, efficientNetB3, Inceptionresnetv2, and ResNet50v2, are also CNNs with different architectures and number of layers.

The deep learning models are used to classify plant leaf diseases based on images. The models take an image of a plant leaf as input and output the predicted disease. The models are trained on a large dataset of plant leaf images, each labeled with the correct disease.

To evaluate the performance of the deep learning models, several metrics are used, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Accuracy measures the overall percentage of correct predictions, while precision measures the number of positive predictions that are actually correct. Recall measures how many positive predictions were correctly spotted by the model, and F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

The study reports the F1-score for each individual model and each ensemble of models. The F1-score ranges from 0 to 1, with a higher score indicating better performance. The results show that the ensembles of models generally perform better than the individual models, with some ensembles achieving F1-scores above 0.99.

In summary, the purpose of the deep learning models in this study is to classify plant diseases based on images of plant leaves. The models are evaluated using several performance metrics, and the results show that ensembles of models generally perform better than individual models.
