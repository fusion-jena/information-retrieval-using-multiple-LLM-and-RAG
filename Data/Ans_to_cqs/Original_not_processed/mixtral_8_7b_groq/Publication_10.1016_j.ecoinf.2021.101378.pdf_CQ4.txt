Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for insect forest risk assessment. However, I can provide some general information about data augmentation techniques that are commonly used in deep learning.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by applying various transformations to the existing data. This helps to improve the model's performance by providing more diverse data for training. Some common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning are:

1. Flipping: This involves flipping the image horizontally or vertically to create a new image. This helps the model to learn features that are invariant to the direction of the image.
2. Rotation: This involves rotating the image by a certain angle to create a new image. This helps the model to learn features that are invariant to the orientation of the image.
3. Scaling: This involves scaling the image up or down to create a new image. This helps the model to learn features that are invariant to the size of the image.
4. Translation: This involves shifting the image horizontally or vertically to create a new image. This helps the model to learn features that are invariant to the position of the image.
5. Cropping: This involves randomly cropping a portion of the image to create a new image. This helps the model to learn features that are important regardless of the context of the image.
6. Color jittering: This involves randomly changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue of the image to create a new image. This helps the model to learn features that are invariant to the color of the image.

These data augmentation techniques can be applied to the images used for insect forest risk assessment to improve the model's performance. However, the specific data augmentation techniques used in the study described in the context are not mentioned.
