The provided context discusses the use of data augmentation techniques during the training of deep learning models, but it does not explicitly mention any methods specifically aimed at addressing data bias during preprocessing. However, data augmentation can indirectly help reduce bias by increasing the variability of the training data, which can help the model generalize better and reduce overfitting to specific patterns in the original dataset.

That being said, some common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing include:

1. Stratified sampling: This method involves dividing the dataset into strata based on the variable of interest and then ensuring that each stratum is proportionally represented in both the training and testing sets. This can help ensure that the model is exposed to a diverse range of examples and reduces the risk of bias due to underrepresentation of certain groups.

2. Oversampling: When a particular class or group is underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from that class or group. This can help the model learn more about the characteristics of that group and reduce bias due to underrepresentation.

3. Undersampling: Conversely, when a particular class or group is overrepresented in the dataset, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of instances from that class or group. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards that group and improve its ability to generalize to other groups.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from a wide range of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population of interest can help reduce bias due to underrepresentation or overrepresentation of certain groups.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, data augmentation can indirectly help reduce bias by increasing the variability of the training data. Other common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
