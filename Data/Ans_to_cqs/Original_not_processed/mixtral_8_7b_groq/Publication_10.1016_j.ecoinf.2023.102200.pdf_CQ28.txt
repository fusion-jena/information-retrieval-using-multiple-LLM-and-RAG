Based on the information provided, there is no mention of any specific platform that was used to deploy the deep learning model. The context focuses mainly on the methodology and data processing techniques used for wetlands classification and tree canopies segmentation in urban areas.

The first source, Liu and Abd-Elrahman (2018), discusses a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for wetlands classification using unmanned aerial systems (UAS) imagery and LiDAR data. However, it does not mention any details about the platform used for deploying the deep learning model.

The second source, Marasigan et al. (2019), focuses on mangrove crown diameter measurement from airborne LiDAR data using a marker-controlled watershed algorithm. There is no discussion of deep learning models or deployment platforms in this source.

The third source, Martins et al. (2021), presents a machine learning approach for tree canopies segmentation in urban areas using SLIC and LiDAR data. Again, there is no mention of any platform used for deploying the deep learning model.

The context also provides some details about the LiDAR sensor and UAV used for data collection. However, there is no information about the platform used for deep learning model deployment.

In conclusion, based on the provided pieces of context, there is no clear answer to the query regarding the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
