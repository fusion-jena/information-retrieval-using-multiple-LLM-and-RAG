Answer:::

The provided context does not contain specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the study of animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring. However, it is mentioned that deep learning is used in the study of modeling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring (Chalmers, C., Fergus, P., Wich, S., Longmore, S.N., 2021).

In general, optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for training neural networks. These optimization algorithms are used to minimize the loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted and actual values.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters by taking a step in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. It is a stochastic version of the batch gradient descent algorithm, which uses the entire training dataset to compute the gradient at each iteration. SGD, on the other hand, uses a single random sample from the training dataset to compute the gradient, making it more computationally efficient.

Adam is an optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of SGD and other optimization algorithms. It uses the moving averages of the gradient and the squared gradient to adapt the learning rate for each parameter. This adaptive learning rate allows Adam to converge faster and more efficiently than SGD in many cases.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the study of animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring, optimization algorithms such as SGD and Adam are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for training neural networks.
