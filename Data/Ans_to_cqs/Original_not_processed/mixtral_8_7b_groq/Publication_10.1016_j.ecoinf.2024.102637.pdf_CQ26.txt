The provided context does not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some methods related to data preprocessing and model optimization in deep learning.

In the context, the authors propose a lightweight SIAlex model that utilizes AlexNet as the backbone, aiming to balance speed and accuracy. They also introduce a method of cascading multiple activation functions to improve the model's efficiency and performance. These techniques, however, are not specifically designed to address data bias during preprocessing.

In the literature, some common techniques used to address data bias include:

1. Stratified splitting: This method involves dividing the data into subgroups based on specific features, then randomly splitting these subgroups to ensure a balanced representation in the training and testing sets.

2. Oversampling: In cases where certain classes are underrepresented, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from these classes, either by replicating existing instances or generating synthetic data.

3. Undersampling: Conversely, if some classes have too many instances, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of instances from these classes, either randomly or using more sophisticated techniques.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources and ensuring a diverse representation of the target population can help reduce data bias.

While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, they are essential for addressing data bias during preprocessing in deep learning pipelines. Researchers and practitioners should consider these methods when working with imbalanced or biased datasets.
