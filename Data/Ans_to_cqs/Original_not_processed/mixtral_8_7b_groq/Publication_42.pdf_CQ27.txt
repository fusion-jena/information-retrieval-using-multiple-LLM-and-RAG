Answer:::
The text provided does not give a detailed description of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that a customized CNN architecture was chosen because it achieved a high F1-score, indicating that it was accurate in its predictions. The architecture had an average precision, recall, and F1-score of 93%. The model was trained using the Adam optimizer, and the number of learnable parameters was 3, 3, 32, 128, 512 for the first layer and 5, 3, 32, 128, 512 for the last layer.

Additionally, the customized CNN architectures were compared with selected state-of-the-art CNN optimized architectures, such as EfficientNetB0 and DenseNet121. The EfficientNetB0 achieved a F1-score of 88.62%, which is lower than the top five best architectures. DenseNet121 was also used, but the specific results were not provided.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the trained deep learning model was likely serialized, and then compared with other state-of-the-art models. The platform for deployment is not specified in the text.
