Answer:::

In the context provided, there is no direct mention of strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, there are some related discussions on the use of specific deep learning libraries and machine learning methods that can provide insights into handling randomness.

PyTorch is a popular open-source machine learning library for deep learning (Paszke et al., 2019). While the text does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value in PyTorch, the library does provide a function to set the random seed for reproducibility purposes. By setting a specific seed value, users can ensure consistent and reproducible results across different runs of their deep learning models.

In the context of machine learning methods, Breiner et al. (2015) discuss the use of ensembles of small models to overcome limitations in modeling rare species. While not directly related to handling randomness, ensemble methods like random forests or gradient boosting machines can help reduce the impact of randomness by aggregating the predictions of multiple models. This can lead to more stable and reliable predictions, even when some models in the ensemble are affected by randomness.

Furthermore, in the context of data sampling for model validation and testing, the text suggests sampling 10% and 30% of the remaining dataset for these purposes (no specific mention of random sampling). However, in the context of machine learning and deep learning, it is common practice to use random sampling when creating validation and test sets. This helps ensure that the samples used for validation and testing are representative of the overall dataset and reduces the impact of any potential biases or idiosyncrasies in the data.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does touch upon related topics such as the use of deep learning libraries with seed value settings, ensemble methods to reduce the impact of randomness, and the common practice of using random sampling for validation and testing in machine learning and deep learning.
