Answer:::

The text provided does not give a detailed explanation of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that training and test data were used, and that the test data was embedded into the UMAP model for projection in the latent space. Additionally, nearest neighbor Euclidean distances between species-species (Dss) and background-species (Dsb) were computed, and the cumulative empirical distribution function of the intra-species distance Dss, Pss, was calculated. This was followed by calculating S for the distances between the background and species. These steps suggest that some form of cross-validation or testing was performed to evaluate the performance of the model. However, it is not explicitly stated whether a diverse dataset or stratified splitting was used. Therefore, while some measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model, the specific methods used are not fully detailed in the text provided.
