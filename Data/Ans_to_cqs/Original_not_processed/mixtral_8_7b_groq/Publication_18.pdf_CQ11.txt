Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context includes several research papers that use deep learning techniques for various applications such as skin cancer classification, Go game, human-level control, image quality assessment, image super-resolution, and scattered shrub detection. However, none of these papers mention a data repository link for their deep learning pipeline.

Moreover, the context also includes some general information about data preparation for deep learning, such as the importance of a large number of annotated images, data augmentation, and transfer learning. But again, there is no mention of a specific data repository link.

Therefore, I am sorry but I don't know the answer to this query.
