The provided context does not give specific information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of random seed values. However, it does discuss the EMViT-Net model's performance in comparison to other deep learning models in terms of classification accuracy and training time.

Deep learning models often involve randomness during various stages of the pipeline, such as weight initialization, data shuffling, and dropout regularization. Using a fixed random seed value ensures that the same randomness is introduced during each run of the model, making the results reproducible.

While the context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, it does discuss the experimental setup and training configuration of the EMViT-Net model. It is possible that a fixed random seed value was used to ensure reproducibility, but the information is not provided in the context.

In summary, the provided context does not contain specific information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is common practice to use a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility in deep learning models.
