Answer:::
The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions various techniques and parameters used in the model's architecture, such as the MLP architecture with four layers, each containing 512 neurons, residual connections, batch normalization, Rectified Linear Unit activation function, and a sigmoid function in the final layer. The training parameters like batch size, number of epochs, AdamW optimizer, weight decay, learning rate, learning rate scheduler with exponential decay, and dropout are also mentioned. However, it does not specify the hardware resources used for training the model, such as GPUs, TPUs, or any other specific hardware. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query based on the given context.
