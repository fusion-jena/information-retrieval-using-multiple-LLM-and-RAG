Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline mentioned does not seem to involve any of the commonly used datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the study appears to focus on estimating Above Ground Biomass (AGB) using remote sensing data.

The remote sensing data used in the study include optical imaging, LiDAR, and RADAR. Specifically, the study utilized optical remote sensing data from platforms such as Landsat, MODIS, SPOT, IKONOS, QuickBird, Sentinel-1 & 2, and Worldview. These data are available at different spatial and spectral resolutions.

Moreover, the study used Landsat data extensively for AGB estimation, particularly over the last two decades. Optical data predominantly capture the top vegetation layer and are sensitive to phenology, climate, and moisture content, which affects its accuracy, especially in densely vegetated areas.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in this study involves using remote sensing data, specifically optical imaging data from various platforms, to estimate AGB.
