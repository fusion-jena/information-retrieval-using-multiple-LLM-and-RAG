Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. Hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in machine learning model development, and there are various methods to perform this task, such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, etc.

However, there are some related details in the context that can give us a general idea about the model development process. For instance, the authors mentioned using deep object detectors and open-source deep learning approaches for bacterial image analysis. These statements suggest that the model might be based on deep learning techniques, which often require careful hyperparameter tuning.

Furthermore, the context mentions a paper titled "Stage-wise hyperparameter optimization for deep convolutional neural networks" by Fu et al., 2018. Although this paper is not directly related to the current model, it indicates that the researchers are aware of the importance of hyperparameter optimization in deep learning models.

In summary, the provided context does not offer explicit information about the hyperparameter optimization method for the model. However, the mention of deep learning techniques and a related paper on hyperparameter optimization suggests that the researchers might have used a systematic approach to optimize the model's hyperparameters.
