Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that fine-tuning of the model was performed for 100 epochs. In machine learning, an epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset. This means that the model was trained for a fixed number of epochs, regardless of whether validation loss was plateauing or not.

In addition, the context mentions that two episodic tasks were constructed from the training set for testing. These tasks could potentially have been used to evaluate the performance of the model during training and determine when training should be stopped. However, the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.

It is worth noting that early stopping is a common technique used to prevent overfitting and determine when training should be stopped. Early stopping involves monitoring the performance of the model on a validation set during training, and stopping training when the performance on the validation set stops improving or starts getting worse. However, the context provided does not mention whether early stopping was used in this case.

In summary, while the context provides some information about the training process, it does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It is possible that a fixed number of epochs was used, or that early stopping was employed based on the performance of the model on a validation set. However, this is speculation, as the context does not provide enough information to make a definitive answer.
