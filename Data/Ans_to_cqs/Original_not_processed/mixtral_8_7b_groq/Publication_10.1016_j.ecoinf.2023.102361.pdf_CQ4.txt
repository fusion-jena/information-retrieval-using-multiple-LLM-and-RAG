Based on the provided context, the text does not explicitly mention the specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, it is stated that many studies use data augmentation techniques to increase the number of training data, which generally improves the classification accuracy. Therefore, it can be inferred that the researchers possibly used common data augmentation techniques including flipping, rotating, and scaling, as they are widely used in the field of deep learning to increase the amount and diversity of training data.

Data augmentation techniques like flipping (horizontal or vertical), rotating (within a certain degree), and scaling (changing the size while keeping the aspect ratio) are popular methods to artificially expand the dataset and prevent overfitting. These techniques can generate new images by applying transformations to the existing images, thus enabling the model to learn more robust features.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly list the data augmentation techniques used, it is highly likely that the researchers employed common techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling, given the emphasis on data augmentation as a means to improve classification accuracy and the widespread use of these methods in deep learning research.
