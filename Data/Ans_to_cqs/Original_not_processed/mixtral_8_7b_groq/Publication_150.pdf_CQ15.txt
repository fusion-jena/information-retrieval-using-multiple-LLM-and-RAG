Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in the given context uses the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer, specifically for training deep learning models. The SGD optimizer is used with an initial learning rate of 0.01 for all models except MansNet, which has an initial learning rate of 0.1. The learning rate is reduced by a factor of 10 after every 30 epochs.

Answer:::

Moreover, the deep learning pipeline employs Batch Normalization, a technique that normalizes the input layer by re-centering and re-scaling activations of the previous layer in each mini-batch. Batch Normalization helps in improving the generalization and stability of the neural network during training.

Answer:::

Furthermore, the models are trained for 150 epochs using Nvidia Tesla K80 or P100 GPUs. Training for a larger number of epochs allows the model to learn and optimize the weights and biases more effectively. The use of GPUs accelerates the training process, making it faster and more efficient.

Answer:::

It is worth noting that the context does not mention any other optimization techniques such as Adam, RMSprop, or Adagrad. However, the use of the SGD optimizer with a dynamic learning rate and batch normalization provides a solid optimization strategy for the deep learning pipeline.

Answer:::

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in the given context uses the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with a dynamic learning rate, Batch Normalization, and trains the models for 150 epochs using Nvidia Tesla K80 or P100 GPUs.
