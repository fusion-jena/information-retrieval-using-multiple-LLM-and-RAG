Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model for bird species identification using unmanned aircraft systems. However, the context does provide information about the use of unmanned aircraft systems, sound recorders, and deep learning models for bird species identification.

The article "Drones and sound recorders increase the number of bird species identified: A combined surveys approach" by Fischer et al. (2023) discusses the use of unmanned aircraft systems (drones) and sound recorders for bird surveys. The study found that using a combined approach of drones and sound recorders increased the number of bird species identified compared to traditional survey methods. The study also used bird song identification software such as Bird Song Id Australia and Raven Lite for species identification. However, the context does not provide information on the specific deep learning model used or the process followed to deploy it.

The article "Modelling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring and deep learning" by Chalmers et al. (2021) discusses the use of deep learning models for species identification using acoustic monitoring. The study used a deep learning model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify bird species based on their vocalizations. The model was trained using a dataset of bird vocalizations and achieved high accuracy in species identification. However, the context does not provide information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.

The article "Unmanned aircraft systems in wildlife research: current and future applications of a transformative technology" by Christie et al. (2016) discusses the use of unmanned aircraft systems in wildlife research, including bird surveys. The study mentions the potential of using deep learning models for species identification but does not provide specific information on the process followed to deploy such models.

Therefore, while the context provides information on the use of unmanned aircraft systems, sound recorders, and deep learning models for bird species identification, it does not provide specific information on the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. The process of deploying a deep learning model typically involves steps such as model serialization, platform selection, and integration with existing systems, but the context does not provide information on these steps.

Answer:::
There is no specific information provided in the context on the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model for bird species identification using unmanned aircraft systems. The context discusses the use of unmanned aircraft systems, sound recorders, and deep learning models for bird species identification but does not provide information on the process of deploying a trained deep learning model.
