Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model for detecting Northern Bobwhite covey calls involved model serialization and platform selection.

Firstly, the researchers developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for the automatic detection of Northern Bobwhite covey calls (Nolan et al., 2022). After training the model on covey call spectrogram data collected from Di-Lane and other sites around Georgia and Alabama, USA, they serialized the model. Model serialization is the process of saving the model architecture and weights to a file, which can be later loaded and used for making predictions. Serialization allows researchers to share their models with others, making it easier for them to reproduce and build upon the work.

Next, the researchers used the serialized model to analyze recordings of avian vocalizations. They used a previously developed CNN model trained on covey call data and deployed it on automated recording units (ARUs) to detect and localize all covey calls per ARU during the recording period. The model notes the associated time and peak power (dB) of each detected covey call.

The platform selection for deploying the model involved using ARUs to record avian vocalizations. ARUs are autonomous recording devices that can be deployed in the field to record audio for extended periods. The use of ARUs allows researchers to collect large amounts of data over long periods, enabling them to monitor bird populations and their habitats better.

To evaluate the model's accuracy, the researchers manually reviewed all CNN detections at a 0.95 score threshold from a random sample of five one-hour files from each year. They calculated the false positive rate, i.e., how many calls were incorrectly labeled as bobwhite.

In summary, the researchers followed the process of model serialization and platform selection to deploy the trained deep learning model for detecting Northern Bobwhite covey calls. They serialized the model after training it on covey call spectrogram data and deployed it on ARUs for analyzing recordings of avian vocalizations. The use of ARUs allowed them to collect large amounts of data, enabling them to monitor bird populations and their habitats better. Manual review of the model's detections helped evaluate the model's accuracy and calculate the false positive rate.
