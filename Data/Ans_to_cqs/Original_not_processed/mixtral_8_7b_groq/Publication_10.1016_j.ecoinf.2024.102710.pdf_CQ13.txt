Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate or optimizer used in the deep learning models. The models mentioned include BirdNet, VGGish, YAMNet, VGG16, and ResNet152V2, but the hyperparameters used in training are not specified. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query. However, it is important to note that the choice of learning rate and optimizer can significantly impact the performance of a deep learning model, and these hyperparameters are often carefully tuned during the training process.
