Answer:::
The deep learning model in this system is built using TensorFlow and Keras frameworks. Specifically, it is most compatible with TensorFlow version 1.14.0 and Keras version 2.2.4. These versions were used in conjunction with Python 3.6 to implement the model on a machine with one GPU. The batch size for Mask R-CNN training is taken as the product of the number of GPUs and images per GPU. The backbone structures used are Resnet 50 and Resnet 101, and anchor boxes of ratios 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512 are employed. The width and height of images in this research are fixed, resulting in an image shape of [a,640,640,3] and a mask shape of [a,640,640,1], where 'a' represents the number of training images and true masked images.

Mask R-CNN is a combination of Faster R-CNN and FCN models, with some advancements. A parallel layer of FCN is added for the mask implementation in the Faster R-CNN head, along with some extra convolutional layers on each Region of Interest (RoI). This model is used to separately perform object detection and semantic segmentation, providing instance segmentation as output.

Another important aspect of this system is the data collection and annotation process. The data is collected using a KaKaXi fixed camera, which takes images every hour within a fixed period of time each day. These images are then saved in a database for further processing. The dataset is created from scratch and annotated for custom training.

In summary, the deep learning model in this system is built using TensorFlow and Keras frameworks, specifically TensorFlow version 1.14.0 and Keras version 2.2.4. The model utilizes Resnet 50 and Resnet 101 as backbone structures and employs anchor boxes of ratios 32, 64, 128, 256, and 512. The model is trained using a batch size taken as the product of the number of GPUs and images per GPU. Data collection is performed using a KaKaXi fixed camera, and the dataset is created from scratch and annotated for custom training.
