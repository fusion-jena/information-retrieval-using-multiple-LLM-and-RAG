The provided context does not give specific information about the deep learning pipeline used in the study. However, it does mention that gaping data, temperature data, and chlorophyll data were used in the analysis. The gaping data is expressed as a proportion of aperture and recorded at 1 Hz, then averaged over 5 minutes in the Venice Lagoon and over 1 minute in the Wadden Sea. This results in daily curves of gaping for each sensor, which are used as input in the analysis. The temperature and chlorophyll data are likely in a format that can be combined with the gaping data for analysis, but the specific format is not mentioned. Therefore, the answer to the query is:

Answer:::
The specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned in the provided context. The data used in the analysis includes gaping data, temperature data, and chlorophyll data, but the format of these data is not specified.
