Based on the provided context, there is no information about the preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model. The context discusses the use of an ensemble modeling approach in the BIOMOD2 package in R for predicting the distribution of a study species, but it does not mention any preprocessing steps specific to deep learning models.

However, in general, preprocessing steps for deep learning models can include:

1. Data cleaning: This involves removing or correcting erroneous data points, such as missing or outlier values.
2. Data normalization/scaling: This involves scaling the data to a similar range to prevent any features from having a disproportionate influence on the model. Common methods include min-max scaling and z-score normalization.
3. Data splitting: This involves dividing the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
4. Feature engineering: This involves creating new features from the existing data, such as polynomial features or interaction terms, to improve the model's performance.

Therefore, while the provided context does not mention any specific preprocessing steps for deep learning models, these are some general steps that are often taken before training such models.
