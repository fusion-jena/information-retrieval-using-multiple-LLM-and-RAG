The text provided does not give specific details about the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model is retrained based on RGB hand-annotations, which implies that the model has gone through a training phase and is ready to be deployed.

The process of deploying a deep learning model typically involves a few steps, such as model serialization and platform selection. Model serialization is the process of saving the model architecture and weights to a file, so that it can be loaded and used for making predictions on new data. This can be done using various libraries and frameworks, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn.

Once the model is serialized, it can be deployed on a platform that is suitable for the task at hand. This could be a local machine, a cluster of machines, or a cloud-based platform. The choice of platform will depend on factors such as the size and complexity of the model, the volume of data that needs to be processed, and the required latency and throughput.

In the context of the text provided, it is not clear whether the model has been serialized and deployed on a specific platform. However, it is mentioned that the model is retrained based on hand-annotated data, which suggests that the model is ready to be deployed for making predictions on new data.

In summary, while the text provided does not give specific details about the process of deploying the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the model has gone through a training phase and is ready to be deployed. The process of deploying a deep learning model typically involves model serialization and platform selection, but the specifics of this process are not provided in the text.
