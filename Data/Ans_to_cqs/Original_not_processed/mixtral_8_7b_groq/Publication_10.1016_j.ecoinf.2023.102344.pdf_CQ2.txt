Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipelines utilized in the study primarily used image data formats as inputs to the pre-trained networks. Specifically, the researchers employed four pre-trained networks, namely EfficientNet-B0, ResNet101, MobilNetV2, and InceptionV3, using raw bivalve images.

In the first approach, the researchers integrated PCA-NCA for feature extraction, while in the second approach, they relied on the built-in architecture of the pre-trained networks to extract features from the raw images. These features were not visible to human eyes for visual discrimination.

The context does not explicitly mention other data formats, such as audio, video, or CSV, being used in the deep learning pipelines. However, it is important to note that the methods and networks used in this study can be adapted for other data formats. For instance, pre-trained networks for audio or video analysis can be utilized for those respective data formats.

In summary, the provided context primarily discusses the use of image data formats in deep learning pipelines. However, the methods and networks used can be extended to other data formats, such as audio, video, or CSV, depending on the specific application and problem at hand.
