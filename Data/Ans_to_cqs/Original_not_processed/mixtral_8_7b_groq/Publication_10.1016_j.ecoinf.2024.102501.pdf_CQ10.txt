Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in predicting dissolved oxygen concentration in water. The papers mentioned in the context use various deep learning methods such as LSTM, gamma test variable selection, and hybrid machine learning, but they do not provide a link to the code repository.

However, some of the papers do provide insights into the methodology and techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. For instance, Heddam et al. (2022b) used the long-short term memory (LSTM) deep learning model to predict dissolved oxygen concentration in river water. Similarly, Moghadam et al. (2021) used a deep recurrent neural network model to predict river dissolved oxygen concentration.

Moreover, Chen et al. (2020) considered temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure in the air as input variables for the model, which could be useful in developing a deep learning pipeline. Additionally, O'Donncha et al. (2022) developed a spatio-temporal LSTM model to forecast across multiple temporal and spatial scales, which could be applied to predict dissolved oxygen concentration.

Therefore, while there is no direct link to the code repository, researchers and developers can refer to the methodology and techniques used in the aforementioned papers to develop a deep learning pipeline for predicting dissolved oxygen concentration in water.
