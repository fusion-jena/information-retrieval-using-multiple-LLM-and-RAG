Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Deep Neural Network (DNN). This information can be inferred from the context provided, where it's mentioned that "Deep Neural Network models" were used to detect and map burned areas within the Cerrado biome. The DNN model is a learning algorithm based on an artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers, which uses hierarchical data processing. The input data in each module (hidden layer) results in an output that is an input for the next module, connected through weights and biases whose values are learned during the training of the network.
