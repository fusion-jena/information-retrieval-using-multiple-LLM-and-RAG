Answer:::
The generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured by dividing the data into a training set and a test set, which is a common technique used in machine learning. Specifically, 80% of the data was used for training the model, while the remaining 20% was used for testing. This approach, known as splitting, allows the model to be trained on one portion of the data and tested on a separate, previously unseen portion. As a result, it is possible to assess the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data accurately.

Additionally, the study used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to understand which features are most important in predicting the start and (height of the) peak of the greening season. SHAP is a model-agnostic interpretation method that allows human users to understand the predictions made by a machine learning model. It is gaining in popularity and is now often used in ecology.

It is worth noting that the study used the model-agnostic Kernel SHAP method, which is particularly useful when dealing with black-box models, such as MLPs (Multi-Layer Perceptrons). Black-box models, while powerful, can make it difficult to determine the structure of the approximated function. This led to the development of the field of explainable artificial intelligence (xAI), which aims to create methods that allow human users to understand the predictions made by an ML model.

In summary, the generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured by dividing the data into a training set and a test set, and by using SHAP values to understand the model's predictions. The use of a model-agnostic interpretation method, such as SHAP, is particularly important when dealing with black-box models, as it allows human users to understand the model's predictions.
