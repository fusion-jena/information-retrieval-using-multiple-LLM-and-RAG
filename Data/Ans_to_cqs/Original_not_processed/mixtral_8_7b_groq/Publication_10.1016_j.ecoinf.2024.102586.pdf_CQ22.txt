The provided context does not include information about the specific deep learning model or the metrics used to evaluate its performance. However, it does mention that a Random Forest (RF) model was used to analyze the relationship between invasive alien species and environmental and anthropogenic factors. The RF model's performance was evaluated using predicted accuracy.

In general, for deep learning models, various metrics can be used to evaluate performance, depending on the specific task and the nature of the data. Some common metrics for classification tasks include:

1. Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions.
2. Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions (correctly labeled positive instances) out of all positive predictions.
3. Recall (Sensitivity): The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.
4. F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
5. Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC): A metric that measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes by plotting the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various threshold settings.

These metrics can be useful for assessing the performance of deep learning models in different scenarios. However, the provided context does not contain enough information to determine which metrics were used for the deep learning model in question.
