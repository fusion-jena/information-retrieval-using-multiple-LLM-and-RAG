Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The sources mention various aspects of model development, such as the use of the Gumbel-Softmax function, the definition of the update criterion, and the application of the model to different fields like epidemiology and forest fire detection. However, they do not specify the optimization techniques used for hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query without additional information.
