Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training typically involve creating training, test, and validation datasets. The training data is used for training the model, while the validation data is used for selecting the best model after verification using the test data.

In the context provided, it is mentioned that the data splitting process is initiated by randomizing the dataset before splitting when there is a class imbalance. However, since the problem is a time-series problem, it implies that the data splitting should be done carefully to preserve the temporal order of the data.

In time-series problems, it is common to use techniques such as time-series cross-validation or rolling window approaches for splitting the data. Time-series cross-validation involves creating multiple training and validation sets by sliding a fixed-size window across the entire dataset. In contrast, the rolling window approach involves fixing a window size for training and a smaller window size for validation, sliding the training window across the dataset, and using the validation window to evaluate the model's performance.

Moreover, the proposed deep learning framework for highway air quality monitoring and prediction uses the Fastai library for data pre-processing and model training. Fastai is built on the PyTorch framework and allows quick analysis using its readily encoded best practices. However, the specific criteria used for splitting the data in this framework are not provided in the context.

Therefore, while the general criteria for splitting the data for deep learning model training involve creating training, test, and validation datasets, the specific criteria used for time-series problems such as highway air quality monitoring and prediction may involve techniques such as time-series cross-validation or rolling window approaches.
