Answer:
The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models, specifically referred to as CNN-BiGRU. This hybrid model is part of a larger multi-temporal forecasting model of daily streamflow (Qflow), which also includes comparative machine learning methods such as KELM, RVFL, and CNN-BiRNN. These models are used to create four complementary models: MVMD-CNN-BiGRU, MVMD-RVFL, MVMD-KELM, and MVMD-CNN-BiRNN. The CNN component is used for feature extraction, while the GRU component is used for sequence prediction. The combination of these two types of models allows for the capture of spatial and temporal dependencies in the data.
