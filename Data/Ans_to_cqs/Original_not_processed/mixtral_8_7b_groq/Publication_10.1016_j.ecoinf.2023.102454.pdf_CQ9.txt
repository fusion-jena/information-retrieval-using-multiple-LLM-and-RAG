Based on the information provided, there is no mention of a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is available, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. However, the context does provide details about the data sources used in the study, which might help locate the data.

The nighttime lighting data for 2000-2021 is an extended NPP-VIIRS-like NTL Data, available for free download at the National Earth System Science Data Centre (http://www.geodata.cn). The provincial statistical energy data and carbon emission factors for various energy sources are obtained from the China Statistical Yearbook, the Xi'an Statistical Yearbook, and the "2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventory." Lastly, the administrative boundary data for Xi'an were provided by the National Basic Geographic Information System (http://www.ngcc.cn).

To find the deep learning pipeline's data, you may want to look at the studies or repositories associated with the sources mentioned above. You can start by checking the official websites of these data sources and looking for information about data repositories or datasets used in related research. If the data is not directly available, you can try contacting the data providers or the authors of the study for more information.
