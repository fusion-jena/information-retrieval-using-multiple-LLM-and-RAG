Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps for remote sensing image data before analyzing the decomposition of organic matter by a microbial community include geometric, radiometric, and image mosaicking, and cropping. These steps are performed using remote sensing image data from Landsat 8 OLI and TIRS bands and Google Earth Engine (GEE).

Firstly, geometric correction is applied to the images to ensure that the shape, size, and location of the features in the image are accurate. Radiometric correction is then performed to adjust the brightness and contrast of the image, which helps to improve the accuracy of the analysis. Image mosaicking involves combining multiple images to create a larger, more cohesive image, while cropping is used to remove unwanted areas from the image.

After these initial preprocessing steps, topographic variables such as slope, aspect, drainage, and parent material are calculated from a digital elevation model (DEM) using the System for Automated Geoscientific Analysis (SAGA) GIS. These topographic variables are important for understanding the spatial distribution of the microbial community and the decomposition of organic matter.

Once the topographic variables have been calculated, the original image's Digital Number (DN) is used to provide the measured Surface Reflectance (SR). The SR image sets from GEE are then used to speed up data processing.

While the context does not explicitly mention data normalization, scaling, or cleaning, these steps are commonly performed in deep learning model training. Data normalization involves scaling the data to a common range, such as 0 to 1, which helps to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the model. Data scaling is similar to normalization but involves adjusting the data to a specific range or standard deviation. Data cleaning involves removing outliers or errors from the data, which helps to improve the quality of the model.

Therefore, based on the provided context and general practices in deep learning model training, the preprocessing steps for remote sensing image data before training a deep learning model would include geometric, radiometric, and image mosaicking, and cropping, calculation of topographic variables, and data normalization, scaling, and cleaning.
