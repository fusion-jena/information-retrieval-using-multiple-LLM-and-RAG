Answer:::

The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context are ImageNet, Darksound, and bird sound datasets. The ImageNet database is a large and general dataset used for training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) backbones, including ResNet18, VGG16, DenseNet121, and AlexNet. These pre-trained models are then fine-tuned on the Darksound dataset, which is an ecoacoustic dataset used for determining the optimal CNN backbone for the meta-learning algorithms of the MEC method.

In addition, the context mentions that using features extracted from models trained on smaller but more specific datasets, such as bird sound datasets, leads to higher quality classification. Specifically, the BirdNET algorithm, which is trained on spectrograms of bird sounds, could improve the parameter initialization of the UML algorithms of the MEC method. However, the specific bird sound datasets used are not mentioned in the context.

Therefore, the ImageNet database and the Darksound dataset are the primary datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context. Additionally, bird sound datasets, such as those used in the BirdNET algorithm, are mentioned as potentially useful for improving the feature extraction capabilities of the CNN backbones.
