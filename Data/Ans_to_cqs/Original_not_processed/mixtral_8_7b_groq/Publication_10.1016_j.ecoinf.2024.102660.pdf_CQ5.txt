Answer:::
In the deep learning pipeline described in the provided context, a specific dataset called the WSGD (Water Surface Glint Detection) dataset was used. The WSGD dataset is a collection of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) water image pairs, which were utilized for training, validating, and testing the Res_AUNet network. The Res_AUNet network is a modified U-Net convolutional neural network designed for water sun glint detection in UAV water images.

The WSGD dataset consisted of 1764 image pairs in total, which were reduced from the original dataset through a cropping process. These image pairs were divided into three subsets: 1232 image pairs for training, 176 image pairs for validating the model accuracy during training, and 356 image pairs for testing the performance of the trained network post-training.

The authors of the study used the WSGD dataset to evaluate the Res_AUNet network's performance, achieving metrics with an Accuracy of 98.02%, an F1-score of 83.67%, and an IOU (Intersection over Union) of 74.73%. These results demonstrate the precision of the proposed method for water sun glint detection in UAV water images, offering valuable insights for effectively eliminating water sun glint and determining the optimal timing for UAV water image acquisition.

In summary, the WSGD dataset, a collection of UAV water image pairs, was used in the deep learning pipeline to train, validate, and test the Res_AUNet network for water sun glint detection.
