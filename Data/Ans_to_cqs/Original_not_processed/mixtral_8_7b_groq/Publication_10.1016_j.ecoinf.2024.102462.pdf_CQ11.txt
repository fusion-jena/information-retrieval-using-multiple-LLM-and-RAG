I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text describes a study involving deep learning models for sub-alpine shrub species identification, including details about fieldwork expeditions and an observer study. However, it does not specify the data repository or data availability for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. For more information on the data repository, I would recommend contacting the authors or checking the related publications where the study was published.
