Answer: The data formats used in the deep learning pipelines for drought assessment, prediction, and analysis, as described in the provided context, are primarily time series data in the form of CSV files. These CSV files contain various influencing factors related to drought propagation, such as climate data, soil moisture, and vegetation health indices.

In the study by Kaur and Sood (2020), a deep learning-based drought assessment and prediction framework was developed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). While the format of the data used in this study is not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred from the nature of the CNN that the data is likely presented in a gridded format, possibly as raster images (e.g., GeoTIFF) representing spatial data or time series data presented in a structured matrix format.

The study by Kennett et al. (2022) investigates the relationship between drought and civil conflict among the ancient Maya. The data used in this study includes archaeological, climatological, and paleoclimatological records, which are likely stored in structured formats such as CSV or tabular databases.

The study by Khorram and Jehbez (2023) presents a hybrid CNN-LSTM approach for monthly reservoir inflow forecasting. The input data for this study is time series data, most likely in the form of CSV files, containing historical reservoir inflow, meteorological, and hydrological data.

Li et al. (2016) discuss the impact of drought on civilizations along the ancient Silk Road. The data used in this study includes paleoclimatic records, archaeological evidence, and historical documents, which are likely stored in various formats, including text files, databases, and spreadsheets.

In summary, time series data in the form of CSV files and spatial data in raster formats (e.g., GeoTIFF) are the primary data formats used in the deep learning pipelines for drought assessment, prediction, and analysis. Other data formats, such as text files, databases, and spreadsheets, may also be used depending on the specific study and the nature of the data being analyzed.
