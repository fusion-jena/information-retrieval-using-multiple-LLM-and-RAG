Answer:

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study titled "Lake total suspended matter retrieval by wind speed: A machine learning model trained by time-series satellite imagery" published in the Ecological Informatics journal. The study was conducted by researchers from Kharazmi University and Islamic Azad University in Tehran, Iran.

The paper describes the development of a machine learning model called Wind2TSM-Net, which predicts the concentration of Total Suspended Matter (TSM) in lake water based on wind speed measurements and satellite imagery. However, the context does not mention where the code for this deep learning pipeline is available.

It is a common practice for researchers to share their code and data through repositories like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket to promote transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in research. However, in this case, the information about the code repository is not provided in the given context.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query. It is recommended to contact the authors of the study directly to inquire about the availability of the code repository.
