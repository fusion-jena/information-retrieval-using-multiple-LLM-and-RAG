Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. However, it is mentioned that data augmentation techniques were used to boost the diversity of the dataset, which included modifications in brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue, along with random horizontal and vertical flips, and random rotations up to thirty degrees. Additionally, Gaussian noise was incorporated to improve the robustness of the model in different conditions.

It is also mentioned that the preprocessing pipeline involved reducing the images to a workable scale of 224 Ã— 2
