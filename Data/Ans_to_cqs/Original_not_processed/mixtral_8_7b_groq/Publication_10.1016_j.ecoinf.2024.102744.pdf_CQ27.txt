The context provided does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the models were trained using PyTorch, TensorFlow, and OpenCV libraries in a Python 3.10 environment on a server with a specific CPU and GPU configuration.

Answer:::
While the context gives information about the training of the models, it does not explicitly mention the steps taken to deploy them. Typically, deploying a deep learning model involves steps such as model serialization (saving the model architecture and weights to disk), platform selection (choosing the hardware and software environment where the model will run), and integration with an application or service that uses the model for inference.

Answer:::
The context does provide some information about the model architecture, such as the number of layers, layer types, and output sizes. For example, the classification network used in Method 1 has convolution, pooling, dropout, and dense layers, with an input size of 224x224 and an output size of 1000. This information could be useful in selecting an appropriate platform for deployment.

Answer:::
Additionally, the context provides a table comparing the number of parameters, GFLOPs, and inference time of various models used in the experiments. This information could be useful in selecting a model that balances accuracy and performance for a given deployment scenario.

Answer:::
However, without more specific information about the deployment process, it is not possible to provide a detailed answer to this query.
