Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning model being used in the described process. The computing tools mentioned are used for implementing Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Least Squares (LS) method, as well as the MCMC algorithm. These methods are used for optimization and exploration of the parameters' space, and for solving ordinary differential equations (ODE) systems.

The purpose of the GA is to partially optimize the results of the estimation and to better explore the space of the parameters. The GA is based on an iterative optimization, and the first quarter of the best fit parameter values stored in the database is considered as input for the process.

The MCMC algorithm is used for sampling from a multidimensional distribution and it is used to solve the ODE system. The algorithm provides for the following steps: selecting a random row of the genetic algorithm output database, absorbing the best parameter values, generating random values from the Gaussian distribution associated with each parameter, solving the ODE system, and absorbing the array of experimental data for comparison between the ODE model output and the experimental data.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is not clear as it is not mentioned in the given text.
