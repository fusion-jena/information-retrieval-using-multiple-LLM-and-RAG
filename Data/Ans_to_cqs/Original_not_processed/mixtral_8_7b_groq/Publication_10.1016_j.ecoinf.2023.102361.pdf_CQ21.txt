Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of post-processing steps such as saliency maps or calculating specific metrics after the model training phase. However, there is a description of how the model predicts the class label for each image.

After training, the deep learning models are used to predict the class label for each image. This is done by dividing the image into patches, predicting the class label for each patch, and then using a weighted majority voting technique to predict the class label of the entire image. The important patches are selected using an approach mentioned in Section 2.6.3, but the specifics of this approach are not provided in the context.

Additionally, the context does mention that the performance of the models is evaluated using the remaining 20% of the dataset, which was set aside for testing. However, the specific evaluation metrics used are not mentioned. Common evaluation metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit details on post-processing steps such as saliency maps or specific evaluation metrics, it does describe how the model predicts the class label for each image using patch-based prediction and weighted majority voting. The performance of the models is evaluated using a reserved test set, but the specific metrics used are not mentioned.
