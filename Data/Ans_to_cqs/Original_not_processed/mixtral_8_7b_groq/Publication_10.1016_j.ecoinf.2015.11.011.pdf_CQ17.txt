The provided context does not contain information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The text discusses the use of segmentation and classification strategies, pre-processing of imagery, and opportunities of the modeling approach in the context of ecological informatics and historical ecology. However, it does not provide specific details about regularization techniques in deep learning. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
