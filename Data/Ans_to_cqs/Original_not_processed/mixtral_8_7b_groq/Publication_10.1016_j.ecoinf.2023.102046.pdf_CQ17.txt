Answer:::

The regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, as mentioned in the provided context, include L2 regularization and dropout.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a method that adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is the square of the L2-norm of the model's weights. This penalty term discourages large weight values, which can help to reduce overfitting. In the context, L2 regularization is used in ridge regression and support vector machines (SVMs) implemented in Scikit-learn.

Dropout is another regularization technique that is used to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out, or setting to zero, a proportion of the neurons in a layer during training. This helps to prevent co-adaptation of neurons and encourages the model to learn more robust features. However, the provided context does not mention the use of dropout in any of the models.

In addition to L2 regularization and dropout, other regularization methods that can be used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines include early stopping, data augmentation, and weight initialization. Early stopping involves stopping the training process before the model starts to overfit, based on a validation set. Data augmentation involves artificially increasing the size of the training set by applying random transformations to the existing data. Weight initialization methods, such as Xavier initialization, can help to ensure that the weights of the model are initialized with appropriate values, which can also help to prevent overfitting.

In summary, L2 regularization and dropout are two regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. While the provided context only mentions the use of L2 regularization, other regularization methods such as early stopping, data augmentation, and weight initialization can also be used to prevent overfitting.
