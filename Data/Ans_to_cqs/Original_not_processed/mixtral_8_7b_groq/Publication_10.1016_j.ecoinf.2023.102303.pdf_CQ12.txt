Answer:::

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), specifically the EfficientNet-B7 model. This is mentioned in the second piece of context, which states that "The first model selected is EfficientNet-B7, which is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with efficient scaling factors." CNNs are a type of neural network that are particularly well-suited to image classification tasks, as they are able to effectively process the spatial information in images. The EfficientNet-B7 model is a state-of-the-art CNN that has been shown to achieve high accuracy on a variety of image classification tasks. In this pipeline, it is used as part of a semi-supervised contrastive learning approach for classifying fish in turbid waters.
