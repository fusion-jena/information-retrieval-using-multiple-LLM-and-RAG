Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, the context does discuss the importance of coherence metrics in ecoacoustic data analysis, which can be relevant for monitoring and evaluating model performance.

In the context, coherence metrics are used to identify frequency bands where different recorders show comparable performance. This is important because there can be variability in frequency responses due to manufacturing conditions, wear, and model differences. By identifying comparable frequency bands, one can adjust for these variances in the analysis of ecoacoustic data and ensure more reliable acoustic index evaluations.

In the case of model performance monitoring during training, coherence metrics could be applied to compare the model's output with reference data or ground truth. By evaluating the model's performance across different frequency bands, one can identify the frequency ranges where the model's output is most comparable to the reference data. This information can then be used to adjust the model or the analysis process to improve the model's performance in other frequency bands.

In summary, while there is no direct information on the strategy used to monitor model performance during training, the context suggests that coherence metrics could be employed to compare the model's output with reference data and identify frequency bands where the model's performance is most reliable. This information could then be used to adjust the model or the analysis process to improve overall performance.
