The generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through several measures. Firstly, the model was trained using a large and diverse dataset. The dataset consisted of various parameters such as the number of bands, number of frames, hop length, and length of the FFT window. This diversity in the dataset helped the model to learn a wide range of features and patterns, thereby improving its ability to generalize to unseen data.

Secondly, the model's performance was evaluated using stratified 10-fold cross-validation. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance of a model by dividing the dataset into multiple subsets or folds. The model is then trained and tested on each fold, and the performance metrics are averaged across all folds. Stratified sampling ensures that each fold contains a representative distribution of the target variable, which further enhances the model's generalizability.

Thirdly, the standard deviation values for each performance indicator were compared to determine the optimal configuration. Configuration 8 was determined as the ideal parameter owing to its reduced standard deviation value. This indicates that the model's performance is consistent and reliable across different configurations, thereby increasing its generalizability.

Lastly, the feature extraction parameters that yielded the best performance were employed during the feature extraction phase in the optimization process of the CNN deep learning model. The model optimization outcomes were derived using performance criteria identical to those employed to optimize feature extraction parameters. This ensured that the model's optimization is consistent and robust, thereby enhancing its generalizability.

In conclusion, the generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, stratified splitting, and optimization of feature extraction parameters. These measures helped to improve the model's ability to learn and generalize to unseen data, thereby increasing its accuracy and reliability.
