Based on the provided context, the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model were not mentioned. The text focuses on the process and methodology of developing a deep learning model for classifying corals and non-corals in marine images, rather than the technical details of the hardware used for training.

However, it is mentioned that the activation vectors of the first fully connected layer of a pre-trained VGGnet were employed as feature representations, and these features were used to train a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) network for classification. VGGnet is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) that is known to require significant computational resources, including GPUs, for training. Therefore, it can be inferred that GPUs were likely used for training the deep learning model in this study, but the specific type and number of GPUs are not provided in the context.

Additionally, the use of spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) and Multi-scale Orderless Pooling (MOP) schemes suggests that the model was designed to be computationally efficient and robust for diverse classification and recognition applications. These techniques allow the CNN to be independent of the input image size, which can reduce the computational requirements for training the model.

In summary, while the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model are not provided in the context, it can be inferred that GPUs were likely used due to the complexity of the VGGnet architecture. The use of SPP and MOP techniques also suggests that the model was designed to be computationally efficient.
