Based on the provided context, there is no explicit description of the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it can be inferred that the LSTM model's performance is likely monitored using techniques appropriate for recurrent neural networks and other machine learning models.

In general, monitoring model performance during training involves tracking metrics such as loss, accuracy, or other relevant measures to ensure that the model is learning effectively and not overfitting or underfitting the data. For time series prediction models like the LSTM model, it is common to monitor the performance on a validation set, which is a separate subset of the data not used in training. This allows for an unbiased evaluation of the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Furthermore, the context suggests that the LSTM model is used in the forecasting of ecological water demand in an arid oasis under a drying climate scenario. In this context, monitoring the model performance during training might involve comparing the model's predictions to actual data or expert knowledge of the underlying ecological processes.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly describe the strategy for monitoring the model performance during training, it is likely that standard techniques for monitoring machine learning models are used, such as tracking performance on a validation set and comparing predictions to actual data or expert knowledge.
