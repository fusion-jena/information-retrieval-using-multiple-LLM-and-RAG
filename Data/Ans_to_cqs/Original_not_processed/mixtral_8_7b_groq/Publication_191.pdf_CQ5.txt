Answer: The text provided does not give information about the use of standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet in the deep learning pipeline it describes. However, it does mention several other datasets that are used in this pipeline.

The deep learning pipeline in question involves training deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for plant species classification. To train these networks, the authors use a dataset called PlantClef2015, which contains around 113,205 images and has one of the largest numbers of object categories (10) among the datasets mentioned. However, the authors note that this dataset is still much smaller than general major datasets for images, videos, or languages, and that this limits the optimization capability of their deep CNN networks.

In addition to PlantClef2015, the authors use several other datasets to pre-train their networks. These include LeafSnap, HCF, HCF-ScaleRobust, and Combine for leaf data, and SIFT for feature extraction. They also use four other datasets, MS COCO, Places2, Sport-1M, and Visual Genome QA, but it is not clear from the text how they are used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, while the text provides information about several datasets used in the deep learning pipeline it describes, it does not mention any of the standard datasets commonly used in deep learning research, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
