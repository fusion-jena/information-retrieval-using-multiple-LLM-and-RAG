The provided context does not include specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of the CA-Hybrid network, which is a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT). While the context does not explicitly mention regularization techniques, it is worth noting that both CNN and ViT architectures have been known to use regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out a proportion of neurons during training, preventing over-reliance on specific neurons and thus reducing overfitting (Srivastava et al., 2014). L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages smaller weight values, which can help prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model (Goodfellow et al., 2016).

In the context of the CA-Hybrid network, it is possible that dropout or L2 regularization were used within the CNN and/or ViT modules to prevent overfitting. However, without explicit information, it is not possible to confirm this. It is also possible that other regularization techniques were used, or that the dataset and model architecture were designed in such a way as to minimize the risk of overfitting without the need for explicit regularization methods.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, it is possible that dropout or L2 regularization were used within the CNN and/or ViT modules of the CA-Hybrid network. However, without further information, this cannot be confirmed.
