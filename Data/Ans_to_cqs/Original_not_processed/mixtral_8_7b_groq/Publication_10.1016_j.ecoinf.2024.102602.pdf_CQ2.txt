Answer: The deep learning pipeline in the context provided primarily uses image data for training and testing the models. More specifically, the images are resized to a standard resolution of 227x197 pixels and normalized to a range of [0,1] before being fed into the models. This preprocessing is done to ensure consistency and compatibility of the input data with the selected deep learning models.

The specific image data formats used in the study are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the images are in a digital format that allows for resizing and normalization. Common image data formats include JPEG, PNG, and TIFF, among others.

It is important to note that the deep learning pipeline in this study focuses on the classification of a specific plant species, Cortaderia selloana, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Therefore, the data format used is specific to this task and may vary for other deep learning applications.

The context also mentions the potential use of other forms of online data, such as textual information (e.g., tags, captions, comments), to further improve the generalization of deep learning tools for invasive alien species detection, mapping, and monitoring. However, the use of these data formats is not explored in the study and is presented as a potential area for future research.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in the provided context primarily uses image data in an unspecified digital format for training and testing CNNs for the classification of a specific plant species. Other data formats, such as textual information, may also be used to improve the generalization of deep learning tools for invasive alien species detection, mapping, and monitoring.
