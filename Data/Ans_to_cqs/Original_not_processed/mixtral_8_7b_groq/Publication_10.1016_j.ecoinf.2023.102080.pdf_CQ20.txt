Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The text describes a study that compares the computation time needed for different ecological data analysis procedures using a 10-core central processing unit (CPU) strategy with AMDÂ® EPYC 7402 on the University of Lausanne HPC cluster. However, it does not mention the use of graphics processing units (GPUs) or tensor processing units (TPUs) for training deep learning models.

The covsel package, which is the focus of the study, provides functions for collinearity filtering and model-specific embedding of ecological data. The package includes a function called covsel.embed() that can be used for model-specific embedding, but it does not specify whether it utilizes GPUs or TPUs for deep learning model training.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the hardware resources used for training deep learning models.
