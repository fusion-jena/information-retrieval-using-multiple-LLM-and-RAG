The provided context does not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for water contamination classification in aquaculture. The research papers mentioned in the context focus on the application of deep learning techniques for water quality analysis, but they do not explicitly state the use of standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

Instead, the studies use IoT-based real-time data collection for temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate concentration in aquaculture systems. These datasets are likely to be domain-specific and related to the aquaculture environment. For example, Bisht et al. (2017) developed an automated water quality classification model for the River Ganga using water quality parameters like pH, dissolved oxygen, and total dissolved solids. Similarly, Barzegar et al. (2020) used a hybrid CNN-LSTM deep learning model for short-term water quality variable prediction, with inputs such as pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen.

In summary, the context does not provide information on standard datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the research focuses on IoT-based real-time data collection for water quality parameters specific to aquaculture systems.
