Answer:
The provided context does not include information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context focuses on the performance metrics and deep learning models used for plant disease classification, including DenseNet201, ResNet50v2, Inceptionresnetv2, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB3, and various ensembles of these models.

The performance metrics mentioned include accuracy, precision, and recall, which are used to evaluate the performance of the models. However, the context does not provide information on how the data was split into training, testing, and validation sets, which is an important aspect of deep learning model training.

Data splitting is typically done to evaluate the performance of the model and prevent overfitting. A common approach is to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

In conclusion, while the provided context gives a detailed explanation of the deep learning models and performance metrics used for plant disease classification, it does not provide information on the criteria used to split the data for model training.
