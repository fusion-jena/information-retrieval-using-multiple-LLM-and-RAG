Answer:::
The provided context does not directly answer the query regarding the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a dataset recorded at a different location and expanded gradually until reconstructions were sufficiently good. This suggests that the data was collected using some form of sensors or recording devices.

In general, the methods for collecting raw data in deep learning can vary widely depending on the specific application. Some common sources of data include surveys, sensors, public datasets, and user-generated content. Surveys can be used to collect data through direct questioning of individuals, while sensors can measure various physical phenomena such as temperature, pressure, or sound. Public datasets are often made available by research institutions, government agencies, or other organizations, and can cover a wide range of topics from images and text to scientific measurements. User-generated content, such as social media posts or product reviews, can also be a rich source of data for deep learning applications.

Once the raw data is collected, it is typically preprocessed and cleaned to remove any errors or inconsistencies. This may involve steps such as normalization, feature extraction, and data augmentation. After preprocessing, the data is used to train deep learning models, which can learn patterns and relationships within the data.

In the context of variational autoencoders (VAEs), the raw data is represented as input data with N samples and F features, denoted as x ∈ ℝN×F. The probabilistic encoder of a VAE maps this input data to the posterior density p(z|x) over the latent variable, z ∈ ℝN×L. The decoder then reconstructs the input data from the latent variable, denoted by pφ(x|z).

Overall, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data, it is clear that some form of data collection and preprocessing is necessary for deep learning applications.
