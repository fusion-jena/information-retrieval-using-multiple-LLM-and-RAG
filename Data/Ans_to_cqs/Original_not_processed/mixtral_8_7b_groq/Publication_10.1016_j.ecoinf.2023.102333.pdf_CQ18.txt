Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of learning and loss curves, as well as the evaluation of the model's behavior on training and validation datasets.

First, learning curves were used to diagnose the learning performance of the models over time. The training accuracy curve provides insight into how the model is learning, while the validation accuracy gives insight into the generalizing process. Similarly, the training loss curve shows the model’s performance on the training data when the optimization algorithm adjusts the model parameters to minimize the loss function. The validation loss curve measures the model’s performance on new unseen data.

Moreover, the Hyperband method plots showed a non-smooth pattern with irregular values, indicating that the model had difficulty learning the data patterns. The training loss curve and validation loss curve crossed, meaning that the model performed differently on the training dataset than on the validation dataset. This behavior suggests that the model overfitted by showing good performance in the training dataset but failing to generalize onto the validation dataset. Overfitting occurs when the model is too complex and captures noise in the training data instead of the underlying patterns.

Furthermore, the training and validation accuracy curves are closer to the Hyperband than the Bayesian optimization method, indicating that the Hyperband method may have provided better performance in this particular case.

In summary, the strategy to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of learning and loss curves, as well as the evaluation of the model's behavior on training and validation datasets. The Hyperband method was used to optimize the model's hyperparameters, and its performance was compared to the Bayesian optimization method. The Hyperband method showed a more stable learning pattern and better performance on the training and validation datasets, suggesting that it may be a more effective strategy for monitoring model performance during training.
