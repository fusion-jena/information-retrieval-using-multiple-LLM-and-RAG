Answer:::

The provided context does not mention which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model, if any. The text discusses the use of various models and techniques for land use and land cover (LULC) simulation and carbon sequestration valuation, but it does not specify where these models were implemented. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to determine if a deep learning model was used or where it might have been deployed.
