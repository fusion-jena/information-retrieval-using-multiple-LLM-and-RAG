Based on the provided context, there is no specific strategy mentioned for monitoring the model performance during training for either the Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) or Support Vector Machine (SVM) models. However, there are some general strategies that are commonly used to monitor model performance during training in machine learning.

One such strategy is to use a validation set, which is a subset of the training data that is held out and used to evaluate the model's performance during training. The model's performance on the validation set is monitored throughout the training process, and if the performance starts to degrade or the model begins to overfit, the training process can be stopped early. This approach is useful for preventing overfitting and ensuring that the model generalizes well to new data.

Another strategy is to use learning curves, which are plots of the model's performance as a function of the training set size. Learning curves can help identify whether the model is underfitting or overfitting, and can provide insights into how much more data is needed to improve the model's performance.

In the context of the SVM model, there are some specific considerations for monitoring model performance during training. For example, the choice of kernel function and kernel parameters can have a significant impact on the model's performance, and these parameters may need to be adjusted during training to optimize the model's performance. Additionally, the SVM model's performance can be sensitive to the choice of regularization parameter, which controls the tradeoff between model complexity and fit to the training data.

For the BPNN model, monitoring the model's performance during training typically involves tracking the model's error or loss function, as well as monitoring the weights and biases of the neurons in the network. If the error or loss function does not decrease or the weights and biases become too large, this can indicate that the model is overfitting or that the learning rate is too high.

Overall, while the provided context does not specify a particular strategy for monitoring the model performance during training, there are several general strategies that are commonly used in machine learning, and some specific considerations for the SVM and BPNN models.
