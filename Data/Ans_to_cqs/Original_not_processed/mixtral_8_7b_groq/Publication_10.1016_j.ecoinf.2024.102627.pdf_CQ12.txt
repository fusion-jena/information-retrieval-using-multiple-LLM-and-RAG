Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly specified in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model is a neural network optimized using a cross-entropy loss function. The input to the model is a large environmental context, including WorldClim2 bioclimatic variables, Soilgrids pedological variables, human footprint rasters, terrestrial ecoregions of the world, and the observation location (longitude and latitude). These inputs are provided as 64 × 64 2D tensors sampled at the kilometre-scale resolution. The model's output is the assemblage of predicted species, obtained by thresholding the softmax probabilities.

Based on the information provided, it is challenging to determine the exact type of neural network used. The model could be a simple feedforward neural network, a convolutional neural network (CNN), or a recurrent neural network (RNN), among others. The use of 2D tensors and the lack of information about temporal data suggest that an RNN may be less likely. However, CNNs are commonly used for image-like data, and the 64 × 64 2D tensors could be interpreted as image data. Therefore, a CNN is a possible candidate for the type of neural network used in this pipeline.

In summary, while the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that the model is a neural network optimized using a cross-entropy loss function. The input to the model is a large environmental context, and the output is the assemblage of predicted species. Based on the information provided, a CNN is a possible candidate for the type of neural network used in this pipeline.
