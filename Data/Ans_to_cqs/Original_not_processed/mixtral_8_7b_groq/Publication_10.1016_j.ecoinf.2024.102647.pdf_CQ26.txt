Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the text does not explicitly mention the techniques used for addressing data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of data for training machine learning algorithms and the importance of acknowledging data scarcity. It also highlights the significance of feature selection in improving understanding and decision-making outcomes.

That being said, some common techniques for addressing data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the data into subgroups based on specific features, such as gender or age, and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to ensure that each group is represented in the training, validation, and test sets.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of a particular subgroup in the dataset to ensure that it is adequately represented in the training, validation, and test sets.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of a particular subgroup in the dataset to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model can generalize to new data.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population being studied.

While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, they are commonly used in the field of machine learning and deep learning to address data bias and ensure that models are fair, accurate, and reliable.
