Answer:

The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. However, it can be inferred that the training was likely done on a machine with a sufficient computational capacity to handle large neural networks, since models such as Inception-V3, DenseNet-121, ResNet-18, and MobileNet-V2 were trained. These models have a considerable number of parameters and require substantial computational power.

The training process involved the use of the Keras library, which is a high-level neural networks API, capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. TensorFlow, one of the possible backends, can run on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). Given the complexity of the models and the fact that deep learning training often benefits from parallel processing offered by GPUs or TPUs, it is plausible that either a GPU or a TPU was used for training. Nonetheless, the specific hardware resource cannot be definitively determined from the context.
