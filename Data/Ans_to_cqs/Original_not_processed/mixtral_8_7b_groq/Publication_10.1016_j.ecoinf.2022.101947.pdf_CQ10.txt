Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context includes various citations and page numbers from different research articles related to ecological informatics and conservation studies, mainly focusing on Amur tigers and leopards. There are also some lists of volumes, lines, and areas, as well as a citation of a paper about the effects of trapping effort and trap shyness on estimates of tiger abundance from camera trap studies. However, there is no mention of any deep learning pipeline or its code repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
