Answer:::
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the necessary information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the use of deep learning models for remote sensing applications, specifically for tropical forest monitoring and agricultural landscape mapping. However, it does not mention or provide a link to any data repository used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
