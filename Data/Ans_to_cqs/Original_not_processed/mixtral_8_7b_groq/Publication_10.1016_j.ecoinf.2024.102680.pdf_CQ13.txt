Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in deep learning models can vary depending on the specific model and algorithm being used. However, some common hyperparameters include the learning rate and the optimizer.

In the context provided, the authors used the MMDetection framework to train various object detection algorithms, including YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and their own detector (UODN). The hyperparameter settings for these algorithms are detailed in Table 2, which includes the optimizer and learning rate used for each algorithm.

For example, the YOLOv8 algorithm uses the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. Similarly, the UODN algorithm uses the adaptive moment estimation weight decay (AdamW) optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001.

It's worth noting that the authors had to train the various networks using the default parameters preset in the MMDetection framework until the algorithms fully converged, as the varying structures of different object detection algorithms may not achieve optimal results using a uniform set of hyperparameters.

In addition to the learning rate and optimizer, other hyperparameters that can be used in deep learning models include the batch size, the number of epochs, the regularization method, and the loss function. The specific hyperparameters used will depend on the task and dataset being used.

Overall, the choice of hyperparameters can have a significant impact on the performance of deep learning models, and hyperparameter tuning is an important step in the model training process.
