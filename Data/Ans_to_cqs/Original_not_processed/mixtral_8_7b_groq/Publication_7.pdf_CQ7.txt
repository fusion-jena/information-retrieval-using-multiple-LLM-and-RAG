Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that a subset of the Benthoz15 dataset, containing images from Western Australia (WA), was used to train the classifier. This subset consists of 4,750 images with 237,500 expert-annotated points collected over a span of 3 years (2011 to 2013).

In addition, the context describes some pre-processing steps applied to the dataset, such as color channel stretch, but it does not mention any data splitting criteria.

It is important to note that when training deep learning models, it is common practice to split the data into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and make decisions during the training process, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the trained model.

There are various strategies for splitting the data, such as random splitting, stratified sampling, or time-based splitting. The choice of strategy depends on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the problem being addressed.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give specific information about the data splitting criteria used in this case, it is likely that a standard approach was followed, involving the creation of separate training, validation, and testing subsets.
