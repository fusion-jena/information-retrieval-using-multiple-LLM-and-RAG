Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, as described in the provided context, involves dividing the ground-truth dataset randomly into three sets: training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%). This division of the imagery allows for a good-sized validation and test dataset for evaluating the model's accuracy, while maximizing the training set.

During the training process, each image is subset and cropped into 6 overlapping patches matching the output size of the network (388 Ã— 388 pixels). This results in a total training set size of 379 images. The random division of the dataset into training, validation, and test sets is a common practice in machine learning to assess the model's performance and generalization capabilities.

The validation set is used during the training phase to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance. It helps to tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting by providing a means to assess the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. The test set, on the other hand, is used to evaluate the final model's performance after training. It provides an independent assessment of the model's ability to make predictions on new, unseen data.

In summary, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in the provided context involves dividing the ground-truth dataset randomly into training, validation, and test sets, with a ratio of 80:10:10. This division of the dataset, along with the use of overlapping patches during training, allows for a robust evaluation of the model's performance and generalization capabilities.
