Answer:

The provided context discusses the limitations of the classification model, its application to a real wildfire, and proposed modifications to improve the model. However, it does not explicitly mention any strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.

The text does mention the intention to modify the update criterion to make it differentiable, which could potentially help in tracking the model's performance. Making the update criterion differentiable would allow for the use of machine-learning tools, which often include methods for monitoring model performance.

Furthermore, the plan to optimize the scope by adjusting partitions could also indirectly contribute to monitoring model performance. By increasing the number of cells exposed in each iteration, the model's behavior becomes more observable, which could help in identifying any issues during training.

However, these are potential strategies that could be implemented in the future. The current text does not provide any information about a strategy that is already in place to monitor the model's performance during training.
