Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about which frameworks are used to build the deep learning model for the studies mentioned. The sources mainly focus on the study areas, methods, and results related to ecological informatics, urban climate, land cover change, carbon stock, and terrestrial ecosystem sensitivity to climate change.

The sources cited are:
1. "Intertwined impacts of urbanization and land cover change on urban climate and agriculture in Aurangabad city (MS), India using google earth engine platform." This study uses the Google Earth Engine platform for analysis but does not mention any deep learning frameworks.
2. "Estimating biomass of savanna grasslands as a proxy of carbon stock using multispectral remote sensing." This paper focuses on estimating biomass and carbon stock using remote sensing data and does not involve deep learning models or their frameworks.
3. "Spatial and temporal variation of phenological growing season and climate change impacts in temperate eastern China." This study investigates the phenological growing season and climate change impacts, without mentioning deep learning models or their frameworks.
4. "Assessment of terrestrial ecosystem sensitivity to climate change in arid, semi-arid, sub-humid, and humid regions using EVI, LAI, and SIF products." This paper analyzes terrestrial ecosystem sensitivity to climate change using various products but does not mention deep learning frameworks.

Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to the query using the given context.
