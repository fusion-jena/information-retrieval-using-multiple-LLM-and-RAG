Answer:::

The provided context does not give a detailed explanation of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of the Keras library, which is an open-source neural network library written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. This suggests that the deep learning model was likely trained using one of these backend engines and then deployed using Keras.

Moreover, the context also mentions that the deep learning technique significantly increased prediction accuracy in soil carbon prediction and has the potential to be a valuable technique for ecological analysis. This implies that the trained deep learning model was used for predictive modeling and was deployed in an environment where it could make predictions based on new data.

In terms of model serialization, the context does not provide specific information about how the trained model was saved and loaded. However, Keras provides built-in functions for saving and loading models, including the ability to save the model architecture, weights, and optimizer state. This allows for easy model serialization and deployment in different environments.

As for platform selection, the context does not provide information on where the model was deployed or what hardware and software requirements were necessary for deployment. However, Keras can be used to deploy models on a variety of platforms, including local machines, clusters, and cloud-based services such as AWS and Google Cloud.

In summary, while the provided context does not give a detailed explanation of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it does suggest that the model was trained using Keras and one of its backend engines and was deployed for predictive modeling. The context also implies that the model was easily serializable and could be deployed on a variety of platforms. However, more specific information about the deployment process would be necessary to provide a more complete answer.
