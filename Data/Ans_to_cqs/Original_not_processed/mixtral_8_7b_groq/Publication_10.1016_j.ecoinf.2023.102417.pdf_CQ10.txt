 The provided context does not include information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the application of deep learning methods for biological soil crust classification and monitoring, but it does not mention any specific code repository or platform such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket where the pipeline's code can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
