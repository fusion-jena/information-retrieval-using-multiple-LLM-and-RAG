The data for the deep learning pipeline is published on Kaggle and is available at <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/llll00/urbansound8k> and <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/llll00/birdsdata>. Kaggle is a popular platform for data sharing and analysis, particularly in the field of machine learning. It provides a user-friendly interface for data access and allows users to explore, download, and contribute to datasets. However, it is not one of the traditional repositories for data archiving and sharing, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.

While Kaggle offers a convenient solution for accessing the data used in the deep learning pipeline, it may not meet the requirements for data citation and long-term preservation. For researchers who need to comply with data management policies or wish to ensure the reproducibility of their work, it is advisable to deposit the data in a recognized repository and obtain a persistent identifier, such as a DOI.

In summary, the data for the deep learning pipeline is available on Kaggle, but it may not be suitable for all use cases. Researchers who require a more formal data repository should consider depositing the data in a recognized platform.
