Answer:::

The provided context does not contain specific information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline for the study in question. However, I can provide a general overview of some common techniques used to address data bias in machine learning and deep learning.

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria (like class labels) and then ensuring that each subgroup is proportionally represented in the training, validation, and testing sets. This method helps maintain the original distribution of the data and prevents bias during model training.

2. Oversampling: When a particular class or subgroup is underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to balance the data. This technique involves creating more instances of the underrepresented class, either by replicating existing instances or using data augmentation techniques.

3. Undersampling: In contrast to oversampling, undersampling reduces the number of instances in the overrepresented class or subgroup. This method helps balance the dataset, but it may lead to loss of valuable information.

4. Diverse data collection: Addressing data bias starts with collecting diverse and representative data. Researchers should aim to gather data from various sources, locations, and conditions to ensure that the dataset captures the inherent variability of the target population.

5. Preprocessing techniques: Various preprocessing techniques, like normalization, standardization, and feature scaling, can help reduce data bias by ensuring that all features contribute equally to the model's learning process.

Without specific information from the provided context, it is impossible to determine which techniques were used in the study. However, researchers often mention the techniques they used in the "Methods" or "Data Preprocessing" sections of their papers.
