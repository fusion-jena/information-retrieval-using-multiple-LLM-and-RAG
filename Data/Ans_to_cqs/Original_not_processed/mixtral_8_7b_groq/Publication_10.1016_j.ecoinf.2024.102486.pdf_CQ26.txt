The provided context discusses various computational statistics techniques and parallel computing, but it does not directly mention techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general information about common techniques used to address data bias in machine learning.

Addressing data bias is crucial in machine learning to ensure that the model does not learn and perpetuate the existing biases in the data. Some common techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing include:

1. **Stratified sampling**: Stratified sampling is a method of sampling where the population is divided into subgroups or strata based on some criteria, and then a sample is taken from each stratum. This method ensures that the sample is representative of the entire population and helps to reduce bias.
2. **Oversampling**: Oversampling is a technique used when the minority class in a dataset is underrepresented. In oversampling, the minority class is sampled multiple times to increase its representation in the dataset. However, oversampling can lead to overfitting, and hence, techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) are used, which creates synthetic examples instead of simply replicating the existing ones.
3. **Undersampling**: Undersampling is a technique used when the majority class in a dataset is overrepresented. In undersampling, a subset of the majority class is selected to balance the dataset. However, this technique can lead to loss of information, and hence, ensemble methods like EasyEnsemble or BalancedCascade are used.
4. **Diverse data collection**: Collecting diverse data is crucial to ensure that the model does not learn and perpetuate existing biases. Diverse data collection involves gathering data from various sources, including different demographics, locations, and scenarios.

In summary, addressing data bias during preprocessing is crucial in machine learning to ensure that the model does not learn and perpetuate the existing biases in the data. Some common techniques used to address data bias include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
