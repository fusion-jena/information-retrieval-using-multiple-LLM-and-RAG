Answer:
The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for the study titled "Extreme deep learning in biosecurity: the case of machine hearing for marine species identification". However, it can be inferred that the data used in this study is related to marine species identification and might have been collected using underwater sensors or hydrophones. This is because the study uses a machine hearing approach, which involves processing and analyzing acoustic data to identify marine species. Additionally, the use of geolocation-based services in the study also suggests that the data might include location information, further supporting the idea that the data was collected using sensors or other devices that can capture location and acoustic information. It is also possible that the data was obtained from public datasets related to marine biology and acoustics.
