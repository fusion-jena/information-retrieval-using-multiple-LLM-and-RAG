Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the deep learning model's performance. However, it does mention the use of the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) and the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) as evaluation metrics for the overall modeling process.

The AUC-ROC is a commonly used metric for binary classification problems, measuring the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes. It ranges from 0 to 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates a better performing model.

On the other hand, the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) is employed to assess the model's performance concerning the spatial distribution of the species. It ranges from -1 to 1, where a value closer to 1 indicates a better agreement between the observed and predicted species distribution.

However, the context does not mention other metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall. These metrics are often used for evaluating classification models, with accuracy measuring the proportion of correct predictions, precision measuring the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions, and recall measuring the proportion of true positives among all actual positives.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is unclear which specific metrics were used to evaluate the deep learning model's performance.
