Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for algal blooms forecasting in the Zhoushan fishery. The text focuses on the description of the hybrid CNN-LSTM model architecture, its training process, and the comparison of different solvers for training the network.

However, in the context of remote sensing and satellite data analysis, common data annotation techniques for object detection and segmentation include:

1. Bounding box annotation: Drawing rectangular boxes around objects of interest to define the location and extent of the target in an image.
2. Pixel-level annotation: Labeling each pixel in an image to create a segmentation mask, distinguishing the target object from the background and other objects in the scene.
3. Instance segmentation: A combination of object detection and semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is individually segmented and distinguished from other instances of the same object class.

Given that the study uses satellite data for algal blooms forecasting, it is plausible to assume that some form of data annotation was applied to the satellite imagery. However, the specific annotation techniques are not mentioned in the provided context.

Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for algal blooms forecasting in the Zhoushan fishery. However, based on the general practices in remote sensing and satellite data analysis, it is reasonable to assume that data annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation, pixel-level annotation, or instance segmentation were used.
