Answer:::
The deep learning model mentioned in the provided context is used for classifying three sympatric otter species. The study compares the performance of a model trained on images of all qualities with a model trained only on high-quality prints. The purpose of the deep learning model, in this case, is to assess the potential of utilizing lower quality data effectively in the Footprint Identification Technique (FIT) method. This model's application highlights the value of preserving valuable data from incomplete or suboptimal footprints by using missing value imputation during the data preprocessing pipeline. This approach aims to improve the accuracy of FIT predictions when faced with less-than-ideal field survey conditions.

In summary, the deep learning model in the given context serves the purpose of classifying otter species using footprint images, demonstrating the potential of incorporating lower quality data in wildlife conservation research.
