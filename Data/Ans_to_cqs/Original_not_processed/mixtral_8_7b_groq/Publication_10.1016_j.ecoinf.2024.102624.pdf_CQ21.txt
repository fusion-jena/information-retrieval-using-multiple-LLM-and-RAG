Answer: Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps after model training typically include accuracy assessment measures such as the calculation of metrics and the generation of a confusion matrix. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of saliency maps.

In the given text, the authors describe the accuracy assessment process, which involves splitting the reference dataset into training and testing sets at a 70:30 ratio. During the model building phase, they applied 10-fold cross-validation with three repetitions using the training dataset. This process involves randomly splitting the training dataset into 10 folds, using 9 folds for model training and 1 for testing, and repeating the process until all folds have been used as testing data. This procedure is then repeated twice more, using different random splits. The resulting overall accuracy (OA) distribution models help find the best models with the largest overall accuracy and reflect the reliability of the prediction by showing the range of possible model outcomes.

Furthermore, the authors used the testing dataset to predict the classification accuracy. However, they did not mention generating saliency maps as part of their postprocessing steps. Saliency maps are visualizations used to highlight the important features in the input data that influenced the model's prediction. While not explicitly mentioned, the authors might have used other methods for model interpretation and validation.

In summary, the postprocessing steps after model training, as described in the provided context, primarily involve accuracy assessment measures such as calculating metrics and generating confusion matrices. Saliency maps are not explicitly mentioned in this context.
