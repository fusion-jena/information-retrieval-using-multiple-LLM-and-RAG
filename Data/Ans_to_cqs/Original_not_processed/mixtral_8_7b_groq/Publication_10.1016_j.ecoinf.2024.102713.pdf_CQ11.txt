Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct information given about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the main components of the data platform, including data sources, integration and enrichment processes, validation and loading processes, and analytical fruition. However, it does not mention any specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.

The context does mention that the validated data is loaded to the Access tier through an incremental ETL procedure, and the results of these integration and enrichment activities are materialized in the Harbor tier of the data platform. But it does not specify where the data from these tiers is ultimately stored or made accessible for the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query without additional information.
