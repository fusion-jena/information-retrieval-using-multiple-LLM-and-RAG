Answer:::

The training of the models is completed using the early stopping procedure, which monitors the performance on a validation set to prevent overfitting. Specifically, the training process is halted if the validation loss does not improve for a certain number of epochs, which is controlled by the patience parameter. In this case, the patience parameter was set to 10, meaning that if the validation loss did not improve for 10 consecutive epochs, the training would be stopped. This approach allows the models to converge to an optimal point without continuing the training indefinitely, ensuring that the models generalize well to unseen data.
