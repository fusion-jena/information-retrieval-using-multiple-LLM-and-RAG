The provided pieces of context do not directly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do discuss various types of deep learning models and their applications.

In general, data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Image annotation techniques:
- Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image. It is commonly used for object detection tasks.
- Instance segmentation: This technique involves segmenting each instance of an object in an image. It is used for semantic segmentation tasks where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image.
- Semantic segmentation: This technique involves segmenting an image into different regions based on their semantic meaning. It is used for image segmentation tasks where the goal is to classify each region in an image.
2. Text annotation techniques:
- Named entity recognition: This technique involves identifying and categorizing named entities in text, such as people, organizations, and locations.
- Part-of-speech tagging: This technique involves identifying the part of speech for each word in a sentence, such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives.
- Sentiment analysis: This technique involves identifying the sentiment of a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral.

In the context of the provided pieces of research, we can infer that image annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation may have been used in the training of deep learning models for image recognition tasks. For example, in the paper "Comparing recurrent convolutional neural networks for large scale bird species classification" by Gupta et al. (2021), the authors use a dataset of bird images for training their deep learning models. It is likely that the bird images in this dataset were annotated using bounding box annotation or instance segmentation techniques.

Similarly, in the paper "Standardization of imaging features for radiomics analysis" by Haga et al. (2019), the authors use medical images for training their deep learning models. Medical images are often annotated using segmentation techniques to identify regions of interest.

In summary, while the provided pieces of context do not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, we can infer that image annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation and instance segmentation may have been used in the training of deep learning models for image recognition tasks.
