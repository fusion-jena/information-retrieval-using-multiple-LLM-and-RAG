Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link related to it. The references mainly discuss topics such as mining impacts on the environment, soil conditions, and water usage for irrigation. Some of them also mention statistical learning, data mining, and ecohydrologic modeling, but there is no link to a code repository for a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
