Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text does not mention any specific techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization methods.

However, the model described in the context is a Cellular Automata (CA) model based on a multitype random patch seed mechanism (CARS). The model includes various parameters and constraints, such as water area constraints (WAmin ≤ x4 ≤ WAmax), built-up land area constraints (Umin ≤ x5 ≤ Umax), and unused land area constraints (Bmin ≤ x6 ≤ Bmax). The model also includes a transition matrix that defines whether land is allowed to be converted to type c using type k.

Additionally, the model includes a uncertainty analysis section that uses the IFS (Interval Fuzzy Set) method to reflect the uncertainty of numerical values. The IFS method is used to estimate the net crop income, which is affected by fluctuations in crop prices.

However, these parameters and constraints are not hyperparameters, and the optimization of these parameters is not the same as hyperparameter optimization. Hyperparameters are parameters whose values are set before the learning process begins, such as the learning rate, the number of hidden layers in a neural network, or the regularization strength.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
