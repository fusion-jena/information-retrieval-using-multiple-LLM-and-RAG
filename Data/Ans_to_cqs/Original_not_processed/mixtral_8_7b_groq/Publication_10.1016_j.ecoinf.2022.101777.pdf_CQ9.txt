Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The context consists of ecological informatics research articles and discusses topics such as ecological simulations, infiltration capacity, and land use changes in Galicia. The articles do not mention or provide a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the data repository.
