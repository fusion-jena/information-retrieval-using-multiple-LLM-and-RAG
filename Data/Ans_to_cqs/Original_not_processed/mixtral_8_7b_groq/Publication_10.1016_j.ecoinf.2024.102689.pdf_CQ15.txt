Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in the study referred to utilizes the Adam optimizer for optimization. The Adam optimizer is a method that combines the advantages of two other optimization methods, AdaGrad and RMSProp. It is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that can adjust the learning rate for each parameter individually based on the estimated first and second moments of the gradient. This makes it suitable for problems with sparse gradients, like those found in natural language processing and computer vision. Additionally, the pipeline uses a learning rate decay strategy, with an initial learning rate of 0.001, which decreases to a minimum learning rate of 0.0001 during training. The training process spans 300 epochs, and the batch size is set to 16. The model is implemented using Python 3.6, PyTorch version 1.8.0, and the CUDA version 11.4 on a GPU. The virtual environment function of Anaconda3 is utilized in the process.
