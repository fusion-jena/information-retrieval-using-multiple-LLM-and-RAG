The provided context does not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. The study focuses on the development of a deep learning framework for highway air quality monitoring and prediction, but it does not mention any of the commonly used datasets in deep learning such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

The study mentions that the framework is implemented using the REVIS system, but it does not provide details about the data used for training and testing the deep learning models. The authors mention that the system is used for collecting data, and that big data tools are used for data storage, but the specific datasets are not identified.

Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
