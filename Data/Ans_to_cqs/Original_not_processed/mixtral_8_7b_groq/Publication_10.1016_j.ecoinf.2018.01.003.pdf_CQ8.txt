Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about a specific code repository for a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the history and applications of deep learning, as well as other topics such as Bayesian learning machines, artificial neural networks (ANN), and support vector machines (SVM). However, it does not mention any code repositories for these methods.

The context does mention the use of Matlab for a specific experiment predicting the ecological footprint (EF) of Beijing using an ANN model. However, this does not provide a code repository for a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as there is no information available in the provided context.
