The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, as described in the given context, is not explicitly detailed. However, based on the information provided, we can infer some steps that might have been taken.

Answer: The deep learning model used in this study appears to be a combination of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which was pre-trained using the "ERNIE" model. This model was then used for sentiment analysis in a comparative analysis with other models like Rostcm 6.0, Simple Bayesian Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks.

For the image data, the HRNet model was used for semantic segmentation. This model was chosen for its high accuracy and stability, and it was used to derive the greenness, blueness, and sky openness index of social media image data.

The first step in deploying such a model would typically be model serialization, where the trained model is saved in a format that can be loaded later. This allows the model to be used in different environments and platforms without having to retrain it every time.

The next step would be platform selection. The context does not specify which platform was used for deployment. However, given that the image processing involved semantic segmentation and the use of graphics processing software for proofreading, it can be inferred that a platform with strong computational capabilities was used.

After deployment, the model would need to be integrated with the data processing pipeline. For the text data, this involved using an NLP model based on the LSTM-CNN framework for sentiment scoring. For the image data, the HRNet model was used for semantic segmentation, and the resulting data was processed using Matlab for quantitative methods.

In conclusion, while the exact process followed for deploying the model is not provided, it can be inferred that the process involved model serialization, platform selection, and integration with the data processing pipeline.
