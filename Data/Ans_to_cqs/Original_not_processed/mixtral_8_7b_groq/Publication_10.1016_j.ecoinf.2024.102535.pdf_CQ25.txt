Answer:::
The deep learning models mentioned in the given context are used for the problem of deep-sea substratum characterization. This implies that these models are primarily employed for classification tasks.

The models are used to identify and categorize different types of seabed features or substrata based on optical imagery. This is crucial for understanding the marine environment, biodiversity, and ecosystem management. 

The models are evaluated on both single and multi-label classification problems. In a single-label classification, each image is assigned to one class, while in a multi-label classification, an image can be assigned to multiple classes. 

The models are tested on three different sites, and their performance is assessed in both single-site and cross-site scenarios. The single-site scenario involves training and testing the models on data from the same site, while the cross-site scenario involves training the models on data from one site and testing them on data from another site. This is done to evaluate the generalization capacity of the models.

The deep learning models are based on six state-of-the-art architectures, one of which is a variant of the VGG network. This particular VGG-inspired architecture has 14 layers (13 convolutional and one dense layer) and has been modified mainly in the block of fully connected layers for the specific task of deep-sea substratum characterization. 

Therefore, the deep learning models are primarily used for classification tasks in the context of deep-sea substratum characterization.
