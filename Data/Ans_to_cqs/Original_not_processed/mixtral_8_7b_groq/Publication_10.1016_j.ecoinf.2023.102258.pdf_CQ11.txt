Answer:::
Unfortunately, there is no specific link to a data repository provided in the given context for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context focuses more on the methods, techniques, and systems used in the public challenge, such as the use of baselines, prototypical approaches, Mel +PCEN, template matching, and various systems submitted by different authors. It also discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), cross-entropy loss (x-ent), and other loss functions like SCL and Dist:Proto.

However, it's important to note that the study involves several systems and methods, and it's not clear which specific data repository would be associated with the deep learning pipeline. It's possible that the data used in the study were obtained from various sources and not hosted in a single, public repository.

In cases where data are not publicly available or no link is provided, it's recommended to contact the authors of the study or the organizers of the public challenge for more information. They may be able to provide access to the data or guide you to the appropriate sources.
