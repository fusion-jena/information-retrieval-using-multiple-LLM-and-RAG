Answer:::
I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of ResNet, ViT, and CA-Hybrid network for Cervidae classification, as well as the use of YOLOv7 for object localization. However, it does not mention or provide a link to any data repository.
