Based on the provided context, there is no information about deploying a deep learning model. The text focuses on the evaluation of input data using the Lazy Predict algorithm and the Python library, which includes various machine learning models, but not deep learning models. Moreover, the specific models mentioned in the context are not deep learning models, but rather gradient boosting models such as Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) and Gradient Boosting (GB).

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer regarding the deployment of a deep learning model as it is not covered in the given context.
