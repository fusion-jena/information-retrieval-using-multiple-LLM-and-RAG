The provided context does not directly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of deep learning in image processing and ecological classification, which can provide some insight into potential data sources.

In the context of image processing for object detection, such as the apple detection method based on the des-YOLO v4 algorithm (Chen et al., 2021), the raw data would likely come from image sensors. These sensors could include cameras mounted on vehicles or drones for large-scale image acquisition. Additionally, public datasets of images, such as those available for the COCO object detection challenge (Lin et al., 2014), could also serve as raw data sources for training object detection models.

For ecological classification, raw data might come from various sources such as sensors, surveys, or existing datasets. Capinha et al. (2021) discuss the use of deep learning for supervised classification of temporal data in ecology, implying that time-series data from sensors or surveys could be used as inputs for deep learning models. Public datasets related to ecological monitoring or species distribution, such as those available through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), could also provide raw data for ecological deep learning applications.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines, it suggests that image sensors, time-series sensors or surveys, and public datasets could serve as potential sources for raw data in image processing and ecological classification applications.
