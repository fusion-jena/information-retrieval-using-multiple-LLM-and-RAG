The context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other methods for hyperparameter tuning. The text does mention that introducing a hybrid model of CNN and LSTM enhances the processing power of the model and improves its prediction accuracy, but it does not specify how the hyperparameters were determined or optimized. It is possible that the hyperparameters were optimized using a method not mentioned in the provided context, or they may have been set based on previous research or expert knowledge. Without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to this query.
