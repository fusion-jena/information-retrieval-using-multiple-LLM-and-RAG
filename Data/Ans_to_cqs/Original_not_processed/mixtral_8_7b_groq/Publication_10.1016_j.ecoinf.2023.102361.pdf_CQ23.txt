Answer:::

The research study describes measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, but it does not explicitly mention cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it does describe diverse dataset and splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.

To ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the study divided the dataset into three parts: training, validation, and testing. Sixty percent of the data was used for training the deep learning models, 20% was kept for validating the models, and the remaining 20% data was used for evaluating the performance of the models. This splitting of the dataset allowed for the model to be trained and validated on different data, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Additionally, the study used a diverse dataset for training and testing the model. The dataset was created by dividing images into patches, and these patches were used for predicting the class label of the image. The patches were then used to select important patches, and the model predicted the class label for each patch. The weighted majority voting technique was used to predict the class label of the image from the predicted labels. This approach of dividing images into patches and using the weighted majority voting technique allowed for the model to be trained and tested on a diverse set of image data, further improving its ability to generalize to new data.

In summary, the study ensured the generalizability of the deep learning model by splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, and by using a diverse dataset for training and testing the model.
