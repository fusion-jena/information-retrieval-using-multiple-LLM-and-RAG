The provided context does not contain information about deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines, including the use of random seed values.

In general, deep learning pipelines often involve randomness in various stages, such as data preprocessing, weight initialization, and dropout regularization. Strategies to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines include:

1. Fixed random seed values: To ensure reproducibility, a fixed random seed value can be set for various random processes in the pipeline, such as random sampling, shuffling, and initialization. This ensures that the same random events are generated each time the pipeline is executed.

2. Multiple runs with different random seeds: Running the pipeline multiple times with different random seeds can help assess the robustness and generalizability of the model. By observing the performance and output of the model across different runs, one can gain insights into the variability and consistency of the model's behavior.

3. Ensemble methods: Combining the outputs of multiple models trained with different random seeds can improve the overall performance and robustness of the deep learning pipeline. Ensemble methods, such as bagging, boosting, and stacking, can help reduce the impact of randomness and improve the generalizability of the model.

4. Regularization techniques: Techniques like dropout, weight decay, and early stopping can help mitigate the impact of randomness in deep learning pipelines. These methods help prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the model by introducing constraints and penalties on the model's complexity and capacity.

5. Data augmentation: Generating additional training data through transformations, such as rotation, scaling, and cropping, can help improve the model's robustness to randomness and variations in the input data. Data augmentation can also help reduce overfitting and improve the generalization of the model.

While the provided context does not discuss these strategies explicitly, they are common practices in deep learning pipelines to handle randomness and improve model performance.
