The provided text discusses a study on automatic annotation of coral reefs using deep learning, but it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that they used expert-annotated data for training and testing their model.

In the context of computer vision and machine learning based techniques for annotating marine images, there are several common data annotation techniques used in deep learning:

1. Image-level annotation: This is the simplest form of annotation where each image is labeled with a single class. For instance, an image of a coral reef might be labeled as 'coral reef'. This type of annotation is useful for image classification tasks.

2. Bounding box annotation: In this technique, a bounding box is drawn around the object of interest in an image. Each bounding box is labeled with the class of the object it contains. For example, a rectangular box can be drawn around a specific marine organism in an image and then labeled accordingly. This type of annotation is useful for object detection tasks.

3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves labeling each pixel in an image with the class of the object it belongs to. It provides a pixel-wise classification of the image. For instance, an image of a coral reef can be segmented into different classes such as 'coral', 'sand', 'fish', etc. This type of annotation is useful for image segmentation tasks.

4. Instance segmentation: This is a more advanced form of semantic segmentation where each instance of an object is segmented and labeled individually. For example, multiple instances of the same marine organism in an image can be segmented and labeled separately. This type of annotation is useful for instance-level recognition and counting tasks.

Based on the context, it can be inferred that the authors used a combination of image-level annotation and bounding box annotation for their study. They mentioned using the Benthoz15 dataset, which consists of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. Since the dataset is used for training and testing a deep learning model for image classification, it can be assumed that the annotations are at the image level. Additionally, the authors mentioned the potential of computer vision and machine learning based techniques for automating the annotation of marine images, which suggests the use of bounding box annotation or instance segmentation for automating the annotation process.

In summary, while the provided text does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that they used a combination of image-level annotation and bounding box annotation. Other data annotation techniques such as semantic segmentation and instance segmentation are also commonly used in deep learning for computer vision tasks and could potentially be used for annotating marine images.
