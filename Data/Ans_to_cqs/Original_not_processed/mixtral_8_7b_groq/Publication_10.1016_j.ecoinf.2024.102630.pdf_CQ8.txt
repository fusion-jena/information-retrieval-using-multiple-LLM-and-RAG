Answer:::
The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The paper "Ecological Informatics81(2024)10263015. Li et al." discusses the data and processing methods used in the study, but it does not mention where the code repository is located. The CRediT authorship contribution statement lists the authors' contributions, but it does not include information about the code repository. The declaration of generative AI and AI-assisted technologies in the writing process and the declaration of competing interest also do not mention the code repository.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study is not available.
