Answer:

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context focuses on the details of the data collection and imaging process for a biological study, and it does not include any information about the model training or evaluation process.

However, it is generally considered a best practice to monitor the performance of machine learning models during training using techniques such as validation curves, learning curves, and cross-validation. These methods can help to ensure that the model is not overfitting or underfitting the training data, and can provide insights into the optimal hyperparameters for the model.

Validation curves can be used to visualize the performance of the model on the training and validation sets at different points during training. Learning curves can be used to assess the relationship between the size of the training set and the performance of the model. Cross-validation involves dividing the data into multiple folds, training the model on one fold and evaluating it on the remaining folds, and repeating this process for each fold.

In addition, it is important to monitor the training process for convergence, to ensure that the model is not continuing to improve on the training data at the expense of generalization to new data. This can be done by tracking metrics such as the training and validation loss, accuracy, and other relevant performance metrics over time.

Overall, while the provided context does not include specific information about the strategy for monitoring model performance during training, it is likely that best practices such as validation curves, learning curves, cross-validation, and convergence monitoring were employed.
