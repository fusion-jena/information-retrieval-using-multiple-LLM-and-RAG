Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about which specific deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used to build the model. The text focuses on the use of UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) for species distribution modeling and the comparison of this method with tSNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) in the context of a deep learning model. However, it does not mention any specific deep learning frameworks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question without additional information.
