The provided context does not directly discuss data bias techniques in the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of redescription mining, a method that identifies local models on subsets of data and generates explicit and interpretable limiting conditions.

Redescription mining combines partitioning techniques, such as clustering, and modeling techniques, such as regression. This method is tailored for biogeographic analyses and aims to capture local patterns by requiring that at least 1% of localities satisfy both queries (MinSuppIn) and that at least 30% of localities satisfy neither of the queries (MinSuppOut).

In the context of data bias, techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, and undersampling can be used during the preprocessing stage to address data imbalance. However, these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

Stratified sampling involves dividing the population into homogeneous subgroups (or strata) and then selecting a sample from each subgroup. This technique ensures that each subgroup is proportionally represented in the sample, reducing data bias.

Oversampling is a technique used to increase the number of instances of the minority class in the dataset. This technique can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the number of instances of the majority class in the dataset. This technique can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from a variety of sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population. This technique can help prevent data bias by ensuring that the dataset includes instances from all relevant subgroups.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss data bias techniques in the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of redescription mining for biogeographic analyses. Techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be used during the preprocessing stage to address data imbalance and prevent data bias.
