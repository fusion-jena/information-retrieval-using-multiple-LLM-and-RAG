The provided text discusses the use of deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for ecoacoustic assessment. However, it does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

The text does mention that the dataset used for training the CNNs was randomly selected from the remaining sites. While random selection can help to ensure that the training data is representative, it does not directly address issues of data bias.

Other techniques that could be used to address data bias include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain characteristics, such as class labels, and then randomly selecting a specified proportion of samples from each subgroup for training and testing. Oversampling involves increasing the number of samples from underrepresented classes, while undersampling involves reducing the number of samples from overrepresented classes. Diverse data collection involves making a concerted effort to collect data from a wide range of sources and contexts to ensure that the data is representative of the population of interest.

Without more information about the specific dataset and the demographics of the sites from which it was collected, it is difficult to say for sure whether any of these techniques were used to address data bias. However, the authors do mention the importance of large quantities of training data for deep learning models, which suggests that they may have taken steps to ensure that their dataset was diverse and representative.
