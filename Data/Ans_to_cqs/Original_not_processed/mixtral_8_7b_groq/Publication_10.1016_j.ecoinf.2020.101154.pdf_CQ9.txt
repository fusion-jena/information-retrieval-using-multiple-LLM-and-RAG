Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the methodology and implementation of Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT) for identifying potential drivers of changes in growth across two herring populations. It explains the manual and grid search hyperparameter tuning process, the early stopping technique, and the most influential variables from the GBRT models. However, there is no mention of the data repository or where the data used in this study can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
