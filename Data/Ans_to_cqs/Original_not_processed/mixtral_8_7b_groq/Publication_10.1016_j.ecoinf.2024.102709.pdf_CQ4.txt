Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling being applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the description of the dataset used, the preprocessing of the images, and the models used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query. However, it is important to note that data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the size and diversity of the training set, which can help improve the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
