Answer: The context provided does not give information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It mainly focuses on the description of the ESK model, its development, and its application in fish classification using DNA barcode sequences. The model's components, such as Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), are discussed in detail, but there is no mention of the cloud platform where the model was deployed.
