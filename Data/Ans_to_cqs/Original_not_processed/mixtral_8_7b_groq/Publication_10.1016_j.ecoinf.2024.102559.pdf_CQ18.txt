Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, we can infer that the performance of the models is evaluated using various accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix.

The context includes two tables (A.5 and A.6) that report the accuracy metrics for models using different feature sets and window sizes. These accuracy metrics include Overall Accuracy, Producer's Accuracy, User's Accuracy, counts per class (n), and window size (pixels). The Producer's Accuracy, also known as the precision, measures the proportion of true positives among the predicted positives. The User's Accuracy, also known as the recall, measures the proportion of correctly predicted positives among the actual positives. The Overall Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances among all instances. The confusion matrix, presented in Table A.8, reports the number of false positives (FP), false negatives (FN), true positives (TP), and true negatives (TN) for the assessment sample classification.

Moreover, the context mentions the use of the scikit-learn library, which provides various tools for monitoring and evaluating model performance during training. For instance, the library includes functions for calculating accuracy metrics, visualizing confusion matrices, and plotting learning curves.

Therefore, while the specific strategy for monitoring the model performance during training is not provided, it is clear that the model performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix, and possibly with the help of tools from the scikit-learn library.
