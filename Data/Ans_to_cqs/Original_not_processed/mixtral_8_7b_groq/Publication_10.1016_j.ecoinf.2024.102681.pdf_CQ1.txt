Answer:

The provided context does not offer explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the study utilizes a comprehensive dataset that includes various influencing factors and a extensive drought propagation time series. This dataset spans from January 1950 to December 2020. Therefore, it can be deduced that the data could have been obtained from sources such as public datasets, sensors, or satellite imagery. Further research or access to the original study would be required to definitively answer this question.
