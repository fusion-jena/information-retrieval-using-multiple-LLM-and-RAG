Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps applied after the model training. However, it can be inferred that some evaluation metrics were calculated since the training was performed to reach a high classification accuracy on labeled biocrust images.

The loss function used in the training process, as shown in equation (18), includes a term for the classification accuracy of the model output y1 and the target values Å·1. This suggests that classification accuracy was one of the metrics of interest.

Furthermore, the training process involved cross-validation, where the model was trained on 80% of the training data and validated on the remaining 20%. This step also implies that some sort of performance evaluation was carried out during the training process.

However, there is no mention of other postprocessing steps such as generating saliency maps or creating confusion matrices. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer regarding the specific postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
