Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the strategy implemented to monitor model performance during training. However, it does discuss the use of data filtering and temporal and spatial scaling in the context of environmental data and ecological processes. It is possible that model performance is being monitored using techniques such as cross-validation or by comparing model predictions to observed data at various stages of training. Additionally, it is also possible that the authors have used some sort of performance metric such as accuracy, precision, recall or F1 score to monitor the model performance during the training. However, without further information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.

It is also worth noting that the references provided in the context discuss the use of remote sensing data and satellite imagery for monitoring grasslands and other ecological systems. These methods often involve training machine learning models on large datasets, so it is likely that the authors have implemented some sort of strategy for monitoring model performance during training.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the strategy used to monitor model performance during training, it is possible that the authors have used techniques such as cross-validation, performance metrics, or comparison to observed data to do so. Additionally, the references provided suggest that the authors are likely working with large datasets and machine learning models, which would typically involve some form of model performance monitoring.
