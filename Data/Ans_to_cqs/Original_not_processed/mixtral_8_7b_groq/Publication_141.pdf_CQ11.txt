Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on the factors that influenced the choice of network architecture and image acquisition protocol, as well as the process and techniques used for training the CNN model. However, it does not mention or provide a link to the data repository where the pipeline or the dataset used in the study can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
