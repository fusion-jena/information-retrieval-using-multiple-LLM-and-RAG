Answer:::

The optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, as described in the given context, include Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM) and Bayesian optimization.

The SGDM optimizer was used to train the models for a maximum of 10 epochs. The SGDM optimizer is an extension of the standard Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer, which incorporates the momentum term to improve the convergence of the optimization process. The momentum term takes into account the past gradients' direction to smooth the optimization path, which can be particularly helpful in deep learning models with many parameters.

On the other hand, Bayesian optimization was employed to find the optimal hyperparameters' values for each of the six models. Bayesian optimization is a powerful optimization technique that can handle complex optimization problems with many variables. In this study, the optimization was performed by minimizing the loss on the validation dataset, and the variables optimized were the batch size and the initial learning rate.

It is worth noting that the given context does not mention other popular optimization techniques such as Adam or RMSprop. Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) is another optimization algorithm that adaptively adjusts the learning rate based on the past gradients' direction and magnitude. RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation) is another optimization algorithm that also adaptively adjusts the learning rate based on the past gradients' magnitude.

Therefore, while the given context mentions the use of SGDM and Bayesian optimization, it does not explicitly mention the use of Adam or RMSprop. However, it is possible that the authors used these optimization algorithms during the pre-training phase with ImageNet weights, but they did not mention it in the given context.
