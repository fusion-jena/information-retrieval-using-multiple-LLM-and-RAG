Answer:::

I am unable to provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline as none of the provided sources mention or contain information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. The sources mainly discuss topics related to remote sensing, forest carbon pools, and aboveground biomass estimation using various methods and data sources. If you have additional information that could help locate the desired code repository, please provide it and I will do my best to answer your query.
