Answer:::

The regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline include dropout and, although not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, likely also L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization technique that was introduced by Srivastava et al. (2014). It works by randomly removing a proportion of nodes during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of feature detectors. In the context of the DeepMeerkat project, dropout could be applied in the fine-tuned neural network layers to prevent overfitting on the collected images.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is another common regularization technique that was not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. It works by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages large weights and promotes the spread of weight values. This helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model.

In addition to these regularization techniques, other methods such as data augmentation, early stopping, and batch normalization can also be used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Data augmentation involves creating new training examples by applying random transformations to the existing data, which can help to increase the size and diversity of the training set. Early stopping involves monitoring the performance of the model on a validation set during training and stopping the training process when the performance starts to degrade. Batch normalization involves normalizing the inputs to each layer of the network, which can help to reduce internal covariate shift and improve the stability and speed of training.

Overall, the choice of regularization methods and other techniques to prevent overfitting depends on the specific deep learning pipeline and the characteristics of the data. A combination of methods is often used to achieve the best performance and prevent overfitting.
