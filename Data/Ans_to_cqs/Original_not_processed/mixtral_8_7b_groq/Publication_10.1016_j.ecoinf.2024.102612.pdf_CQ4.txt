The provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does highlight the importance of data augmentation in training DNN models for semantic classification of LiDAR point clouds, using synthetic data from an external simulator.

Common data augmentation techniques for images include flipping, rotating, and scaling. These techniques can be applied to LiDAR point clouds as well, but they would involve transforming the 3D coordinates of the points instead of 2D pixel coordinates. For example, point clouds can be rotated around any axis, flipped along any plane, or scaled by changing the distances between points. Other possible augmentations for point clouds include adding noise, removing points, or adding new points.

In the context provided, the authors used data augmentation to address the need for large training datasets in DNNs. They focused on simulating aerial and terrestrial LiDAR point clouds, including ALS, Terrestrial, and Mobile Laser Scanning (TLS and MLS) point clouds. These simulations were used to pretrain a DL model for semantic classification of real LiDAR point clouds. After training, the model was tested on real MS point clouds, and the inferences were used as inputs for a decision tree scheme to retrieve the final fuel models.

While the specific data augmentation techniques are not mentioned, the authors emphasize the importance of integrating augmented data simulations during the training phase of DL models for semantic classification of LiDAR point clouds.
