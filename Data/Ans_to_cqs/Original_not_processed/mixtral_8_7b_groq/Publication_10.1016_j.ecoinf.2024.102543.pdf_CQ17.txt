Although the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it does discuss the use of a validation set during training. This approach can be considered an implicit form of regularization, as it helps prevent overfitting by fine-tuning hyperparameters and assessing the model's performance on unseen data.

In addition to using a validation set, there are several common regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines:

1. L1 and L2 Regularization: These techniques add a penalty term to the loss function, which encourages the model to have smaller weights. L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds the absolute value of the weights as a penalty, while L2 regularization, or weight decay, adds the square of the weights.

2. Dropout: This method randomly sets a fraction of the neurons in a layer to zero during training. This helps prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons and promoting the learning of more robust features.

3. Early Stopping: This technique involves monitoring the model's performance on the validation set during training. If the performance on the validation set starts to degrade, even if the training loss continues to decrease, the training process is stopped early.

4. Data Augmentation: Although mentioned in the context primarily for diversifying the dataset, data augmentation can also act as a form of regularization. By creating new training examples through transformations like rotation, scaling, or flipping, the model is forced to learn more general features that are invariant to these transformations.

5. Batch Normalization: This technique normalizes the activations of each layer, reducing internal covariate shift and promoting faster and more stable training. It can also act as a regularizer by introducing noise during training.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these regularization techniques, it is possible that some or all of them were employed in the deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting.
