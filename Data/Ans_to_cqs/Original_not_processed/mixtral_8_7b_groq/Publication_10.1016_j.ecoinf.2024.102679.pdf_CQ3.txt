Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning (DL) in aerial surveys for wildlife population estimation, specifically in the context of African savanna. However, it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the DL pipeline.

However, based on general practices in the field of deep learning, particularly for object detection and image segmentation tasks, we can make some educated guesses about the data annotation techniques that might have been used in this study.

For object detection tasks, such as detecting animals in aerial imagery, bounding box annotation is a common technique. This involves drawing a bounding box around each instance of the object of interest in the image, providing the x and y coordinates of the box's top-left corner and its width and height. This annotated data is then used to train the DL model to detect and classify objects within images.

For more fine-grained analysis, such as instance segmentation, where the goal is to identify and segment each instance of the object of interest in the image, more advanced annotation techniques are required. These might include pixel-level annotation, where each pixel in the image is labeled according to the object it belongs to, or polygon annotation, where a polygon is drawn around each instance of the object.

It's possible that a combination of these annotation techniques was used in the DL pipeline for this study, depending on the specific objectives and requirements of the analysis. However, without access to the full study or additional information, this is only speculation.
