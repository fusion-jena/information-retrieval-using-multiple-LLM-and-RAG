Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This was determined by the mention of a "CNN Model 4" and a confusion matrix generated for this model in Figure 7 (b). Additionally, it was stated that the proposed model was designed based on the VGG architecture, which is a well-known CNN architecture. The specific VGG architecture used in this pipeline is VGG16, which was chosen due to its performance on the ImageNet dataset. However, the CNN model used in this pipeline contains only 12 layers, unlike the conventional VGG16 or VGG19 models which have 16 and 19 layers respectively.
