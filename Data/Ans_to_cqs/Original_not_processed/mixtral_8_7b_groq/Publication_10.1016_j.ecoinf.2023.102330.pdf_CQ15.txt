Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for processing acoustic data. However, it is mentioned that a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used for covey call detection. In general, CNNs are trained using optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or RMSprop.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters by taking a step in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters. SGD is widely used for training neural networks, but it can be slow to converge and may get stuck in local minima.

Adam is a more sophisticated optimization algorithm that combines the ideas of SGD with momentum and adaptive learning rates. Adam estimates the first and second moments of the gradient and uses them to adapt the learning rate for each parameter. Adam has been shown to perform well on a wide range of optimization problems and is often used as the default optimization algorithm for training deep learning models.

RMSprop is another optimization algorithm that is similar to Adam but uses a different approach for adaptive learning rates. RMSprop maintains a moving average of the squared gradients and uses it to scale the learning rate for each parameter. RMSprop is often used for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and has been shown to perform well on optimization problems with non-stationary gradients.

Without more information about the specific deep learning pipeline used in the study, it is difficult to say which optimization algorithm was used. However, based on the widespread use of CNNs in deep learning, it is likely that one of the optimization algorithms mentioned above was used for training the CNN.
