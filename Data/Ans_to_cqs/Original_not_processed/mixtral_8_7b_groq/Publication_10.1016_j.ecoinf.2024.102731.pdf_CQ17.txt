Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about deep learning pipelines, dropout, or L2 regularization. These are concepts related to machine learning and statistical modeling. The sources provided focus on urban areas, vegetation, wild rabbit conservation, and habitat factors.

Answer:::

In summary, the context provided does not contain the information required to answer the query. However, I can provide a brief explanation of the regularization methods mentioned in the query:

1. Dropout: A regularization technique used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction rate of input units to 0, which helps in preventing over-dependence on any one neuron and thus improving the model's generalization ability.

2. L2 regularization: Also known as weight decay, L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the sum of squares of the model's weights. This encourages smaller weights, reducing the complexity of the model and helping to prevent overfitting.
