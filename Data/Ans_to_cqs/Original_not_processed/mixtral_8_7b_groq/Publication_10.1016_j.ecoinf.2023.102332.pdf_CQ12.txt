Answer:::
The specific type of deep learning model used in the given context is a Transformer. The 2018 paper by Devlin, Chang, Lee, and Toutanova introduces BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a pre-training approach for deep bidirectional transformers. This model has been widely adopted for various natural language processing tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional recurrent and convolutional neural networks.

The BERT model utilizes a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer architecture, which allows the model to learn contextual relations between words in a text by considering the entire sequence simultaneously. This is achieved through the use of self-attention mechanisms, enabling the model to weigh the importance of words in the sequence when generating a representation for a given word.

In contrast to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Transformers do not rely on sequential processing or convolutional filters. Instead, they leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies and word context, making them particularly suitable for natural language understanding tasks.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of BERT or Transformers in the described pipelines, the reference to pre-training deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding indicates that a Transformer-based model like BERT is likely being employed.

In summary, the deep learning model used in the given context is a Transformer, specifically the BERT model, which has been widely adopted for natural language processing tasks due to its ability to effectively capture contextual relationships between words.
