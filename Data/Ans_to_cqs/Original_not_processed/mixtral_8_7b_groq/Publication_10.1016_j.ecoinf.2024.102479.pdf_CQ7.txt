The text provided does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. However, it does mention that for all the models tested, including the deep learning model, the dataset was split into two distinct sets: 70% of the dataset was designated for model training while the remaining 30% was used as a testing dataset. This approach ensured that the models were trained on a sufficient amount of data while also providing an independent dataset for testing.

In addition, the text mentions that hyperparameters of the deep learning model, specifically the artificial neural network, were optimized through a grid search approach involving cross-validation. This method was used to minimize errors and achieve the best possible performance. However, the specific criteria used for splitting the data during cross-validation are not provided.

Therefore, while the text provides some information about the dataset split for model training and testing, it does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as the train, test, and validation splits.
