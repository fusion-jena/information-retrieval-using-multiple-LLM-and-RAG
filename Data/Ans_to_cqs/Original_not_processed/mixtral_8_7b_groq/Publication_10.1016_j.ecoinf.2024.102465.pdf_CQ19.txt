Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific deep learning framework used in the study. However, it does mention that the HRNet model is used for semantic segmentation of social media image data in PyCharm software. HRNet is a model developed by Sun et al. (2019) and is implemented in various deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.

Ma (2023) mentions using PyTorch for implementing the LSTM-CNN model for NLP text data sentiment scoring. Although this model is used for processing text data and not image data, it suggests that the researchers may be using PyTorch as their deep learning framework.

Therefore, while the exact deep learning framework is not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the study may be using PyTorch as the deep learning framework based on the available context.
