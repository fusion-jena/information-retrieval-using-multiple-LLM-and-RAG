Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the specific deep learning model, its architecture, or the hyperparameters used in the model. The text discusses the importance of collecting big data on valve gaping, temperature, and chlorophyll for improving predictions on productivity in aquaculture. It also mentions a few studies (Guarini et al., 2021; Ciavatta et al., 2008) that focus on estimating phytoplanktonic production and system respiration using data collected by monitoring networks. However, these studies do not involve deep learning models or specify any hyperparameters.

In general, hyperparameters in deep learning models can include learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons per layer, activation functions, regularization techniques, batch size, and the number of epochs. The choice of these hyperparameters depends on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture. Tuning these hyperparameters is crucial for achieving good model performance.

Since the provided context does not contain information about the deep learning model or its hyperparameters, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to this query.
