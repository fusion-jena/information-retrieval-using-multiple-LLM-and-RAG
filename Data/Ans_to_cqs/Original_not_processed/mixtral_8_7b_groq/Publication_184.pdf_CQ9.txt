Unfortunately, the provided context does not specify the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The pieces of context mention several studies and papers that use deep learning techniques for various applications such as hyperspectral image classification, fish tracking and counting, and IoT security. However, none of them explicitly mention where the data repository for their deep learning pipeline is available.

It is important to note that making the data repository available is a good practice in scientific research as it promotes transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration. Therefore, it is recommended that the authors of the aforementioned studies consider sharing their data repositories in their future works.

In summary, the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is not available in the provided context.
