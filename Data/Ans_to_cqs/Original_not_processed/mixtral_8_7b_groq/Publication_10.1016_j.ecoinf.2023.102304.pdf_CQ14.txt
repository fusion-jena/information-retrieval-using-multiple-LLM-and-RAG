Based on the provided context, the hyperparameters of the Land Trendr (LTR) algorithm for monitoring land cover changes are optimized through a process that involves selecting the most appropriate index for a given region and tuning the algorithm's parameters to the specific conditions of each region.

The LTR algorithm can provide more accurate results by selecting the most appropriate index for a given region, as different regions may have different climate and vegetation cover conditions. By optimizing the model proportion for best fitting, the LTR algorithm can capture the index response to wildfire more effectively.

The performance of the LTR algorithm can be significantly impacted by the way it is tuned to the specific conditions of each region. Therefore, parameter calibration is needed in LTR applications as it is a parameter-sensitive algorithm. Two parameters, Max Segments (MS) and Recovery Threshold (RT), are identified as especially critical for the algorithm's performance.

However, the context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters are optimized, such as through grid search, random search, or other optimization techniques. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query based on the provided context.

In summary, the hyperparameters of the LTR algorithm for monitoring land cover changes are optimized through a process that involves selecting the most appropriate index for a given region and tuning the algorithm's parameters to the specific conditions of each region. However, the context does not provide specific information on the optimization technique used for hyperparameter tuning.
