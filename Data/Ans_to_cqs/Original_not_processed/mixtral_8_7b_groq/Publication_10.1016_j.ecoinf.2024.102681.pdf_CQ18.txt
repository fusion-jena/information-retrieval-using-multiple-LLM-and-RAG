Answer:::
The text provided does not give explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that an iterative approach was used in the model training process, which implies that there might have been some form of monitoring to adjust the weights of the fully connected layers based on the evolving patterns in the weights associated with each specific influencing factor. Additionally, the model's prediction accuracy on the testing set improved after embedding LSTM into the CNN, suggesting some form of performance tracking. However, the specifics of the monitoring strategy remain undisclosed in the text.
