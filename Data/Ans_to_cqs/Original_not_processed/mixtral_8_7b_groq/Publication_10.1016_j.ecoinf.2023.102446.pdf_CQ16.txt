Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when the training of the rogates (surrogates) is complete. However, it does mention that 100 surrogates were used and a significance level of 1% was considered. It is common in machine learning and statistical models to use criteria such as validation loss plateau, convergence of model parameters, or achieving a certain level of accuracy or performance to determine when training is complete.

In the context of this study, the training of the surrogates could potentially be determined by the performance on a validation set or by the stability of the model parameters after a certain number of iterations. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.

Additionally, the study mentions a data gap from 02 August 2016 to 08 September 2016 due to instrument failure, which was represented by grey strips in Figure 2. The time series of NEE and VPD were analyzed, and it was observed that higher VPD reduces carbon uptake by plants, leading to lower carbon assimilation during the pre-monsoon summer seasons. This signature is consistent with existing knowledge about plants' sensitivity to VPD. However, this information is not directly related to the criteria used to determine when the training of the surrogates is complete.
