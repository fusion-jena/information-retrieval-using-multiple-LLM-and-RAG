Based on the provided context, there is no information about the deployment of a deep learning model. The text focuses on the development and application of ensemble habitat suitability models for ungulate populations using machine learning techniques such as GLM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, and MARS. It discusses the performance of these models, variable contributions to habitat suitability, and the measurement of core habitats and corridors.

However, the text does mention some steps related to model deployment in general machine learning projects. For instance, it talks about model serialization when mentioning the RF model as the best-performing one. Model serialization is the process of saving a trained model into a file, which can be used later for making predictions without needing to retrain the model. This is useful for deploying a model in a production environment.

Furthermore, the text mentions the use of UNICOR software for connectivity prediction, which might involve some platform selection and deployment decisions. However, the specifics of these decisions are not provided in the context.

Therefore, while the text does not explicitly describe the process followed to deploy a deep learning model, it does touch upon some related concepts such as model serialization and software selection.
