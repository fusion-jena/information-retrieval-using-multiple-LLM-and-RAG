Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the integration of peat depth information in GMEPBHmod, the comparison of LWHab map with EarthTrack habitat survey data, and accuracy assessments for Pembrokeshire County. However, there is no mention of the code repository or any deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested information.
