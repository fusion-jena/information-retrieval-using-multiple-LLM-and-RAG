Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. There is no mention of any specific repository where the data used in the pipeline is stored or can be accessed. The text focuses on describing the methodology and architecture of the deep learning model, but it does not provide information about data availability or sharing. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a data repository for this pipeline.
