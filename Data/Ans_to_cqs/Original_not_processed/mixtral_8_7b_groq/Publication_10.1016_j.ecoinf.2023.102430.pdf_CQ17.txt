Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline for the pre-trained convolutional neural network (AlexNet). However, it is mentioned that the AlexNet model was implemented in MATLAB and trained using stochastic gradient descent with momentum optimizer. While the context does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization, these techniques are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting.

Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out a proportion of neurons during training, preventing over-reliance on any single neuron and promoting the development of redundant representations across the network. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the model weights. This encourages smaller weight values, reducing the capacity of the model and helping to prevent overfitting.

Given that the authors left most hyperparameters at their default values and did not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization, it is possible that these techniques were not used in this particular implementation of AlexNet. However, it is also possible that they were used but not mentioned in the provided context. Without further information, it is not possible to definitively answer this question.
