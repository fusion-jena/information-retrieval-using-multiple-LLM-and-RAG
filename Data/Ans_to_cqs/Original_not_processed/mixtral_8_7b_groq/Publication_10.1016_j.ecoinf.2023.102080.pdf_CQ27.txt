Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the deployment of a trained deep learning model. The text focuses on comparing the computation time and model accuracy of three main covariate selection procedures (embedded, filter, and random) in ecological informatics. It discusses the computation time needed for running the overall covariate selection procedure and model fitting steps, as well as model fitting only, under each of the three procedures. Additionally, it mentions the use of Generalized Linear Model with elastic-net regularization (GLM-EN), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), and Random Forest (RF) as modeling algorithms. However, there is no information about the deployment of a deep learning model.
