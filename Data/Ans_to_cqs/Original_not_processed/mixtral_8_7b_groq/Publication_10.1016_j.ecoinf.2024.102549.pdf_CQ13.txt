Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model described in the context include the learning rate, optimizer, kernel size, stride, dropout rate, number of epochs, momentum, and the method for adjusting the learning rate.

The model uses a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) structure with five convolutional layers, one pooling layer, and three fully connected layers. The convolutional layers have a kernel size of 3 and a stride of 1. A dropout function was incorporated between the fully connected layers with a dropout rate of 50%.

The training of the model was conducted over 500 epochs with a momentum of 0.9. The learning rate was initially set to 10 and was halved every 20 rounds to optimize performance.

The optimizer used in the model is not explicitly mentioned in the context. However, it can be inferred that the optimizer used is likely to be a form of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based on the use of a learning rate and momentum.

In summary, the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model described in the context include:

* Learning rate: Initially set to 10 and halved every 20 rounds.
* Optimizer: Likely to be a form of stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
* Kernel size: 3.
* Stride: 1.
* Dropout rate: 50%.
* Number of epochs: 500.
* Momentum: 0.9.
* Learning rate adjustment method: Halved every 20 rounds.
