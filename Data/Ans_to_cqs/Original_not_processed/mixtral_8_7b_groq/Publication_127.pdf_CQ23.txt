Answer:::

The generalizability of a deep learning model refers to its ability to perform well on unseen data. From the provided context, it can be inferred that the authors took several measures to ensure the generalizability of their model.

Firstly, they used a diverse dataset to train their model. The dataset they used consisted of 25% (757,000) nonempty images, which were images that contained animals, and randomly selected 757,000 empty images, which were images that did not contain animals. This dataset was then split into training and test sets. Using a diverse dataset helps to ensure that the model is exposed to a wide variety of inputs, which can help to improve its ability to generalize to new data.

Secondly, the authors used an ensemble of models to improve the generalizability of their model. An ensemble of models is a set of multiple models that are trained separately and then combined in some way to make a final prediction. In this case, the authors trained multiple ResNet models with different numbers of layers (ResNet-18, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and ResNet-152) and then combined their predictions using a simple average. Ensemble methods can help to improve the generalizability of a model by reducing the variance of the predictions.

Finally, the authors used a Stratified splitting technique to split their dataset into training and test sets. Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures that the sample is representative of the population with respect to certain characteristics. In this case, the authors used Stratified sampling to ensure that the training and test sets had the same proportion of nonempty and empty images. This can help to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and is able to generalize to new data.

In summary, the authors took several measures to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning model, including using a diverse dataset, an ensemble of models, and Stratified sampling. These methods can help to improve the model's ability to perform well on unseen data.
