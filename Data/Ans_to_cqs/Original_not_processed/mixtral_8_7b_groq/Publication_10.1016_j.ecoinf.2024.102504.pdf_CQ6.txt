Answer:::

Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved, including normalization, scaling, and cleaning. These steps help to ensure the data is in a suitable format for the model to learn effectively.

Normalization is a common preprocessing step that involves scaling numeric data to a range of [0, 1] or mean = 0, standard deviation = 1. This is important as deep learning models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, can be sensitive to the scale of input features. In the context of air quality prediction, Navares and Aznarte (2020) used Min-Max scaling to normalize their dataset.

Cleaning the data is another crucial step, which may involve handling missing values, outliers, or irrelevant data. For instance, Gokul et al. (2023) filled missing values with the mean of the respective feature before training their LSTM model for PM2.5 prediction. 

In addition, feature engineering can be used to create new features from existing ones, which can help improve model performance. This could involve creating polynomial or interaction features, or using domain knowledge to derive meaningful features. For example, Pandey (2020) discussed the use of fly ash deposits as a potential sink for carbon sequestration, which could be a relevant feature for air quality models.

Furthermore, it is important to consider the temporal dependencies in the data, especially for time series forecasting tasks such as air quality prediction. This can be achieved by using techniques like lagged features or differencing. Chianese et al. (2019) used a multi-layer perceptron to predict ambient particulate matter concentration, taking into account the spatio-temporal dependencies in their dataset.

Lastly, it is important to split the data into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's performance and avoid overfitting. This allows for the model to be trained on one portion of the data, while the remaining portions are used to validate and test the model's performance.

In summary, preprocessing steps for deep learning models typically involve normalization, scaling, cleaning, feature engineering, handling temporal dependencies, and data splitting. These steps are crucial for ensuring the data is in a suitable format for the model to learn effectively, and can significantly impact the model's performance.
