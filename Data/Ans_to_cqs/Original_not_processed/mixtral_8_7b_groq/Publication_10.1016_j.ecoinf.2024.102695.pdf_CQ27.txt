Answer:::

The context provided does not include specific details about the deployment of the trained deep learning model. However, it does offer some insights that can help us infer possible steps that might have been taken.

The training process was conducted in a controlled environment using Windows 11, Python 3.8, and specific hardware including a 12th-Gen Intel Core i7-12700H GPU and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 GPU. This suggests that the model could have been deployed on a similar or compatible system.

The model was trained using a specific architecture, involving two layers of encoders and one layer of decoders, with a dimensionality of 128 and 8 attention heads. This architecture could have been saved or serialized during the training process, allowing for later deployment.

The model was trained using multivariate input and univariate output, with the input and output dimensions set to the number of variables in the dataset. This specific configuration might have been preserved during the serialization of the model, to ensure compatibility during deployment.

The model was trained using a batch size of 24 and a learning rate of 0.0001, over 300 epochs. The learning rate and the number of epochs could have been stored as part of the model's configuration, to be used during deployment.

The model was trained using an early stopping strategy, which could have been implemented using a validation set. The model's performance on the validation set could have been stored and used during deployment, to monitor the model's performance and to trigger early stopping if necessary.

In conclusion, while the context does not provide explicit details about the deployment of the trained deep learning model, it does suggest that the model could have been serialized, and that its architecture, configuration, and performance metrics could have been preserved for use during deployment. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
