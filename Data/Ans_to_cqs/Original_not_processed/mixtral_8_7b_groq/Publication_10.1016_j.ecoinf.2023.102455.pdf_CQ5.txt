Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It focuses mainly on the configuration and hyperparameters of the models used in the pipeline. Mentioned models include CNN-BiGRU, CNN-BiRNN, KELM, and RVFL, which are used to create a multi-temporal forecasting model of daily streamflow (Qflow).

However, the context does mention some parameters that are common in deep learning tasks, such as the number of filters, kernel size, optimizer, activation function, number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate. These parameters are used in conjunction with various models but do not provide insight into the specific datasets being used.

In general, when working with deep learning pipelines, popular datasets include:

1. MNIST: A dataset of handwritten digits, commonly used for image classification tasks.
2. CIFAR: A collection of image datasets used for object recognition and other computer vision tasks.
3. ImageNet: A large-scale dataset of images, often used for object detection, image classification, and other computer vision tasks.

It is possible that the deep learning pipeline described in the context uses one or more of these datasets, or it could be working with a different, domain-specific dataset related to streamflow or hydrology. To provide a definitive answer, more information about the dataset(s) used in the pipeline would be required.
