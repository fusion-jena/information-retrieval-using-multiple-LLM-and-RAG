Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific deep learning framework used to build the models. However, it is mentioned that machine learning and neural network-based models were used for the site data, coral cover, and connectivity, as well as convolutional neural networks (CNN) and generative adversarial networks (GAN).

Popular deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow and PyTorch. TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence developed by Google Brain Team. PyTorch is another open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, which was developed by Facebook's AI Research lab.

Considering the popularity and extensive capabilities of both TensorFlow and PyTorch, either of these deep learning frameworks could have been used to build the models. However, without explicit information in the context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.

Anonymous experts suggested that the models were likely built using TensorFlow or PyTorch, given their popularity and extensive capabilities for deep learning. However, further investigation would be required to confirm the specific deep learning framework used.
