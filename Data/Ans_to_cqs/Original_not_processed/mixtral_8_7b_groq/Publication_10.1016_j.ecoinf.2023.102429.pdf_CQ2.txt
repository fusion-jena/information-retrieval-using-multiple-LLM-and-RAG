Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of various methods for data pre-processing and analysis of soil nutrient concentrations.

The pre-processing of data was performed in ViewSpecPro and the Unscrambler, but the formats of the original data are not specified. It can be inferred that the data formats used could be compatible with these software tools, which may include CSV or other tabular data formats for spectral data.

In the analysis of soil nutrient concentration, Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) was used as the primary method. PLSR is a statistical method commonly used for analyzing spectral data, and it can handle data in various formats, including tabular data formats such as CSV.

Therefore, while the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned, it can be inferred that the data formats used are likely to be compatible with the pre-processing software and PLSR analysis method. These may include tabular data formats such as CSV, as well as other formats compatible with spectral data analysis.
