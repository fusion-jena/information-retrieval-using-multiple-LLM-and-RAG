Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model for species distribution modeling. However, it can be inferred that the data used for training the deep learning model has been processed and cleaned to some extent, as the study mentions the use of a set of manually validated recordings to evaluate the performance of the model.

In general, preprocessing steps for training deep learning models in bioacoustic studies can include data cleaning, normalization, and scaling. Data cleaning involves removing or correcting any errors or inconsistencies in the data, such as missing or incorrect labels. Normalization and scaling are used to adjust the range and distribution of the data to improve the performance of the model. Normalization involves scaling the data to a common range, such as between 0 and 1, while scaling involves adjusting the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

In the study by Benkendorf and Hawkins (2020), they analyzed the effect of sample size on deep neural networks for species distribution modeling. They mentioned increasing the number of hidden layers in the neural network, which can be interpreted as adding more training recordings in the software. However, they did not mention any specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning model.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give specific information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model for species distribution modeling, it can be inferred that some level of data cleaning, normalization, and scaling has been performed.
