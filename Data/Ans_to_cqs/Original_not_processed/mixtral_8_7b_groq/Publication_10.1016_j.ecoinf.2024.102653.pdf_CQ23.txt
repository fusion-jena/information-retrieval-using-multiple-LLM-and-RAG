Answer:::

The generalizability of the deep learning model was addressed through several measures, including the use of diverse datasets, partitioning the dataset into training and validation sets, and manual tuning of hyperparameters.

Firstly, the model was trained using varying disjoint subsets of the dataset, which corresponded to different time steps of flight activity recordings. These subsets included 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 days of recordings. Additionally, the model was trained with various combinations of datasets: 1, 2, 3, or all four datasets combined. This approach ensured that the model was exposed to a diverse range of data, thereby enhancing its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Secondly, the dataset was partitioned into training and validation sets, with 70% of the data designated for training and 30% for validation. This division was performed through random selection, which helped to minimize any potential bias in the selection of data points for training and validation.

Finally, meticulous manual tuning of hyperparameters was conducted to achieve optimal model performance. The selected hyperparameters, which yielded the best performance metrics, are presented in Table 1. These hyperparameters include the optimizer (ADAM), learning rate (0.003), batch size (32), epochs (100), dropout rate (0.5), and loss function (Binary Cross Entropy). The manual tuning of these hyperparameters helped to ensure that the model was not overfitting or underfitting the training data, which is crucial for the model's ability to generalize to new data.

However, it is important to note that while these measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the specific validation methodology used in this study did not involve cross-validation or stratified splitting. Cross-validation is a technique that involves partitioning the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on one fold, and validating it on another fold. This process is repeated for each fold, and the results are averaged to provide a more robust estimate of the model's performance. Stratified splitting, on the other hand, involves partitioning the dataset in a way that ensures that each subset (e.g., training and validation sets) has the same proportion of classes as the original dataset. This technique is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

Therefore, while the measures taken in this study helped to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the use of cross-validation or stratified splitting could have further enhanced the model's ability to generalize to new data.
