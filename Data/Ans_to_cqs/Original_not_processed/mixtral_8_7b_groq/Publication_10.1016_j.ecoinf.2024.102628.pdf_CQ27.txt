Answer:::

The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved model serialization and platform selection. Firstly, the model was trained and validated using the fast.ai platform, a popular deep learning library that provides high-level components for training neural nets. Specifically, the researchers utilized the pre-trained ResNet-34 architecture, which is a variant of the ResNet (Residual Network) family, widely used for deep learning tasks, particularly in computer vision. ResNet-34 was used inside the fast.ai framework to leverage existing knowledge, particularly useful in their dataset, given its small size.

After training the model, the next step was to serialize it, i.e., save the model's architecture, parameters, and optimizer's state. Model serialization allows the model to be stored and reloaded later, without requiring retraining. In Python, this can be achieved using the `save` method provided by PyTorch, the deep learning library underlying fast.ai. The serialized model can then be deployed on a platform suitable for serving machine learning models, such as a web server or a cloud-based machine learning platform.

However, the context does not provide specific details about the platform used for deploying the serialized model. It is possible that the researchers deployed the model on a local server or a cloud-based platform, depending on their requirements and resources.

In summary, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved training and validating the model using the fast.ai platform and the ResNet-34 architecture, serializing the model using PyTorch's `save` method, and deploying the serialized model on a suitable platform.
