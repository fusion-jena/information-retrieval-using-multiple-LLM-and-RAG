Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the provided context are ImageNet and Benthoz15. ImageNet is a large-scale hierarchical image database used for training the deep neural networks, while Benthoz15 is a dataset consisting of expert-annotated and geo-referenced marine images from Australian seas. The deep neural networks are first trained on ImageNet and then fine-tuned on the Benthoz15 dataset for the specific task of coral classification. Therefore, these two datasets are used in the deep learning pipeline.
