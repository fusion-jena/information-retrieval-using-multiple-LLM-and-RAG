Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes the training parameters used in DeepLabV3+, details about the Vasiliko site data used for training, performance metrics using different quadrants of the Vasiliko dataset for sequential training, and NDVI-ML results. However, there is no information about the data repository link. I hope this helps.
