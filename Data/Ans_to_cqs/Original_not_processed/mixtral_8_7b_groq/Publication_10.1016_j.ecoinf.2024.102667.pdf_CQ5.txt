Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the described studies are not related to the MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet datasets commonly used in deep learning research. Instead, these studies utilize various datasets related to meteorological observations, land use/cover, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data.

The first study, "Unintended consequences of combating desertification in China" by Su et al. (2023), uses land use/cover datasets for China with a spatial resolution of 1 km × 1 km, acquired from the Resource and Environmental Science Data Center (RESDC). The dataset covers land use/cover information for the years 1980, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, and 2018, and includes six major land use/cover categories and twenty-six subcategories. The study also uses monthly average air temperature and precipitation data from 2000 to 2018, sourced from the RESDC, and radiation data with a resolution of 1 km × 1 km from Junbang (2021).

The second study, "Global assessment of lagged and cumulative effects of drought on grassland gross primary production" by Wei et al. (2022), does not explicitly mention the datasets used. However, it does reference the use of remotely sensed vegetation data, such as NDVI, for analyzing drought impacts on grassland gross primary production.

The third study, "Time-lag effects of global vegetation responses to climate change" by Wu et al. (2015), uses meteorological data, vegetation data, and climate data from various sources. Specifically, they use monthly climate data from the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN), vegetation data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), and climate data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).

In summary, the provided context discusses various datasets related to meteorological observations, land use/cover, and NDVI data, but it does not mention the MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet datasets commonly used in deep learning research.
