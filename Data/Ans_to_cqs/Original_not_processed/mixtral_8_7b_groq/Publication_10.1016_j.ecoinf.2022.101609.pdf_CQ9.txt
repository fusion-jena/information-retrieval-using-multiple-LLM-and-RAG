Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions that Lewisham, Southwark, and Chepstow were used as case studies to develop and validate the REVIS system, but it does not specify where the data is stored or shared. It is possible that the data is not publicly available due to privacy or other concerns. If the data repository becomes available in the future, it may be hosted on a platform such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF, as you suggested.
