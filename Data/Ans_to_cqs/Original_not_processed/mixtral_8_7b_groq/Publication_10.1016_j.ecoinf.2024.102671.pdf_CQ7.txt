Answer:

The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. However, it does offer insights into various data-related concepts and techniques that are relevant to the broader field of data analysis and modeling.

In the context of ecological data, it's crucial to consider the temporal, spatial, and hierarchical structures inherent in the data. This implies that when splitting data for model training, one should aim to maintain these structures as much as possible. For instance, if the data has a temporal component, it might be more appropriate to use a time series cross-validation approach, where the data is split into training and testing sets based on time.

Moreover, the concept of cross-validation is mentioned in the context, which is a technique used to assess the generalizability and robustness of models. In the context of deep learning, cross-validation can be used to tune hyperparameters and prevent overfitting.

The context also mentions the use of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a measure of vegetation health. This index could be used as a feature in a deep learning model, and the data splitting criteria could be based on the distribution of NDVI values.

Furthermore, the concept of spatial autocorrelation is relevant when dealing with geospatial data. Spatial autocorrelation refers to the phenomenon where values of a variable are similar or dissimilar to neighboring values. When splitting data for deep learning model training, it's essential to consider spatial autocorrelation to ensure that the training and testing sets are independent.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific criteria for splitting data for deep learning model training, it does offer insights into the importance of maintaining temporal, spatial, and hierarchical structures in ecological data. Additionally, cross-validation, NDVI, and spatial autocorrelation are relevant concepts that could be considered when splitting data for deep learning model training.
