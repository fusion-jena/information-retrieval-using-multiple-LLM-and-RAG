Answer:::

While the text provided does not give a direct answer to your question, it does offer some insights based on the "Artificial Neural Network" (ANN) model mentioned in the table. The ANN is a type of deep learning model.

The preprocessing steps for an ANN or any deep learning model typically include data normalization, scaling, and cleaning. However, the text does not explicitly mention these steps in relation to the ANN model. 

Data normalization is a process that scales the data between a specific range, often between 0 and 1, to avoid any attribute dominating the others due to differences in scales. Scaling can be done using various methods, such as min-max scaling or z-score scaling.

Cleaning refers to the process of handling missing or incorrect data. This could involve removing instances with missing data, imputing missing values, or correcting erroneous entries.

The table does mention some parameters for the ANN model, such as the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons per layer. The range for these parameters suggests that the models used in the study are not very deep, as they only consider up to 5 hidden layers and up to 100 neurons per layer.

The lack of explicit mention of preprocessing steps could mean that these steps were not considered significant enough to include in the discussion, or they were assumed to be part of the standard process. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the typical preprocessing steps of normalization, scaling, and cleaning would be applied to an ANN or any deep learning model, even if not explicitly stated in the provided text.
