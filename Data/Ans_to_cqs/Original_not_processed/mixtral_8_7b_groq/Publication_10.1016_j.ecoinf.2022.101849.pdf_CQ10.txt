Answer:::
I am unable to provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline because it is not mentioned in the provided context. The context discusses a study on weakly-supervised learning for regression problems in macroecology, specifically for a case study in global vegetation modeling. However, it does not mention or provide a link to any code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study.
