Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly stated as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer. However, the context does mention the use of several machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including KNN, GP, TREE, RF, XGB, SVR, and MLP.

The paper by Reichstein et al. (2019) discusses the use of deep learning for data-driven earth system science, but it does not specify the type of deep learning model used. Instead, it focuses on the importance of understanding the underlying processes and the need for interpretable models.

The paper by Ryu et al. (2012) discusses the temporal upscaling of evapotranspiration from instantaneous remote sensing measurements to 8-day mean daily-sums. While they use machine learning algorithms, they do not mention the use of deep learning models.

The paper by Schwank et al. (2012) focuses on L-band radiative properties of vine vegetation at the MELBEX III SMOS cal/val site. They use machine learning algorithms for land surface model inversion, but again, there is no mention of deep learning models.

The paper by Garcia-Rodriguez et al. (n.d.) presents a flowchart of the proposed models, which includes XGB, SVR, and MLP. While these are deep learning algorithms, they are not classified as CNN, RNN, or Transformer.

In summary, the provided context does not specify the use of a CNN, RNN, or Transformer in the pipeline. Instead, it mentions the use of various machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including XGB, SVR, and MLP.
