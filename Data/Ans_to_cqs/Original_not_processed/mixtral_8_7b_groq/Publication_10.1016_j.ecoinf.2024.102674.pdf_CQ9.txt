Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses various methods and techniques used for modeling and analyzing data, including Random Forests (RFs), Generalized Boosted Regression Models (GBMs), Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). It also mentions different packages and software used for these analyses, such as RANDOMFOREST, GBM, and NEURALNETTOOLS. However, there is no information about where the data used in this study is stored or deposited. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query. It is possible that the data repository is not specified in the given text, and it may be available in the original research article or through direct contact with the authors.
