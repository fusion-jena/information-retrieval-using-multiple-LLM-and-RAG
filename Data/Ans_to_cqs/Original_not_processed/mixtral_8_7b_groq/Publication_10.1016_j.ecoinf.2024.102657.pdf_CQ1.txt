The text provided does not give specific details about how the raw bird song data was collected for the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the data was preprocessed into spectrograms and associated metadata. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data collection methods likely involved some form of audio recording, which could have been done through various means such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets with audio recordings of bird songs.

For instance, bird song data can be collected through surveys where ornithologists or citizen scientists manually record bird songs using audio recorders. Alternatively, data can be collected using sensors such as automated audio recording devices placed in specific habitats to capture bird songs. Additionally, there are public datasets available that contain bird song recordings, such as the Xeno-canto database, which could have been used as a source of data.

However, without more specific information about the data collection methods used in this study, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
