Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific details about the learning rate or optimizer used in the BirdNET model. However, it does mention that the BirdNET model was derived from the family of residual networks (ResNets) and has 157 layers with over 27 million parameters. The model was trained using extensive data pre-processing, augmentation, and mixup. BirdNET creates a mel-scale spectrogram between 150 Hz and 15 kHz and returns 1024 embeddings per 3-second audio sample. The final feature vector is obtained by taking the mean and standard deviation of the embeddings over the entire duration of the call.

The context also states that the model was run using Python version 3.10 and the code and methods were based on the BirdNET-Analyzer GitHub repository. However, the specific hyperparameters used in the model are not provided in the context. Therefore, I cannot give a specific answer to the query.
