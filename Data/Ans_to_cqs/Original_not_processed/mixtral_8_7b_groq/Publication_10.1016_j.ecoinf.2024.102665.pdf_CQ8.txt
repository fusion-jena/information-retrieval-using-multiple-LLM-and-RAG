Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline for detecting the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam or any other topic. The reference "Do, A.N.T., Tran, H.D., 2023. Combining a deep learning model with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming. Eco. Inform. 78, 102380." provides information about a study that combines a deep learning model with an optimization algorithm for this purpose, but it does not mention a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket link for the code repository of the deep learning pipeline.
