Answer:::

The pieces of context provided do not contain a direct example of a deep learning pipeline that uses image, audio, video, or CSV data formats. However, they do mention the use of specific data formats in various remote sensing and geospatial applications, which can give us an idea of the data formats used in deep learning pipelines for these types of applications.

For instance, the 2019 study by Ma et al. mentions the use of hyperspectral images, multispectral images, and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data in remote sensing applications using deep learning. Similarly, the 2020 study by Mandal et al. uses dual-polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 for crop growth monitoring. These studies suggest that image data formats, such as hyperspectral, multispectral, LiDAR, and SAR, are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for remote sensing and geospatial applications.

In addition, the 2013 study by Li et al. mentions the use of multi-temporal Landsat TM images for forest classification and change analysis using machine learning approaches. This example suggests that time-series data in the form of raster images (e.g., Landsat TM) can also be used in deep learning pipelines for remote sensing applications.

As for CSV data formats, the pieces of context do not provide a direct example of their use in deep learning pipelines for remote sensing or geospatial applications. However, CSV data formats are commonly used in machine learning pipelines for tabular data, such as demographic or socioeconomic data. In the context of remote sensing and geospatial applications, CSV data formats might be used for integrating ancillary data, such as climate data or land use data, into deep learning models.

In summary, image data formats, such as hyperspectral, multispectral, LiDAR, and SAR, are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for remote sensing and geospatial applications. Time-series data in the form of raster images can also be used in deep learning pipelines for remote sensing applications. Although the pieces of context do not provide a direct example of CSV data formats being used in deep learning pipelines for remote sensing or geospatial applications, CSV data formats are commonly used in machine learning pipelines for tabular data and might be used for integrating ancillary data into deep learning models.
