Answer:::

The provided context discusses Support Vector Regression (SVR) and its hyperparameters in detail, but it does not mention any specific hyperparameters used in deep learning models such as learning rate or optimizer.

Deep learning models have several hyperparameters that need to be tuned to achieve optimal performance. Some of the common hyperparameters used in deep learning models include:

1. Learning rate: It determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. A learning rate that is too small may result in slow convergence, while a learning rate that is too large may cause the model to converge to a suboptimal solution or even diverge.
2. Optimizer: It is a method used to update the weights and biases of the model based on the gradient of the loss function. Some of the commonly used optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad.
3. Number of layers and neurons: The number of layers and neurons in a deep learning model can significantly affect its performance. A larger number of layers and neurons can increase the model's capacity to learn complex patterns but may also increase the risk of overfitting.
4. Activation function: It is a non-linear function applied to the output of each neuron in the model. Common activation functions include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh.
5. Batch size: It is the number of training examples used in one iteration of the optimization algorithm. A larger batch size can result in more stable gradients but may also require more memory.

Therefore, the hyperparameters used in deep learning models depend on the specific model and the problem at hand. Proper tuning of these hyperparameters is crucial for achieving good performance in deep learning models.
