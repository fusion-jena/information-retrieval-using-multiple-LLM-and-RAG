Answer: The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the text are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that the pipeline uses a GoogLeNet architecture, which was the winner of the 2015 ImageNet competition. ImageNet is a large-scale image recognition dataset consisting of over 1 million images and 1000 classes. Therefore, it can be inferred that the pipeline uses the ImageNet dataset for training and testing the GoogLeNet architecture.

Additionally, the pipeline uses a raw training dataset of 20 fish species for building 4 different datasets to assess the influence of the dataset building on classification results. The first training dataset T1 contained raw fish thumbnails and their respective mirror images, which were created by flipping each thumbnail with respect to the vertical axis. This procedure doubled the number of thumbnails per fish individual and homogenized the proportion of left-oriented and right-oriented individuals in the database.

In summary, while the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that the pipeline uses the ImageNet dataset for training and testing the GoogLeNet architecture. Additionally, the pipeline builds 4 different datasets using a raw training dataset of 20 fish species to assess the influence of the dataset building on classification results.
