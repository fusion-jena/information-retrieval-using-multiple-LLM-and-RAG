The provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for harmful algal blooms (HABs) monitoring and prediction. However, it does discuss the use of machine learning models, including deep learning, in predicting algal-related parameters such as chlorophyll-a.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a box around an object of interest in an image. It is commonly used in object detection tasks, where the goal is to identify the presence and location of specific objects within an image.
2. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves dividing an image into multiple segments or regions, with each region representing a different class or object. It is commonly used in image segmentation tasks, where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image.
3. Instance segmentation: This technique is an extension of semantic segmentation, where each instance of an object is segmented and labeled individually. It is commonly used in tasks where the number and location of instances of an object are important, such as in object detection and tracking.

These techniques are used to train deep learning models by providing labeled data that the model can learn from. The model uses this data to identify patterns and relationships within the data, which it can then use to make predictions on new, unseen data.

In the context of HABs monitoring and prediction, data annotation techniques could be used to label water quality parameters, such as chlorophyll-a, in images or datasets. This labeled data could then be used to train a deep learning model to predict chlorophyll-a levels based on patterns and relationships within the data.

It is worth noting that the provided context does mention the use of chlorophyll-a sensor values as a predictor variable in a random forest model. This suggests that the sensor values were used as labeled data to train the model. However, the specific data annotation technique used is not mentioned.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for HABs monitoring and prediction, it is mentioned that deep learning models are used in this context. Common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. These techniques are used to provide labeled data for the model to learn from, and could be used in HABs monitoring and prediction to label water quality parameters such as chlorophyll-a.
