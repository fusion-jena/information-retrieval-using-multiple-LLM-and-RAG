Based on the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is an early stop approach. This technique involves halting the training process of a model prematurely if performance on a validation dataset fails to improve beyond a predefined threshold. This helps to prevent overfitting and conserve computational resources.

The context does not mention any other regularization methods commonly used in deep learning such as dropout or L2 regularization. Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by making the network more robust and less dependent on the training data. L2 regularization, on the other hand, adds a penalty to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights, which helps to shrink the weights towards zero and prevent overfitting.

However, it is important to note that the context does mention other techniques used to prevent overfitting, such as transfer learning and fine-tuning. Transfer learning involves using pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on a new dataset, which helps to prevent overfitting by leveraging the knowledge gained from the pre-trained models. Fine-tuning involves re-training only a few layers of the pre-trained model, which helps to adapt the model to the new dataset while still leveraging the knowledge gained from the pre-trained model.

In summary, while the context only explicitly mentions the early stop approach as a regularization method, other techniques such as transfer learning and fine-tuning are also used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
