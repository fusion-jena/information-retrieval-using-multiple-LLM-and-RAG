The text provided discusses a deep learning framework for monitoring and predicting pollutant concentration levels on UK highways, specifically focusing on the REVIS system as a case study. However, it does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

There are some indirect indications that sensors are used for data collection. For instance, the authors mention the development of the REVIS IoT hardware for data collection. Additionally, the hardware layer of the proposed framework is depicted in Figure 2, suggesting that some form of hardware is used for data acquisition. However, the text does not provide specific details about the nature of these sensors or the data they collect.

Furthermore, the authors mention evaluating the framework's ability to capture "granular pollution data," implying that the data collected is detailed and specific. However, the source or type of this granular data is not specified.

In conclusion, while there are indications that sensors are used for data collection in the REVIS system and the proposed deep learning framework, the text does not provide explicit information about the methods utilized for collecting raw data.

Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, there are indirect indications that sensors are used for data collection, as suggested by the development of the REVIS IoT hardware for data collection and the evaluation of the framework's ability to capture granular pollution data. Nonetheless, specific details about the sensors or the data they collect are not provided in the text.
