Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in the given context utilizes the Adam optimization technique. The Adam optimizer is a variant of the stochastic gradient optimization method, where the learning rate is adjusted automatically. This optimization technique is used to train a neural network for classifying three different legume species: white bean, red bean, and soybean. The learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size are set as 0.01, 150, and 2500, respectively, for training the network with the Adam optimizer.

Additionally, the max pooling operation is performed using a kernel of 2 Ã— 2 and a stride of two. After the max pooling operation, the features are flattened to a one-dimensional vector of size 400. Further, three fully connected layers are applied with 120, 84, and 2 nodes, respectively. Finally, a LogSoftMax function is applied to convert the logits into a normalized probability distribution.

It is worth noting that the optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline is not limited to the Adam optimizer. In the context, the authors have mentioned the use of pre-trained networks that are later fine-tuned with specific data of the addressed problem. This approach is known as transfer learning, where the knowledge learned from one problem is applied to another closely related problem. In this context, the authors have studied the impact of critical factors such as iteration size. However, the specific optimization techniques used in this study are not provided.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in the given context applies the Adam optimization technique for training the neural network. Additionally, the pipeline utilizes transfer learning, where pre-trained networks are fine-tuned with specific data of the addressed problem. However, the specific optimization techniques used in the transfer learning approach are not provided.
