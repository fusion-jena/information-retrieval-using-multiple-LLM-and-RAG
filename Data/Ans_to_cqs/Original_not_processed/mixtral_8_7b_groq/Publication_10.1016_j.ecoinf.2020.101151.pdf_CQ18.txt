Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no specific strategy mentioned for monitoring the model performance during training. However, it is stated that the plan is to ask a selected group of experts for feedback on the performance, usability, and reliability of the system in spring 2020. This feedback could include an evaluation of the model's performance.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of a decision support system in a similar approach to Kalabokidis et al. (2013). In this study, Kalabokidis et al. used a cross-validation method to evaluate the performance of their wildfire spread prediction model. They divided their dataset into training and testing sets and evaluated the performance of their model using statistical measures such as mean absolute error and root mean square error.

Therefore, it can be inferred that a possible strategy for monitoring the model performance during training could be the use of cross-validation methods and statistical measures to evaluate the model's performance on a regular basis. Additionally, seeking feedback from experts in the field of wildland firefighting and forest management could provide valuable insights into the model's performance and usability.

It is important to note that monitoring the model performance during training is a crucial step in developing a reliable and accurate wildfire spread prediction model. By continuously evaluating the model's performance, developers can identify any issues or biases in the model and make necessary adjustments to improve its accuracy and reliability.
