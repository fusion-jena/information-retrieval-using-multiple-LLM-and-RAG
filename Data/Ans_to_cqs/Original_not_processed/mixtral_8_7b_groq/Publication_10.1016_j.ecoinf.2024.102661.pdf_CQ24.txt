The provided context discusses the TPEBO-LSTM algorithm, a method for hyperparameter optimization in LSTM models, but it does not directly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the random seed value. Therefore, based on the given information, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.

However, it is important to note that handling randomness is a crucial aspect of deep learning model development. One common way to manage randomness is by setting a fixed random seed value. A random seed initializes the random number generator used in various processes like data shuffling, weight initialization, and dropout regularization. By setting a fixed seed value, researchers can ensure consistent and reproducible results across multiple runs of the same model.

While the context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value in the TPEBO-LSTM algorithm, it is possible that the authors have employed this practice to ensure the reproducibility of their experiments. Nonetheless, without explicit confirmation in the provided text, it is not possible to definitively state that this strategy is used in the TPEBO-LSTM algorithm.
