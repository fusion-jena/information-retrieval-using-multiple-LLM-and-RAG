Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the training and testing of algorithms using a bug-picture dataset, but it does not discuss the specific data manipulation methods used to increase the size and variability of the training set.

Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning to artificially increase the size of the training set and improve model generalization. These techniques involve creating modified versions of the original images by applying transformations such as horizontal or vertical flips, rotations, shifts, and scaling. By incorporating these augmented images into the training process, the model can learn to be more invariant to these types of transformations and thus perform better on unseen data.

However, the context provided does not mention any of these techniques. It explains that the algorithms were trained on a random subset of 5256 pictures, and the training-testing process was repeated 10 times for each algorithm. But it does not provide information on whether data augmentation techniques were applied during this process.
