Answer:::

The provided context does not specify the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers in the mentioned studies. The mentioned models are mainly traditional machine learning algorithms used for predicting species distributions, assessing human-wildlife conflicts, and analyzing the impact of human activities on wildlife.

The studies mentioned in the context use models such as Maximum Entropy (MAXENT), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), Generalized Boosted Model (GBM), Classification Tree Analyses (CTA), Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA), and Surface Response Envelope (SRE).

For instance, Venter et al. (2016) used a model called the "human footprint model" to analyze the changes in the global terrestrial human footprint and its implications for biodiversity conservation. Similarly, Wahab et al. (2021) used a logistic regression model to assess human-wildlife conflicts in Idanre Forest reserve, Nigeria.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that deep learning models are not used in the mentioned studies.
