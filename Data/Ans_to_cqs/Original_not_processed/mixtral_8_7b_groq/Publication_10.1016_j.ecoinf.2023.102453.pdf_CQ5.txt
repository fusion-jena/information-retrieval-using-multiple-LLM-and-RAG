Answer:::

The context provided does not specify the use of MNIST, CIFAR, or any other specific dataset in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of several datasets in various studies related to deep learning and computer vision.

For instance, the Caltech camera trap dataset and the Snapshot Serengeti dataset are used for species classification. These datasets contain a large number of images (243,100 and 78,000 respectively) and are used for training and testing deep learning models for image classification.

In addition, the context mentions the use of the ImageNet dataset for pre-training several neural network models, including TensorFlow Lite InceptionV3, MobileNetV2, ResNet18, EfficientNetB1, DenseNet121, and Xception. These models are pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, which contains over 14 million images belonging to 1000 classes.

Furthermore, the African elephant (Loxodonta Africana) dataset is used for fine-tuning deep learning models for species classification. The context does not provide details about the size or composition of this dataset.

Lastly, the context mentions the use of twelve pre-trained models in a study related to passive acoustic monitoring. However, it does not specify the datasets used for training these models.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the use of MNIST, CIFAR, or other specific datasets, it does mention the use of several other datasets for training and testing deep learning models for image and sound classification.
