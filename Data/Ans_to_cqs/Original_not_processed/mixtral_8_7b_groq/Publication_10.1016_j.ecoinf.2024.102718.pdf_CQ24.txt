Answer:::

Deep learning models often involve randomness in various stages of the pipeline, such as weight initialization, data shuffling, and dropout regularization. While the context provided does not directly discuss strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention specific techniques and models used in plant disease classification that implicitly deal with randomness.

1. Weight Initialization: Deep learning models require initializing weights randomly to break symmetry and ensure proper learning. For instance, Chollet (2017) introduced the Xception model, which uses depthwise separable convolutions and random weight initialization. Although the text does not explicitly discuss weight initialization strategies, it is an essential aspect of handling randomness in deep learning.

2. Data Shuffling: To avoid overfitting and ensure better generalization, deep learning models typically shuffle data during training. Although not explicitly mentioned in the context, data shuffling is an implicit way of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

3. Dropout Regularization: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out neurons during training to prevent overfitting. The DFN-PSAN model by Dai et al. (2024) uses a multi-level deep information feature fusion extraction network for interpretable plant disease classification, implying the use of dropout or other regularization techniques to handle randomness.

4. Model Ensemble: Catal Reis and Turk (2024a, 2024b) proposed an integrated deep learning and ensemble learning model for deep feature-based wheat disease detection. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve overall performance, and handling randomness is crucial for achieving consistent results.

5. Hyperparameter Optimization: S. P. Sankareshwaran et al. (2023) proposed the CAHA-AXRNet approach, which optimizes hyperparameters through the crossover-boosted artificial hummingbird algorithm. Hyperparameter optimization can help manage randomness by finding the best set of parameters for a given task.

In summary, deep learning pipelines handle randomness using various strategies, such as weight initialization, data shuffling, dropout regularization, model ensemble, and hyperparameter optimization. Although the context does not explicitly discuss these strategies, the mentioned models and techniques implicitly use these methods to manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
