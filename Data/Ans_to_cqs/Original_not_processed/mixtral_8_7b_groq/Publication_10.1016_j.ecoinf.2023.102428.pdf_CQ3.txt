Answer:::

The provided context does not contain specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for this particular study. However, I can provide some general information about common data annotation techniques in deep learning.

In computer vision tasks, data annotation is a crucial step for training deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Annotation techniques help label the data, enabling models to learn and make predictions. Some common data annotation techniques include:

1. Image-level classification: In this technique, an image is assigned to a single class or category. For example, classifying an image as 'dog' or 'cat'. This is the simplest form of annotation and is useful for tasks like image classification and object detection.

2. Bounding box annotation: This method involves drawing a bounding box around objects of interest in an image. Each box is labeled with the corresponding class. Bounding box annotation is widely used for object detection tasks, where the goal is to locate and classify objects within an image.

3. Semantic segmentation: Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding class. This technique is useful for tasks where precise object boundaries are important, such as image segmentation, medical image analysis, and autonomous driving.

4. Instance segmentation: Instance segmentation combines object detection and semantic segmentation. It not only classifies each pixel but also distinguishes between instances of the same class. For example, identifying and segmenting individual cars in an image. Instance segmentation is particularly useful in scenarios where counting and tracking individual objects are important.

5. Land use/land cover (LULC) annotation: In remote sensing and GIS applications, LULC annotation is used to label land cover classes in satellite or aerial images. This annotation technique is relevant to the provided context, as the study uses LULC data for land cover classification and prediction.

Without specific information from the context, it is difficult to determine which of these techniques were used in the study. However, considering the focus on land use/land cover classification and prediction, it is plausible that LULC annotation was employed.
