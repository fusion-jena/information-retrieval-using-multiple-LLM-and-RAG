Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about post-processing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix after model training. However, the context does mention that the models were evaluated, but it does not go into detail about how this evaluation was performed. It is possible that metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were calculated, but this is not explicitly stated. Similarly, while the context discusses the creation of a test set, it does not mention the creation of a confusion matrix, which is a common tool for visualizing the performance of a classification model. Therefore, while it is possible that these post-processing steps were taken, the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.
