Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the post-processing steps taken after training the models. However, it does mention some details about model validation and model prediction steps.

Model validation is done using a separate validation group from the training data to track the generalization performance of the model. This is done to prevent overfitting or underfitting of the model.

After training and validating the model, the model is used for prediction. The models used in the study include Decision tree, Random forest, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and a Stacked GRU-DNN model. The prediction performance of these models is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (Mae) as the criterion.

As for post-processing steps, Saliency maps are not explicitly mentioned in the context. Saliency maps are a way to visualize the importance of input features towards the prediction made by the model. However, the context does mention the use of a Confusion matrix for evaluating the performance of the Decision tree model in classifying significant wave height and water temperature.

In summary, based on the provided context, the post-processing steps involved after model training include model validation, prediction, and evaluation using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error and Confusion matrix. However, there is no explicit mention of Saliency maps.
