Answer:::
In the deep learning model used in the study, the following hyperparameters were used:

1. Learning rate: The learning rate used was 10.
2. Optimizer: The specific type of optimizer used in the study was not mentioned in the provided context.
3. Regression loss: The mean scaled absolute error was used as the regression loss.
4. Batch size: A batch size of 1 was used.
5. Input image resolution: The input image resolution used was 5 Ã— 768 pixels.
6. Data augmentation: Only horizontal flipping was used for data augmentation.
7. Pre-trained model: A ResNet50 model pre-trained on the ImageNet classification dataset with added FPN was used as a baseline comparison.

It's important to note that the study used a segmentation pre-training approach, which involves training the network on larger datasets first, followed by fine-tuning the network on the target task. This approach has been shown to improve the performance of CNNs, especially when there is little training data available for plant cover estimation.
