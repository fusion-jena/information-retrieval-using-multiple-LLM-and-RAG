Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves several techniques to ensure the model's accuracy and prevent overfitting.

Firstly, the training set is preprocessed using a MinMaxScaler that transforms each feature to a [0-1] range, which helps in the stable training of the model.

Secondly, the LSTM model is trained using the mean squared error (MSE) as a loss function and the ADAM optimization algorithm. The use of MSE as a loss function allows the model to minimize the average squared difference between the actual and predicted values, providing a stable gradient for the optimization process.

Thirdly, a dropout layer is added to the model as a regularization method. The dropout layer randomly excludes some inputs from activation and weight updates while training the network, which helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's generalization ability.

Fourthly, the distribution of values in the training set is made more similar to the one of the test period, which helps in improving the model's performance during testing.

Lastly, the model's performance is evaluated using several metrics, including RMSE, MAE, and MRE. These metrics provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's accuracy and allow for a comparison of the model's performance with other models.

In addition, the number of observations in the training set and the percentage of out-of-range observations in the test set are also reported, which helps in understanding the model's performance in different scenarios.

Overall, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves a combination of preprocessing, optimization, regularization, and evaluation techniques, which help ensure the model's accuracy and prevent overfitting.
