Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline described in the given context uses dropout as a regularization method to prevent overfitting. Specifically, a dropout layer is added to the fully connected layer of the network. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to make the network more robust and prevents overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons. The dropout rate in this case is 0.4, which means that 40% of the neurons are dropped out during training. No other regularization methods such as L2 regularization are explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
