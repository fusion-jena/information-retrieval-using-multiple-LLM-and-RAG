Answer:::

The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a systematic approach, but the context does not explicitly specify whether a grid search or random search is used. However, it does provide details about the parameters used for the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimization technique in the training process.

For the ResNet models, the learning rate is set to start at 0.001 and is decreased every 10 epochs by a factor of 0.1. The SGD optimization technique is utilized with a momentum of 0.9. These parameters were found to give the best results in evaluations.

For the SlowFast architecture, the initial base learning rate is set to 0.1, and the learning rate is decreased using a cosine strategy. Warmup epochs are used to gradually increase the learning rate from an initial value of 0.001 to the base learning rate. The SGD optimization technique is used with a momentum of 0.9 and a weight decay parameter of 4.

In both cases, the parameters were systematically varied and evaluated to find the best combination. However, the context does not provide information on whether a grid search or random search was used. It is possible that a manual tuning approach was taken, where parameters were adjusted based on the results of previous runs.
