Based on the provided context, the datasets used in the research described do not appear to be related to the deep learning image classification datasets commonly referred to, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

In the research paper "Verification of novel integrations of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning neural network for flood susceptibility mapping," the authors use a dataset for flood susceptibility mapping in China. However, the specifics of this dataset are not provided in the context.

In the second research paper "Evolution of the dry-wet variations since 1834 CE in the Lüliang Mountains, North China and its relationship with the Asian summer monsoon," the authors use tree-ring data from the Lüliang Mountains in North China to analyze the dry-wet variations and their relationship with the Asian summer monsoon.

In the third research paper "A comprehensive characterization of MODIS daily burned area mapping accuracy across fire sizes in tropical savannas," the authors use MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) burned area data to analyze the mapping accuracy of burned areas in tropical savannas.

Lastly, the provided context includes a reference to NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) data generated from AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) sensors by the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling Studies (GIMMS) but does not specify its use in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not specified in the provided context.
