Answer:::
The deep learning model for wetland classification is trained using specific hardware resources, including a CPU, GPU, and RAM. According to the context, the experiments were conducted using an Intel Core i7-10750H 2.60 GHz CPU. Additionally, a GPU, specifically the GeForce RTX 2070-MaxQ, was employed to accelerate the training process. The model training also utilized 16GB of RAM. However, the text does not mention the use of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) for training.
