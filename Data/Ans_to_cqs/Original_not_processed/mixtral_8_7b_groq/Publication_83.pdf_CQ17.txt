Answer:::

Based on the provided context, specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline for bird sound classification are not mentioned. However, it is mentioned that a VGG-style network is used, which has been previously used for classifying acoustic scenes. In the VGG network, common regularization techniques include dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by promoting independence among the neurons. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights. This encourages smaller weights, which in turn helps to reduce overfitting.

In addition, data augmentation techniques such as time stretching, pitch shifting, and adding background noise are used to improve bird sound classifications. These techniques can also help to reduce overfitting by increasing the amount of training data and providing more variability.

Therefore, while the specific regularization techniques used in the bird sound classification deep learning pipeline are not mentioned in the provided context, it is likely that dropout and L2 regularization were used in the VGG-style network, and data augmentation techniques were used to further prevent overfitting.
