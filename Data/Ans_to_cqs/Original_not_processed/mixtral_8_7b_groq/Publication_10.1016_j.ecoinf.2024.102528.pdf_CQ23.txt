Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a particular deep learning model. However, it does mention the use of deep learning models in a few studies.

In the study by He et al., 2016, the authors introduce Deep Residual Learning for image recognition. They mention that they used the ILSVRC 2012 dataset, which contains 1.2 million images for training, and 50,000 for testing. This dataset is diverse and large, which could have helped in increasing the generalizability of their model. However, they do not explicitly mention any other measures such as cross-validation or stratified splitting.

In the study by Kahl et al., 2021, the authors developed BirdNET, a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring. They used a dataset of over 2 million annotated bird songs from over 2500 species. The data was collected from various sources, including xeno-canto, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, and the Macaulay Library. This diverse dataset could have helped in increasing the generalizability of their model. However, they do not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of their model.

In the study by Wood et al., 2022, the authors developed the BirdNET app, which uses machine learning to identify bird songs. They mention that they used a dataset of over 1 million bird songs, collected from various sources. They do not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of their model.

In conclusion, while the studies mentioned in the provided context used diverse and large datasets, they do not explicitly mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of their deep learning models, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting.
