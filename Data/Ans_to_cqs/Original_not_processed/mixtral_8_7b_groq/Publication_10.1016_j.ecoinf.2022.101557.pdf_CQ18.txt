Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of validation samples that are randomly selected from all areas used in the training set. These validation samples are not used to fit the model and serve as a means to assess the model's performance throughout the training process. Specifically, the model's performance is evaluated after every 150 epochs, which is the number of times the learning algorithm works through the entire training dataset. Additionally, a batch size of 128 is used, meaning the model is trained on 128 samples before the weights are updated.

To further ensure the model's performance and stability, dropout with a rate of 0.3 is employed. Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons.

Moreover, the ADAM optimization algorithm with a learning rate of 0.0001 is used to find the optimal weights in the neural network. ADAM is an adaptive learning rate method, meaning it adjusts the learning rate based on the past gradients' statistics, which helps find the minimum cross-entropy loss between the network's predictions and the pre-labelled data more effectively.

However, the text does not explicitly mention other performance monitoring strategies like early stopping, learning rate scheduling, or using different evaluation metrics during training. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary strategy for monitoring model performance during training involves using validation samples, dropout, and ADAM optimization algorithm.
