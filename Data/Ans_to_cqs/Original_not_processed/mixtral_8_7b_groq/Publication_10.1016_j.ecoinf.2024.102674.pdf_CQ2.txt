Answer:::

The specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the Dujardin and Lehning (2022) study is not explicitly stated in the given text. However, it can be inferred that the input data is in the form of gridded climate surfaces, which are raster datasets. Raster datasets are a common format for spatial data, where each cell in the grid contains a value representing a specific variable, such as temperature or precipitation.

In the study, the authors used WorldClim 2 (Fick and Hijmans, 2017) and CHELSA (Karger et al., 2017) as the input climate datasets, which are both provided as raster datasets. These datasets were then downscaled using a deep learning model to obtain high-resolution topography data.

Additionally, the study used weather station data to evaluate the performance of the downscaling method. It is likely that the weather station data was provided in a tabular format, such as a CSV file, where each row contains a record of a weather observation, including the date, time, and variable measurements.

Therefore, while the specific data format used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the input data is in the form of raster datasets, and the evaluation data is in the form of tabular datasets.
