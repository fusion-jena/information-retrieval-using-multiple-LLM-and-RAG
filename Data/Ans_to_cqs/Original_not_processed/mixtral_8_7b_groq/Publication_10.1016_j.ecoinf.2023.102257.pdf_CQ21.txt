Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps taken after model training. However, it does mention the use of a confusion matrix in the context of evaluating the effects of ML model performance on tagging efficiency.

A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It contains information about the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative counts, which can be used to calculate various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Therefore, it can be inferred that one of the postprocessing steps involved after model training is the calculation of these metrics using a confusion matrix.

Additionally, the context also mentions the use of a generalized linear mixed model to examine the influence of ML model performance and tagging method on tagging efficiency. This suggests that statistical analysis of the model's performance may be another postprocessing step.

However, there is no mention of other postprocessing techniques such as saliency maps or feature importance analysis. Therefore, it cannot be confirmed that these techniques were used in this particular case.

In summary, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after model training include the calculation of metrics using a confusion matrix and statistical analysis of the model's performance. However, there is no explicit information about other postprocessing techniques such as saliency maps.
