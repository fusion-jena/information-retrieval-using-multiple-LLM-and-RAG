Answer:::

The context provided does not contain specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for remote sensing applications. However, it is mentioned that the studies use remote sensing sequence data, hyperspectral data, high-resolution remote sensing imagery, and Sentinel-2 time series for training and validating their deep learning models.

Remote sensing data can be collected using various sensors, including satellite, airborne, and drone-based sensors. Satellite sensors, such as Landsat, Sentinel-2, and MODIS, provide multispectral or hyperspectral images of the Earth's surface, which can be used for land cover classification, object detection, and change detection. Airborne sensors, such as LiDAR, provide high-resolution elevation data, which can be used for 3D modeling and vegetation analysis. Drone-based sensors provide very high-resolution images, which can be used for detailed object detection and classification.

Public datasets, such as the IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset, the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning Repository, and the European Space Agency's Sentinel Hub, provide remote sensing data for research and development purposes. These datasets can be used for training and validating deep learning models for remote sensing applications.

In summary, remote sensing data for deep learning applications can be collected using various sensors, including satellite, airborne, and drone-based sensors. Public datasets are also available for training and validating deep learning models for remote sensing applications. However, the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for remote sensing applications are not provided in the given context.
