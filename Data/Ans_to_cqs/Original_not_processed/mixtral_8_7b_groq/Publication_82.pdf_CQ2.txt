Answer:::
In the deep learning pipeline described in the text, the data format used is images. The study focuses on the classification problem of plant disease detection using leaf images. The images are used as input to the deep convolutional neural networks, specifically AlexNet and GoogLeNet architectures. The images are sourced from the PlantVillage dataset, which contains color, grayscale, and leaf segmented images. Therefore, the data format used in this deep learning pipeline is images, more specifically leaf images.

The preprocessing of the image data involves resizing the images to 256x256 pixels and then randomly cropping them to 224x224 pixels. This is done to ensure that the input to the neural networks is of a consistent size. The images are also normalized, which involves subtracting the mean RGB pixel intensity from each pixel and dividing by the standard deviation. This normalization is done to improve the training of the neural networks.

The deep convolutional neural networks used in this study, AlexNet and GoogLeNet, are designed to process image data. These networks consist of multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The convolutional layers apply filters to the input image to extract features, such as edges and shapes. The pooling layers reduce the spatial size of the convolved feature to reduce the amount of parameters and computation in the network. The fully connected layers perform the classification task by mapping the extracted features to the output classes.

In summary, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the text is images, specifically leaf images. The images are preprocessed by resizing, random cropping, and normalization before being fed into the deep convolutional neural networks. The networks used, AlexNet and GoogLeNet, are designed to process image data and extract features for classification.
