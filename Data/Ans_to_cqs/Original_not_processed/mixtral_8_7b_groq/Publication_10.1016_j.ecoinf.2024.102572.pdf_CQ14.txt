Based on the provided context, there is no information given about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses a formula for calculating fire severity and combustion efficiency (Mi) in relation to forest types, areas, above-ground biomass, and combustion efficiency. However, it does not mention any methods for hyperparameter optimization such as grid search, random search, or others. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
