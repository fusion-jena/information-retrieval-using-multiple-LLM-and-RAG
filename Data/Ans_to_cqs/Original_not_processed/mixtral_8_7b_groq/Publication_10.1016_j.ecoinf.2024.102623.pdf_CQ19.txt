Answer:::

The text provided does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework was used to build the model. It discusses the architecture and training process of the model in detail, but it doesn't specify whether it was built using TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other deep learning framework. Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question.
