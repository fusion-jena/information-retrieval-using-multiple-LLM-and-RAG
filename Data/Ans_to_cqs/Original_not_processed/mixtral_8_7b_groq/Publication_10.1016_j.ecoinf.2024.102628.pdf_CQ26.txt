Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning for forest classification and unveiling the gradient of forest structural shifts along a topographic gradient. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

Based on common practices in deep learning and the information provided, we can infer that the following techniques might have been used:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain characteristics, and then splitting the data so that each subset is proportionally represented in both the training and testing sets. This can help ensure that the model is exposed to the full range of data variability during training.

2. Data augmentation: This technique involves artificially increasing the size of the dataset by applying transformations to the existing data, such as rotation, scaling, or flipping. This can help increase the diversity of the data and reduce overfitting.

3. Transfer learning: This technique involves using a pre-trained model on a related task as a starting point for training a new model. This can help ensure that the new model is exposed to a diverse range of data during training, even if the new dataset is small.

4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves making a concerted effort to collect data from a wide range of sources and representing a variety of perspectives. This can help ensure that the model is exposed to a diverse range of data during training and reduce the risk of bias.

In the provided context, the authors mention that they tripled the image pool for each transect by incorporating multi-temporal data, and that they employed a LOGO (Leave-One-Group-Out) cross-validation approach. These techniques could potentially help increase the diversity of the data and reduce overfitting, but they do not explicitly address data bias.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give a clear answer to the query, we can infer that the authors may have used some of the above techniques to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, this is not explicitly stated in the provided information.
