Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in the study include a train split and a test split. The train split refers to the portion of the dataset used to train the model, and in this study, it achieved an accuracy of 0.83. The test split, on the other hand, is the portion of the dataset used to evaluate the model's performance, and it achieved an accuracy of 0.74.

The study did not explicitly mention the use of a validation split, which is typically used to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. However, based on the discussion of the model's convergence and the use of dropout layers for regularization, it can be inferred that the model's performance was evaluated using a validation set.

The specific ratio of the data split between the train and test sets was also not mentioned in the study. However, it is a common practice in deep learning to use 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.

Overall, the study used a train-test split to evaluate the model's performance, and possibly a validation set for hyperparameter tuning and regularization. However, the specific ratio of the data split and the use of a validation set were not explicitly mentioned.
