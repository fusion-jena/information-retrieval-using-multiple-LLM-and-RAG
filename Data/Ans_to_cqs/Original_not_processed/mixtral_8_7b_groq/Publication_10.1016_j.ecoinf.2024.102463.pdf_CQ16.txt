Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of using validation loss plateau as a criterion to determine when training is complete. However, the text does describe a process of model optimization involving hyperparameter determination and parameter training.

During this process, the data is standardized, and a training base is defined to calculate and apply standardization parameters to other datasets considered as test bases. The best result of the optimization will allow determining the base that will be used for training.

Moreover, the influence of the training base on the results is observed by swapping the training size. A clear improvement in predictions and a stabilization of the error can be seen when the training size reaches 50%, corresponding to data from April 1983 to February 1995. This period can be divided into two time intervals: the first one from 1983 to 1992, where high concentrations of 137Cs are found in the SPM of Rh√¥ne-Vallabregues station, and the second period from 1992 to 1995, characterized by a very strong decrease in 137Cs concentrations due to the STEL facility installed in 1992.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the training process is determined by the optimization algorithm and experimental design, and the training base size and selection are based on the analysis of the data's behavior over specific time intervals. However, the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of validation loss plateau as a criterion for determining when training is complete.
