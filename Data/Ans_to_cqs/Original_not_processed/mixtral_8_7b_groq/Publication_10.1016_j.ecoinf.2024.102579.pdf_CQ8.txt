Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about a deep learning pipeline or a code repository in platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The context focuses on the application and comparison of different estimators, namely the inventory estimator, NN1, NN2, NN3, and NN4 estimators, in the context of continuous cover forestry and ecological informatics.

These estimators seem to be part of a statistical analysis or simulation study, but there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or code repository related to this work. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
