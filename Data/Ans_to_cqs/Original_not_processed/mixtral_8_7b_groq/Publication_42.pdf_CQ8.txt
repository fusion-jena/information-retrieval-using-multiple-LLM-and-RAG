Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the comparison of different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for species classification, discussing various models' performance, and the number of learnable parameters. However, it does not mention where the code for this pipeline is located. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
