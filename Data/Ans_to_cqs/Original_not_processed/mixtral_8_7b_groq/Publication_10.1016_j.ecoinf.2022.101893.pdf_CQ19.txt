Answer:::
The deep learning model in this experiment is built using the TensorFlow 2.6 platform. This is stated explicitly in the context, which mentions that "TensorFlow 2.6 as deep learning platform" is used in the experiment. No other deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch, are mentioned as being used in the experiment. Therefore, it can be confidently said that only TensorFlow 2.6 was used to build the deep learning model in this case.
