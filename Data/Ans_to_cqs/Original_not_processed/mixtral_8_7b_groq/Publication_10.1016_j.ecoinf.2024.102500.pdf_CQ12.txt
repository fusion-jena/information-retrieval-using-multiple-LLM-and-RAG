Answer:

 The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers in the described pipeline. The focus of the pipeline seems to be on optimizing machine learning models for water quality parameters (WQPs) using the Lazy Predict library and hyperparameter tuning techniques.

The models selected for optimization are XGB, RF, and ET, which are abbreviations for eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Extra Trees, respectively. These are ensemble machine learning models, not deep learning models.

Furthermore, the final model developed is a stacking-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) meta model. While ANNs are a type of deep learning model, the context does not provide enough information to conclude that a deep learning model (CNN, RNN, or Transformer) was used in the pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be concluded that the pipeline does not use any deep learning models such as CNNs, RNNs, or Transformers.
