Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the deployment of a deep learning model, including model serialization or platform selection. Instead, the text focuses on the process of creating and evaluating ensemble models for ecological problems.

The process for creating and evaluating these models includes:

1. Obtaining presences (i.e., data points of interest) and generating background points (i.e., data points used for comparison).
2. Separating the data into folds for cross-validation, setting aside one fold as an external evaluation dataset and using the remaining folds as training data.
3. Performing scale optimization for environmental covariates by calculating focal statistics for each covariate using a moving window of varying radii and comparing scales using t-tests.
4. Subsampling background points in the training data to create three datasets with different numbers of background points.
5. Training component models separately using each background point subsample.
6. Evaluating component models using the evaluation dataset, using metrics such as AUC (Area Under the Curve) and TSS (True Skill Statistic).

However, the provided context does not mention any steps related to deploying a deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
