The provided context does not specify the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, it mentions the use of deep learning for land use and land cover classification based on hyperspectral and multispectral earth observation data.

Vali et al. (2020) provide a review of deep learning techniques for land use and land cover classification. They discuss various deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers. For hyperspectral and multispectral data, CNNs are often used due to their ability to extract spatial features from images.

Prasai et al. (2021) use the Google Earth Engine Python API and NAIP imagery for land use and land cover classification in Florida, USA. While they mention using deep learning, they do not specify the exact type of model used. However, given the nature of their study and the review by Vali et al. (2020), it is possible that they used a CNN for their classification task.

Therefore, while the exact type of deep learning model used is not specified in the provided context, it is likely that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was used for the land use and land cover classification task.
