Answer:::

The text provided does not explicitly mention the use of a specific deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers. However, it does mention the use of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), specifically a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. MLPs are a type of feedforward neural network and are considered a fundamental type of artificial neural network. They consist of at least three layers of nodes: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The term "deep learning" is typically used to refer to models with many hidden layers, but the text provided only mentions two hidden neurons in the MLP used for carbon stock estimation. Therefore, based on the information given, it can be concluded that the pipeline uses a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, which is a type of artificial neural network, but not a deep learning model with many hidden layers such as a CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
