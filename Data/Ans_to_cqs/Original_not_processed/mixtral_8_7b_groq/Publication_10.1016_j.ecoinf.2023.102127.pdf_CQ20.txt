Answer:::
Based on the provided context, the information about the use of specific hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs for training deep learning models is not available. The text focuses on discussing the "ibis.iSDM" package, which supports seven different engines for inferring or projecting the relative habitat suitability of biodiversity features. These engines include regularized elastic net regressions, Bayesian regularized "Spike-and-Slab" regressions, Bayesian additive regression trees, monotonic gradient descent boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. However, it does not mention any details about the use of specialized hardware for deep learning model training.

It is important to note that deep learning models often require significant computational resources, and training them can be quite time-consuming. Thus, using hardware accelerators like GPUs or TPUs is a common practice to speed up the training process. Unfortunately, without additional context or information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
