Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when the training of the UMAP model is complete. The text describes the process of constructing and testing the UMAP model for species distribution, but it does not mention any details about the training process convergence or early stopping.

In general, when training machine learning models, including binary classifiers like UMAP, it is common to use validation loss plateau or early stopping criteria to prevent overfitting and determine when the training process can be considered complete. These criteria typically involve monitoring the performance of the model on a validation dataset during training and stopping the training process when the performance on the validation dataset stops improving or starts degrading, even if the performance on the training dataset continues to improve.

However, the provided context does not mention any details about monitoring the performance of the UMAP model on a validation dataset or using early stopping criteria. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query.
