Answer:::
The performance of the deep learning model for landslide susceptibility mapping is evaluated using several metrics. These include Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). 

Accuracy is the ratio of the correctly predicted observations to the total observations. Precision, also known as Positive Predictive Value, is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations. Recall, also known as Sensitivity or True Positive Rate, is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class. F1-Score is the weighted average of Precision and Recall. It tries to find the balance between precision and recall.

The AUC-ROC curve is a performance measurement for classification problem at various thresholds settings. ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents degree or measure of separability. It tells how much model is capable of distinguishing between classes. Higher the AUC, the better the model is at distinguishing between landslide and non-landslide pixels.

The Kappa Score is a statistical measure of the agreement between two raters. It is generally considered a more robust measure than simple accuracy, as it takes into account the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance.

In the study, four assessment metrics were employed on the test dataset, including AUC-ROC, overall accuracy, Kappa Score, and F1-Score. The test dataset contains 20% of the landslide inventory data, that is 243 landslides and 243 non-landslide records.

These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance in terms of its ability to correctly identify landslide pixels (True Positives), its ability to avoid incorrectly identifying non-landslide pixels as landslide pixels (False Positives), and its ability to correctly identify non-landslide pixels (True Negatives). 

In the study, the highest accuracy was achieved when uniform weights were assigned to each model, specifically a weight of 0.2 for each, meaning equal contribution from all models. This suggests that the ensemble learning approach was effective in enhancing the prediction accuracy of the deep learning model.
