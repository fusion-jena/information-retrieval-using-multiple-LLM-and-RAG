Answer:::

Based on the provided context, while the text does not explicitly mention the specific postprocessing steps taken after model training, it does mention some metrics and evaluations that are likely performed.

After training the models ResNet-50, Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), and HuBERT, the performance of these models is evaluated using a test dataset that includes 187 possum vocalizations and 313 noise samples. This evaluation includes reporting both the validation and test dataset performance. 

The test dataset is used to evaluate the model, likely by comparing the model's predictions to the actual labels of the test set. This allows for the calculation of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of classification models.

Additionally, a confusion matrix could also be used as a postprocessing step to evaluate the performance of the models. A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm across different classes. The number of false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives can be observed from the confusion matrix which in turn can help calculate other metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

The context does not mention any saliency maps as a postprocessing step. Saliency maps are a technique used to highlight the important features in the input data that the model is using to make its predictions. This can be useful for interpretability and understanding how the model is making its decisions. However, the text does not mention this as a postprocessing step.
