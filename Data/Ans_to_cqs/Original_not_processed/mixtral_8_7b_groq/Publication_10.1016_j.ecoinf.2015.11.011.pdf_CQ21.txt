Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training in the described study. However, it does mention some techniques and methods used in the overall analysis that could be part of postprocessing in similar studies.

First, the study employed a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) for modeling. While the text does not explicitly mention it, evaluating the model's performance is crucial after training. This could involve calculating metrics such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), R-squared, or Cohen's kappa coefficient.

Second, the study discusses the use of segmentation and classification strategies in eCognition. Although not specified as a postprocessing step, generating saliency maps could be part of the analysis. Saliency maps highlight the most important features or areas in an image, which could be useful for validating the segmentation and classification results.

Third, the study mentions the use of machine learning techniques for classifying images. After training a machine learning model, it's common to create a confusion matrix to assess the model's performance. A confusion matrix compares the predicted classes with the actual classes, providing information about false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives.

Lastly, the study mentions the need for supervision and validation using aerial photo interpretation techniques or other data sources. This step could be considered part of the postprocessing phase, where the model's results are compared with other data sources or expert interpretations to assess the model's accuracy and reliability.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly list the postprocessing steps after model training, it does mention several techniques and methods that are typically used in postprocessing, such as calculating metrics, generating saliency maps, creating confusion matrices, and validating the model's results using other data sources or expert interpretations.
