Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model for predicting water quality parameters using hyperspectral data. However, it does provide some insights into the general steps that are typically involved in deploying a machine learning model.

Firstly, the trained deep learning model would need to be serialized, which involves saving the model's architecture, weights, and other relevant information in a file format that can be later loaded and used for making predictions. Model serialization is an essential step in the model deployment process as it allows the model to be easily shared and used by others.

Once the model is serialized, the next step is to select a platform for deploying the model. The platform could be a local machine, a cloud-based server, or an edge device, depending on the use case and the resources available. The context suggests that hyperspectral data can be used to predict water quality parameters with better accuracy and performance using orbital hyperspectral data. Therefore, the platform selected for deploying the model should be capable of handling large volumes of hyperspectral data efficiently.

After selecting the platform, the serialized model can be loaded and used for making predictions. The context suggests that the number and spatial distribution of the samples, and the influence of different atmospheric correction algorithms are essential parameters that should be considered while creating a representative dataset for training the model. Therefore, the deployed model should be able to handle data preprocessing tasks such as atmospheric correction and data normalization to ensure that the input data is in a format that the model can use for making predictions.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model for predicting water quality parameters using hyperspectral data, it does provide some insights into the general steps involved in the model deployment process. These steps include model serialization, platform selection, loading the serialized model, and handling data preprocessing tasks.
