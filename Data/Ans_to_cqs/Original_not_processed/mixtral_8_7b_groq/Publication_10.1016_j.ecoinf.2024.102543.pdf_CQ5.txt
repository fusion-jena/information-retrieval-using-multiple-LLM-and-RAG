Answer:::
The text provided does not explicitly name the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does give a detailed description of the composition and purpose of the training, validation, and testing sets used in this particular study.

The training set, which is the largest dataset, comprises 82% of the total data or 4000 images. This set is used to train the model and adjust its parameters, allowing it to learn from a diverse range of examples and patterns in the data.

The validation set, which consists of 13% or 607 images, is utilized during training to fine-tune hyperparameters and assess the model's performance on unseen data. This helps to prevent overfitting and ensures generalization.

Lastly, the testing set, which includes 5% or 260 images, serves as an independent evaluation of the model's performance on completely unseen data. This provides a reliable measure of its real-world effectiveness and ability to generalize.

While these datasets are not as well-known as some others in the field of deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, they serve the critical functions of training, validating, and testing the model in this specific research.
