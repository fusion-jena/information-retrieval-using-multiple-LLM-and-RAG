Answer:::

The provided texts discuss various aspects of machine learning and deep learning, including the challenges posed by data distribution shifts in real-world applications. However, they do not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Nevertheless, I can provide a general overview of such techniques based on common practices in the field.

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain characteristics (strata) and then ensuring that each stratum is proportionally represented in both the training and testing sets. This can help maintain the balance of classes in the presence of imbalanced data.

2. Oversampling: In oversampling, instances from the minority class are replicated to balance the class distribution. This can help the model learn more about the underrepresented class. However, it may lead to overfitting if not done carefully.

3. Undersampling: Undersampling is the opposite of oversampling, where instances from the majority class are removed to balance the class distribution. This technique can help reduce overfitting but may result in loss of valuable information.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources, conditions, and viewpoints can help increase the diversity of the dataset. This can improve the model's ability to generalize and reduce its sensitivity to specific data biases.

5. Data augmentation: Data augmentation techniques, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping, can create new instances from the existing data, increasing the dataset's size and diversity. This can help the model learn more about the data's inherent variability and reduce its dependence on specific patterns.

Please note that these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, but they are commonly used in the field of deep learning to address data bias during preprocessing.
