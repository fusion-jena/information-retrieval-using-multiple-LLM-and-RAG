Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that 10-fold cross-validation was used during the training process and mean RMSE was used as the objective function. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a model will generalize to an independent data set by dividing the training data into n subsets and training the model n times, each time leaving out one of the subsets from training and using it as the validation set. The mean RMSE is the average of the RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) values obtained from each of these runs.

In addition, the context mentions that different optimizers were tested and their performance was compared using the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test with paired samples. This suggests that the training process involved trying different optimization algorithms and comparing their performance on the validation set.

It is common practice to use early stopping as a criterion for determining when training is complete. Early stopping is a form of regularization where training is halted as soon as the validation loss starts to decrease, or after a certain number of epochs if the validation loss does not improve. This helps to prevent overfitting and can result in better generalization performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, it can be inferred that cross-validation and early stopping were likely used to prevent overfitting and ensure good generalization performance.
