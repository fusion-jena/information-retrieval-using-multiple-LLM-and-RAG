Based on the provided context, it does not contain information specific to deep learning model preprocessing steps. However, in general, preprocessing steps for machine learning models, including deep learning, can include normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

Normalization is the process of rescaling numeric columns in the dataset to a common range, often between 0 and 1. This can help deep learning models converge during training and improve their performance. Scaling is similar to normalization but rescales features to have a specific variance, often a unit variance.

Cleaning involves handling missing values, outliers, and duplicate data points. Missing values can be imputed using various strategies, such as mean or median imputation, or removing rows with missing values. Outliers can be handled by capping, removing, or transforming the data. Duplicate data points can be removed or combined, depending on the context.

Additionally, feature engineering can be performed to create new features from existing ones, such as polynomial or interaction features. This can help deep learning models capture complex relationships in the data.

It is important to note that the context provided discusses a specific application of machine learning to predict soil classes in semi-arid landscapes. The preprocessing steps taken in this study may differ from those taken in other applications or with deep learning models specifically. However, the general preprocessing steps mentioned above are commonly used in machine learning and deep learning applications.
