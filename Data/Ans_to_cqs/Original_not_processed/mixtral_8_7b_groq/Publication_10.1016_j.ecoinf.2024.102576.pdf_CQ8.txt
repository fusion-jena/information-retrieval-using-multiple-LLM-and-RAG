Answer:::

The provided pieces of context do not give information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The sources mention various studies and guidelines related to the use of deep learning models for land cover classification and ecological information extraction. However, they do not include details about the specific code repository for any of these projects. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query. It is suggested to contact the authors of the relevant research papers to inquire about the code repository.
