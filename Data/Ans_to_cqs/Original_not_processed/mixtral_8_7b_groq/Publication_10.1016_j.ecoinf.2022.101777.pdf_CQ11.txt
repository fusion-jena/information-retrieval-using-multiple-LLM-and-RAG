Answer:::
I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the necessary information to answer your query. The context consists of several research papers and related information in the field of Ecological Informatics, published in 2022, by various authors, including C. Acu√±a-Alonso and colleagues. The research was funded by the Universidade de Vigo and involved a deep learning pipeline, as indicated in the paper titles. However, there is no mention of a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.

The context does mention that data will be made available on request and provides acknowledgements and funding details. Additionally, there is a reference to supplementary data online at a specific DOI, but it does not appear to be related to the deep learning pipeline data repository link you are seeking.

In conclusion, I cannot provide the requested data repository link for the deep learning pipeline based on the given context. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
