Answer:::

In the context provided, the criterion for splitting the data for deep learning model training is based on the number of deer instances in each image. The dataset is initially divided into separate subsets based on the number of deer in each image. This is done because the distribution of deer numbers across the different images in the dataset is unbalanced, which may raise concerns if the dataset is randomly divided into training, validation, and testing subsets. 

Within each subset, the images are further partitioned into three sections using a ratio of 75:15:15. This partitioning is done to ensure that the training, validation, and testing sets have a balanced distribution of deer instances. 

This method of splitting the data is crucial because the deep learning model's performance can be significantly affected by the composition of the training, validation, and testing sets. If the distribution of deer instances is not balanced, the model may be biased towards detecting a certain number of deer instances, which can negatively impact its performance on images with a different number of deer instances. 

Therefore, by splitting the data based on the number of deer instances, the model can be trained, validated, and tested on a diverse range of images, thereby improving its ability to detect deer instances accurately, regardless of their number.
