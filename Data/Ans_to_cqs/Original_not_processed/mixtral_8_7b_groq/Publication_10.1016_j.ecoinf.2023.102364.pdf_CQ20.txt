Answer:::

The provided article does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of machine learning ensemble models, specifically RandomForest, Treenet, CART, and MARS. However, it does not specify if these models were trained using GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware accelerators. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
