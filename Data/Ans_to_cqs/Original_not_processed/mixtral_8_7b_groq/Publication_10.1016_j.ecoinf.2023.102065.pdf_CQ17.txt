Answer:::

The provided context discusses various aspects of deep learning and its applications, but it does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge of deep learning techniques, there are several regularization methods commonly used to prevent overfitting, including dropout and L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization technique used during training to prevent over-dependence on individual neurons. It works by randomly dropping out, or "turning off," a proportion of neurons in a layer during each training iteration. This helps to ensure that the model does not rely too heavily on any single neuron, improving its ability to generalize to new data.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is another common technique used to prevent overfitting. It works by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to keep its weights small, reducing the complexity of the model and helping to prevent overfitting.

While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, they are widely used in deep learning pipelines and are essential for preventing overfitting. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that they would be employed in the deep learning pipelines discussed in the provided sources.
