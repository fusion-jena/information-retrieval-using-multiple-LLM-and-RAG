Answer:::

The text provided does not give specific details about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does provide some context about the data preparation and model training that could be relevant.

First, the input data is 40-dimensional and undergoes batch normalization to account for differences in distribution between different batches of training data and between the training set and test set. The mean and variance of each channel in the current batch are calculated, and the input is normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. The normalized output is then multiplied by a scale parameter and a shift parameter is added to obtain the final output.

The deep learning model is based on artificial neural networks and is used to fit the drivers and mechanisms of land use cover change (LUCC). The drivers of LUCC include natural, socioeconomic, and political factors, with natural conditions controlling the basic trends and processes of overall LUCC and human activities and socioeconomic factors driving LUCC on a small spatiotemporal scale.

Water and settlements are constraint factors that can be determined by manual interpretation, and thus, no simulation is needed. The statistical data and the quantity simulated by the backtracking of the Markov model are combined to modify the numbers of different LU types in 2000.

Therefore, while the text provides information on the data preparation and model training, it does not give specific details about the deployment of the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection.
