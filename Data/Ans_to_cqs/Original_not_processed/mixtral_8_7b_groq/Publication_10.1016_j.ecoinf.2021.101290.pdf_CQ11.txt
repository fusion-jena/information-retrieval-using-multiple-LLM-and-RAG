Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no specific mention of a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The sources mention various tools, methods, and applications of deep learning, but they do not provide a link to a data repository.

However, there are several general-purpose data repositories that are often used for sharing datasets related to deep learning research. Some popular examples include:

1. Zenodo (<https://zenodo.org/>) - a research data repository that allows researchers to deposit datasets, software, and other research outputs.
2. Figshare (<https://figshare.com/>) - a platform for sharing and discovering research data, including datasets, figures, images, and videos.
3. Dryad (<https://datadryad.org/>) - a nonprofit repository for data underlying scientific and medical research.
4. GBIF (<https://www.gbif.org/>) - the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, which provides access to data about biodiversity from around the world.

These repositories allow researchers to share their data and make it available to other researchers, which can help to promote transparency, reproducibility, and collaboration in deep learning research. If you are looking for a specific dataset related to deep learning, it may be worth checking these repositories or contacting the authors of the relevant research papers to see if they have made their data available.
