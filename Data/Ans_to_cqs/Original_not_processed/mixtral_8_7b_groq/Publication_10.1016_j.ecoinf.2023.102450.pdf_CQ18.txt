Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of prediction error and cycle time in a Siamese network. The prediction error is the difference between the predicted and actual values, while the cycle time is the time taken to complete one training iteration.

In this case, the prediction error is calculated for each video, and the mean prediction error is obtained for each category of videos. For instance, the mean prediction error for videos 1-5 is 29.20 seconds, while for videos 6-10, it is 16.2 seconds. This error helps in evaluating the accuracy of the model during training.

Additionally, the cycle time is also monitored to ensure the efficiency of the training process. The cycle time is measured in seconds and represents the time taken for one iteration of the training process. For example, the cycle time for video 1 is 21.1 seconds, while for video 2, it is 23.03 seconds.

The use of few-shot learning in training the Siamese network is also a strategy to monitor the model performance. In few-shot learning, the training dataset contains a limited number of samples, making it easier to monitor the performance of the model. The classification task is defined as the N-way K-shot problem, where the training set contains N different categories with each category comprising K labeled samples.

The training of the tracking tasks is performed using two-way one-shot learning, where two categories are defined, namely target and non-target. Based on the training pairs assigned to the labels, experiments are conducted using two-way one-shot learning.

Moreover, the monitoring of the model performance during training is also done by evaluating the impact of interference. This involves the analysis of the performance of the model when subjected to external factors or disturbances. For instance, the study by Feng et al. (2021) on action recognition using a spatial-temporal network for wild felines evaluates the impact of interference on the model's performance.

Overall, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of prediction error, cycle time, few-shot learning, and evaluation of the impact of interference. These methods help in ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of the model during training.
