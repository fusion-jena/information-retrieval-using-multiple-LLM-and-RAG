The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that the study uses PyCharm software for semantic segmentation processing and graphics processing software for proofreading. It is possible that these software applications are running on a machine with a powerful GPU, which is common for deep learning tasks. Additionally, the use of HRNet, a high-resolution network model, suggests the need for substantial computational power. Therefore, it is likely that high-end GPUs or other specialized hardware, such as TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), are used to handle the computational requirements of the model. Nonetheless, the exact hardware resources remain unspecified in the given context.
