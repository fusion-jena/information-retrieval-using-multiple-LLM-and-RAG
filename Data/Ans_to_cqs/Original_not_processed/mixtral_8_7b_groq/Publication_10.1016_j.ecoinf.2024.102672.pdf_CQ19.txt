Answer:::
The provided context states that the data analysis was performed using open-source libraries and frameworks for the Python 3 programming language. Specifically, the libraries used include NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Shap. While the context does mention the use of machine learning and deep learning models, it does not explicitly specify which framework was used to build the deep learning model.

However, since Keras is one of the libraries used and it is a high-level neural networks API, capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was likely built using TensorFlow or one of the other supported backend frameworks.

It's worth noting that, Keras is a user-friendly, high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation, and it is particularly suited for individuals without a deep learning background.

Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the deep learning model was built using TensorFlow, as it is one of the most popular and widely-used deep learning frameworks, and it is supported by Keras.
