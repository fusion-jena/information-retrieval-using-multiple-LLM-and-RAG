Answer:::

In the context provided, the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. However, the text does mention the issue of overfitting in the context of choosing a suitable mini-batch size. Therefore, I will provide a general explanation of common regularization methods used in deep learning.

Regularization is a set of techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models, including deep learning. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization introduces a penalty on the complexity of the model to reduce overfitting.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are L2 regularization and dropout.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is the sum of the squares of all the model's weights multiplied by a regularization parameter. This penalty term discourages the model from learning overly large weights, which can lead to overfitting. During training, the model learns to balance the trade-off between minimizing the loss function and keeping the weights small.

Dropout is a technique that randomly sets a fraction of the model's outputs to zero during training. This prevents the model from relying too much on any single neuron, which can lead to overfitting. Dropout effectively creates an ensemble of models, where each model is a subnetwork of the original model, and the final prediction is the average of all the subnetworks' predictions.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline, L2 regularization and dropout are two common regularization techniques used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights, while dropout randomly sets a fraction of the model's outputs to zero during training to prevent overreliance on any single neuron.
