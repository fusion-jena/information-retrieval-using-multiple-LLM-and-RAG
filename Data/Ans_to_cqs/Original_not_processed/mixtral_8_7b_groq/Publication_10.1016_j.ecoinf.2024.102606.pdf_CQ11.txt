Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for Collembola identification using a new manually annotated dataset, specifically Yolov5x6. However, it does not mention where the data repository for this study is located. Therefore, I am unable to provide the link to the data repository.
