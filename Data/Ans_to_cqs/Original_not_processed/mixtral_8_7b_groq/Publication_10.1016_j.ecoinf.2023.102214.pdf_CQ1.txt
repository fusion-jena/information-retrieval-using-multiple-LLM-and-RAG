Answer:

The context provided does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the data used in the study involves snow leopard images, as the researchers aimed to contribute the largest fully labeled snow leopard dataset for deep learning research.

One possible source of data could be cameras or sensors placed in snow leopard habitats to capture images. This is suggested by the authors' mention of left-right mirroring data augmentation techniques, which implies that the original data includes images taken from different angles or orientations.

Additionally, the context indicates that the data was compiled in Whiskerbook.org, which could suggest that the data was collected from various sources, including existing datasets, research collaborations, or user submissions.

It is also possible that the data was collected through surveys or other forms of data collection from individuals who have encountered snow leopards in the wild. However, the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that the data includes snow leopard images from various sources, potentially including cameras or sensors in snow leopard habitats, existing datasets, research collaborations, user submissions, or surveys.
