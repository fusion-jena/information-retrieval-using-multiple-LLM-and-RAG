Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the training of a deep learning model. The study discusses the use of the Twitter API and the twarc2 library to handle and search for tweets, as well as the 'Full-archive search endpoint' to access the entire dataset published on Twitter. The study also mentions the potential benefits of using a deep learning model for training with a larger volume of data, but it does not specify the hardware resources used for this purpose. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
