Answer:::
In the given context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. The focus of the text is on the application of machine learning algorithms, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), in the context of water quality parameter prediction. The datasets used in this particular study are reservoir datasets, but the specific names or details of these datasets are not provided.

However, the text does mention some well-known datasets in the field of deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet, in the context of discussing the capabilities of deep learning models. For instance, it's mentioned that ANNs require copious amounts of data to train properly, and these datasets (MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet) are often used for training and evaluating deep learning models.

MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits, CIFAR is a collection of image datasets, and ImageNet is a large-scale image recognition dataset. These datasets are widely used in the deep learning community for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.
