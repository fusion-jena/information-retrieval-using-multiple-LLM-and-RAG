Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific method used to optimize the hyperparameters of a model, such as grid search or random search. The text focuses on the use of the Jenks natural breaks optimization method for dividing NDVI data into different classes.

However, it is important to note that hyperparameter optimization is a crucial step in the development of many machine learning models. Grid search and random search are two common methods used for this purpose. Grid search involves systematically trying out different combinations of hyperparameters within a specified range, while random search selects hyperparameters at random from a specified distribution.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention the specific method used to optimize the hyperparameters of a model, it is an important step in the development of many machine learning models. Grid search and random search are two common methods used for this purpose.
