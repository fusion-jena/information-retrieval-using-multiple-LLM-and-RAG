I don't have the exact link to the data repository for the deep learning pipeline, but based on the context provided, I can guide you on how to find it.

The text mentions a crawling tool used to gather data from different SRS products, which are stored in NetCDF files sourced from ESA or NASA. These files contain vital parameters such as reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), and Chl-a (AOT), among others. Although the text does not explicitly mention a deep learning pipeline, it does mention a repository.

To find the data repository, follow these steps:

1. Locate the repository's README.md file, as it is mentioned to be a valuable resource for understanding the operational intricacies of the tools. The README.md file might contain information about the data repository or how to access the data.
2. If the README.md file does not contain the required information, look for a 'Data' or 'Datasets' directory or section within the repository. This section should contain information about the data repository or a direct link to it.
3. If you still cannot find the data repository, consider looking at the papers, articles, or resources mentioned in the text. For instance, the text mentions a paper by J.G. GimÂ´enez et al. (EcologicalInformatics81(2024)1025544). You may find the required information in this paper or be able to contact the authors for more details.

In summary, while I cannot provide the exact data repository link for the deep learning pipeline, I can guide you on how to find it using the information provided in the context. Start by checking the README.md file, then look for a 'Data' or 'Datasets' section within the repository, and finally consult related papers or resources for more information.
