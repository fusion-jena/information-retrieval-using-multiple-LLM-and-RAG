The provided context does not include specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for water quality classification. However, it does mention that the AlexNet architecture is used in the study, which typically involves techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling to augment the dataset. These methods are commonly used to increase the size and diversity of the training set, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize.

Flipping refers to horizontally or vertically flipping images in the dataset. This helps the model learn features that are invariant to orientation. Rotating involves rotating images by certain degrees, which can help the model learn features that are invariant to orientation changes. Scaling involves changing the size of the images, which can help the model learn features that are invariant to scale changes.

In the study by Baek, Pyo, and Chun (2020), a CNN-LSTM combined deep learning approach is used for predicting water level and water quality. While the context does not explicitly mention data augmentation techniques, it is likely that such techniques were used to increase the robustness and generalization ability of their model.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for water quality classification, it is common practice to use techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling to augment the dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize.
