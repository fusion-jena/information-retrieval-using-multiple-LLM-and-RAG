The provided pieces of context do not contain specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for the study by Mohedano et al., 2017. However, some of the sources describe various data collection and processing methods that could be used in conjunction with data augmentation techniques.

Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to increase the size of the training dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize. These techniques create new synthetic samples by applying transformations to the existing data.

In the context of the Mohedano et al., 2017 study, the authors used deep convolutional neural networks for object retrieval. However, the specific data augmentation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline are not mentioned.

Other sources in the context describe various data collection and processing methods. For example, Dagan, 2006, provides information on archaeological survey data from the Israel Antiquities Authority (IAA) used for land use/land cover (LU/LC) analysis. Di Gregorio and Jansen, 2005, describe the Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) and its classification concepts. These sources could be used in conjunction with data augmentation techniques to improve the model's performance.

Therefore, while the provided context does not contain specific information about the data augmentation techniques used in the Mohedano et al., 2017 study, it is common practice to use data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling in deep learning pipelines to improve the model's ability to generalize.
