Answer:::
The provided context does not give information about where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The research paper mentions that the architecture used was a modified version of a Pytorch implementation by the GitHub user "eelxpeng," but it does not specify if the modified code was shared in a repository or what the repository's name is. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
