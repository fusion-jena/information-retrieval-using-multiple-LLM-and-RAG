Answer: The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP). Accuracy is the ratio of the total number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions made. Precision, on the other hand, is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions made. Recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances in the data. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which provides a single metric that encapsulates both precision and recall.

In addition to these metrics, mAP is also used to evaluate the performance of the model. mAP is a measure of accuracy for a machine learning algorithm that takes into account the ranking of the predicted instances. It is calculated as the average of the precision values at different recall levels.

These metrics are calculated using the equations provided in the context, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and mAP. The accuracy is calculated as the sum of true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN) divided by the sum of TP, TN, false positives (FP), and false negatives (FN). Precision is calculated as TP divided by the sum of TP and FP, while recall is calculated as TP divided by the sum of TP and FN. The F1 score is calculated as twice the product of precision and recall divided by the sum of precision and recall.

mAP is calculated as the sum of the product of the precision and the change in recall between two consecutive recall levels, divided by the number of recall levels. The average mAP is then calculated as the average of the mAP values for all classes in the data.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model for different epoch values, as shown in Table 8. The table provides the average computation time for preprocessing, inference, and non-maximum suppression (NMS), as well as the accuracy for different epoch values. The trends of mAP values with increasing epochs are also shown in Figs. 14 and 15.

In summary, the performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and mAP. These metrics are calculated using the equations provided in the context and are used to evaluate the model for different epoch values. The mAP metric is particularly useful for evaluating the performance of the model in terms of ranking the predicted instances.
