Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The sources mention the use of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for semantic segmentation of wildfire fuel types, and they provide metrics for the performance of the model, but they do not describe the process of hyperparameter tuning.

Hyperparameter tuning is an important step in training machine learning models, as it can have a significant impact on the model's performance. There are several common methods for hyperparameter tuning, including grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves systematically trying all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a specified range, while random search involves randomly selecting hyperparameters to try within a specified range. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic model to guide the search for the best hyperparameters.

Without more information, it is not possible to say for certain how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized in this case. It is possible that the authors used one of the methods mentioned above, or they may have used a different method entirely.

In summary, based on the provided context, there is no information given about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. It is possible that the authors used a method such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization, but this is not specified in the given text.
