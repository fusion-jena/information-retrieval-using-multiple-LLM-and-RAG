Answer:

The deep learning pipeline used in the study to classify fish from different families utilizes DNA barcode sequences as the primary data format. Before feeding the data into the deep learning model, the DNA sequences undergo a series of preprocessing steps.

First, the DNA sequences are aligned to obtain sequences with the same length. This alignment process is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the data and ensuring that the model can learn meaningful patterns from the sequences.

Next, the aligned DNA sequences are converted into numerical data using one-hot encoding. One-hot encoding is a technique used to represent categorical data as numerical data, where each unique category is represented by a binary vector. In this case, the DNA sequences are converted into binary vectors, where each vector represents a specific nucleotide (A, T, C, or G) at a particular position in the sequence.

Once the DNA sequences are converted into numerical data, they are fed into the deep learning model. The model uses Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) to learn the features of the data and obtain an outgroup score for each object. The EN-SAE model is a type of deep learning model that is well-suited for learning features from high-dimensional data, such as DNA sequences.

Finally, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is used to generate a threshold and predict which fish are outgroups based on the threshold. KDE is a non-parametric method used to estimate the probability density function of a dataset. In this case, KDE is used to estimate the probability density function of the outgroup scores and automatically learn the decision threshold.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline used in the study to classify fish from different families utilizes DNA barcode sequences as the primary data format. The DNA sequences are preprocessed by aligning them and converting them into numerical data using one-hot encoding. The EN-SAE model is then used to learn the features of the data and obtain outgroup scores for each object. Finally, KDE is used to generate a threshold and predict which fish are outgroups based on the threshold.
