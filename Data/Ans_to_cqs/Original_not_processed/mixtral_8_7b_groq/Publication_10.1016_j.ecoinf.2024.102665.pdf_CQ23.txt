Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the use of a deep learning model. The text focuses on a study that used a method called MWST (Maximum Weight Spanning Tree) to analyze data on fish factors (FF) and other variables in coral reef communities. The MWST method was used to create a network that summarizes information on the coral reef community from the measured variables across taxa. This network includes all factor nodes and observable nodes from monitoring data. The study also used multiple clustering to create a hierarchical clustering network that summarizes information on the coral reef community from the measured variables across taxa.

However, the provided context does not mention any measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to answer the query about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.
