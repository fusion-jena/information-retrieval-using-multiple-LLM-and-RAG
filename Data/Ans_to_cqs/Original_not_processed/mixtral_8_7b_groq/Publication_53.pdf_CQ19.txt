Answer:::

The deep learning model was built using Python and the fastai library. The specific framework or library for building the model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, is not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot give a specific answer to this question. However, we know that the model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) and that it was trained on high-definition satellite images to detect farm dams in Australia.
