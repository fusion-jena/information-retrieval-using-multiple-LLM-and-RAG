Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Sentinel-2 satellite data in the study.

In the context, it is stated that the study area's land use classes are represented by the data collected in Table 3, and an overview of the plot locations is presented in Fig. 4. Additionally, the abstract mentions the use of Earth observation and remote sensing techniques.

Therefore, it can be inferred that remote sensing data, specifically from the Sentinel-2 satellite, is used as the primary source of raw data in this deep learning pipeline. Remote sensing involves the use of sensors on satellites or aircraft to measure reflected or emitted radiation from the Earth's surface.

Furthermore, the reference to the Otsu (1979) method suggests that image thresholding is used to segment the remote sensing data into different land use classes. The Padial-Iglesias et al. (2021) reference indicates that filtering rules are applied to the ground truth samples to achieve higher accuracy in land cover maps.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data, it can be inferred that remote sensing data from the Sentinel-2 satellite is used, and image processing techniques such as thresholding and filtering are applied to the data to extract meaningful information.

Answer::: 

In summary, the primary source of raw data in this deep learning pipeline is remote sensing data from the Sentinel-2 satellite. Image processing techniques such as thresholding and filtering are applied to the data to extract meaningful information. However, the context does not provide specific details about other methods used for collecting raw data, such as surveys or public datasets.
