Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The sources mainly focus on the methodology, results, and applications of deep learning techniques for image classification and wildlife survey, but they do not mention a data repository link. It is possible that the authors did not share the dataset publicly or it is not available through a Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF repository. If you are interested in the dataset, I would recommend contacting the authors directly for more information.
