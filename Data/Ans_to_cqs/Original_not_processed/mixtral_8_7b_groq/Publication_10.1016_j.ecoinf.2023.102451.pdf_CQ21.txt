Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about postprocessing steps performed immediately after model training, such as generating saliency maps or creating confusion matrices. However, it is mentioned that the performance of the proposed EMViT-Net model is evaluated on unseen test sets of the datasets by calculating performance metrics accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.

Here's a summary of the evaluation process mentioned in the context:

1. Preprocessed images are fed to the transformer-based network EMViT-Net for extracting local and global features of microbes from EM images.
2. The integration of the SCPSA block in the CNN module of the EMViT-Net makes the model more efficient in extracting depth-wise features from the images.
3. The extracted features are then given to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) module for final feature fusion and classification.
4. Finally, the performance of the proposed EMViT-Net is evaluated on unseen test sets of the datasets by calculating performance metrics accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score.

Given this information, it can be inferred that metrics calculation is a part of the postprocessing steps after model training. However, there is no information about other common postprocessing steps like generating saliency maps or creating confusion matrices.
