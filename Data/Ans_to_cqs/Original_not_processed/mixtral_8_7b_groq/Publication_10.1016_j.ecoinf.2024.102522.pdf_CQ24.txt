The provided context does not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines. However, it does describe a logistic regression model used to predict the risk probability of Hyphantria cunea spreading transmission in a given spatial scale, which can involve handling randomness in a statistical modeling context.

In statistical modeling, including logistic regression, randomness can be handled through various strategies, some of which can be adapted to deep learning pipelines. Here are some common strategies to handle randomness:

1. **Random seed value**: A random seed value is used to initialize the random number generator, ensuring that the same sequence of random numbers is generated each time the model is run. This helps in reproducing the results and ensuring that the randomness introduced during the training process is controlled.

2. **Data splitting**: To evaluate the model's performance, the dataset is often split into training, validation, and testing sets. This process can be randomized to ensure that each subset contains a representative sample of the data.

3. **Regularization**: Techniques like L1 and L2 regularization are used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, reducing the impact of individual random fluctuations in the data.

4. **Cross-validation**: To further reduce the impact of randomness in data splitting, cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation can be used. This involves dividing the data into k subsets, training the model k times, and averaging the performance metrics.

5. **Bootstrapping**: Bootstrapping is a resampling technique that involves creating new datasets by randomly sampling the original dataset with replacement. This can help assess the variability of the model's performance and improve the estimation of model parameters.

While these strategies are primarily discussed in the context of statistical modeling, they can be adapted and applied to deep learning pipelines to handle randomness and improve model performance.
