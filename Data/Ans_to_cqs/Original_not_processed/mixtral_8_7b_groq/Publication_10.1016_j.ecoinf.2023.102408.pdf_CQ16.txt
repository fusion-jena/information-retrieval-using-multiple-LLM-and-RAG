Answer:::

The context does not provide explicit information about the specific criterion used to determine when training is complete. However, it can be inferred that the training process might have been determined by a validation loss plateau or a similar condition.

In the context, a stratified sampling method was used to split the data into a training dataset (70%) and a validation dataset (30%). This allowed for the evaluation of model performance, particularly when dealing with less important variables. Three error statistics, R2, mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE), were employed to compare the accuracies of the models. It can be reasonably assumed that the training process was determined by monitoring the performance on the validation dataset, and the training was stopped when the validation loss (e.g., RMSE) plateaued or showed minimal improvement over a certain number of iterations.

Additionally, when discussing the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, the study mentioned systematically evaluating the 'mtry' parameter from 1 to 10 to find a balance between stability and minimizing the RMSE. This process also implies monitoring the model's performance during training to make adjustments and fine-tune the model's hyperparameters.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly state the criterion used to determine when training is complete, it can be inferred that the training process was likely determined by a validation loss plateau or a similar condition, as the study involved monitoring model performance on a validation dataset and adjusting hyperparameters to minimize the RMSE.
