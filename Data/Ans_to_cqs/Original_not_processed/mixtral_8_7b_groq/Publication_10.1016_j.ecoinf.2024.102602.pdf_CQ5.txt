Answer:::

The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not directly mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the models were trained and tested on digital images of the invasive alien plant species Cortaderia selloana, also known as pampas grass, in the context of monitoring its occurrence in Portugal.

The images were resized to a uniform resolution of 227x197 pixels and normalized to the [0,1] range before being fed into six open-source Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0. These models were chosen for their ease of transfer learning and high performance on similar classification tasks.

It is not explicitly stated whether these images were sourced from a pre-existing dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, or if they were collected specifically for this study. Nonetheless, the context provides enough information to deduce that the research involved creating a custom dataset of digital images featuring the target plant species.
