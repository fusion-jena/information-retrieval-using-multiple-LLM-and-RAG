The provided context discusses an experiment involving WT-HMM (Waveform Transformation Hidden Markov Model) with varying dataset sizes, but it does not directly mention strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines such as setting a random seed value. However, the text does touch upon the general concept of randomness in machine learning models and its impact on model performance.

In machine learning, randomness can be introduced in various ways, such as random initialization of weights in artificial neural networks (ANNs) or random sampling during training. To account for this variability, the authors performed experiments over different runs. This approach helps capture the range of outcomes produced by the random factors, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the model's behavior.

In deep learning pipelines, a common strategy for handling randomness is setting a fixed random seed value. By doing so, the random number generator used in the pipeline produces the same sequence of random numbers in every run, ensuring consistent and reproducible results. This is particularly important for scientific research and model development, where reproducibility is crucial.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, it does discuss the importance of accounting for randomness in machine learning models. In general, setting a fixed random seed value is a common strategy for ensuring reproducibility in deep learning pipelines.
