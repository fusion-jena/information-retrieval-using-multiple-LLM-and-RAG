Answer:::
The provided context does not give detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the algorithms were implemented in Pytorch and models were trained and tested in Google Colaboratory. This suggests that the models were likely trained and tested in a cloud-based environment.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a min-max scaler, which is a technique used for data preprocessing. This implies that some form of model serialization was used, as the scaler would need to be applied to new data in the same way it was applied to the training data.

However, the context does not provide information on other important aspects of model deployment, such as how the model was integrated into a larger system, how it was served to end-users, or how its performance was monitored and managed over time.

In summary, while the context provides some information on the tools and techniques used to train and test the deep learning model, it does not provide a complete picture of the model deployment process.
