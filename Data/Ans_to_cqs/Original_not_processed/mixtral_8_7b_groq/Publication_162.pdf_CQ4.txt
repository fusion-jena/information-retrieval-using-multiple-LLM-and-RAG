Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling that were applied in the described deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the architecture of D-Mask R-CNN, which is used for fauna and flora detection, and the normalization process applied to the input channels. It also explains the feature fusion module and the evaluation of the model on instances of deers.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to use data augmentation techniques to increase the size and variability of the training set, improve model performance, and reduce overfitting. Some of these techniques include:

1. Flipping: Horizontal or vertical mirroring of the images.
2. Rotating: Rotating the images by a certain angle.
3. Scaling: Changing the size of the images, usually by randomly zooming in or out.
4. Translation: Shifting the images horizontally or vertically.
5. Color jittering: Changing the brightness, contrast, saturation, or hue of the images.

These techniques can be applied on-the-fly during training, meaning that random transformations are applied to the images as they are fed into the model. This results in a much larger and more diverse training set, as each image can be transformed multiple times.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is common practice to use techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, translation, and color jittering to improve model performance and reduce overfitting.
