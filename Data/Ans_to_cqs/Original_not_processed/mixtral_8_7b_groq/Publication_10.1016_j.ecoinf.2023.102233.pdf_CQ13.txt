Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs. Specifically, a batch size of 64, ten epochs, and a learning rate of 0.001 were used during the active learning iterations. However, the optimizer used in the model is not specified in the given context.

Moreover, the hyperparameters were tuned using a grid search technique, which is a type of exhaustive search that attempts to find the best combination of hyperparameters by iterating over a manually specified subset of possible values for each hyperparameter. This technique was applied to the final model, including the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate.

Another important aspect of the model development is the active learning framework, which was used to iteratively train and improve the CNN model. The active learning approach allowed for the addition of training data in a strategic manner, where the majority of model performance improvement was achieved within the first two iterations.

In summary, the deep learning model used a batch size of 64, ten epochs, and a learning rate of 0.001, and these hyperparameters were tuned using a grid search technique. However, the optimizer used in the model is not specified in the given context.
