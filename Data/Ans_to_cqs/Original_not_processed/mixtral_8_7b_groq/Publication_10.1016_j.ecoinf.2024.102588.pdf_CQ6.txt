Answer:::

The provided context discusses the training of deep learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and an autoencoder, but it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps applied to the data before training. However, based on common practices in deep learning, it is possible to infer some of the preprocessing steps that might have been involved.

Normalization and scaling are common preprocessing steps in deep learning. Normalization is the process of rescaling numeric data to a range of [0,1] or by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. Scaling, on the other hand, involves rescaling features to have a similar range of values, which can help the model converge faster during training. In the context provided, batch normalization is used as a layer within the CNN model. Batch normalization normalizes the activations of the previous layer at each batch, which can help the model generalize better and train faster. However, batch normalization is applied during training and not necessarily a preprocessing step for the entire dataset.

Cleaning refers to the process of handling missing values, outliers, and incorrect data points in the dataset. While the context does not explicitly mention data cleaning, it is a crucial step in preparing data for any machine learning algorithm. Data cleaning can involve removing missing values, imputing missing data, or transforming data to handle outliers.

The context also discusses the use of an autoencoder, which is an unsupervised learning algorithm that consists of an encoder and a decoder network. During training, the encoder compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional latent space, while the decoder reconstructs the original input data from this compressed representation. This process can be seen as a form of dimensionality reduction, which is another preprocessing step commonly used in deep learning.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning models, it is possible to infer that normalization, scaling, cleaning, and dimensionality reduction were likely applied to the data before training.
