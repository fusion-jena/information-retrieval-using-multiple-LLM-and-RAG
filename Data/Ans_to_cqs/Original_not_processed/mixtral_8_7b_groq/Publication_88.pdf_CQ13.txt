Answer:::

The deep learning model used in the study employs the EF network architecture, which consists of three convolutional layers, two max-pooling layers, and two fully connected layers, followed by a softmax layer with two outputs corresponding to "deforestation" and "no-deforestation" classes. The hyperparameters used in this model include a batch size of 32, 100 number of epochs, early stopping after 10 epochs with no improvement over the validation set, a dropout rate of 0.2 in the final FC layer, and the Adam optimizer with a weight decay of 0.9 and a learning rate of 1e-3. The binary cross-entropy is used as the loss function. Additionally, the buffer of both references was obtained using a morphological dilation with a disk of radius 2, followed by a difference between the dilated and original images, and patches with the central pixel in these regions were not considered for training, validation, or testing.
