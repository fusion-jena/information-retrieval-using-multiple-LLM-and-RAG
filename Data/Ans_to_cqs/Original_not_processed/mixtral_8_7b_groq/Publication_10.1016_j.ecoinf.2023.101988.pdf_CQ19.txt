The provided context does not contain specific information about the framework used to build the deep learning model for animal biodiversity modeling using acoustic monitoring. The paper by Chalmers et al., 2021, mentions the use of deep learning for animal biodiversity modeling, but it does not specify the framework used.

However, it is worth noting that TensorFlow and PyTorch are two of the most commonly used frameworks for building deep learning models. TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google Brain Team, while PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. Both frameworks provide extensive functionalities for building and training deep learning models, and they are widely used in research and industry.

Therefore, while the provided context does not specify the framework used for building the deep learning model for animal biodiversity modeling, it is likely that either TensorFlow or PyTorch was used, as they are the most popular frameworks for deep learning.
