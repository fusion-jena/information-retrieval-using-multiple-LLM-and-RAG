Answer:::

The provided pieces of context do not include information about a deep learning pipeline or any code repository links related to it. The context mainly discusses the use of Wikiloc as a data source for Caller Experience Studies (CES) and the use of Word2vec for semantic analysis of textual data from Wikiloc. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested link to the deep learning pipeline.
