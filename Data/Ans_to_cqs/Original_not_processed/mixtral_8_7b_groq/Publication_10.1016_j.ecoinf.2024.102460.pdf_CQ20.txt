The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of the LSTM model, a type of deep learning model, for solving time series data prediction problems. However, it does not specify the hardware used for training this model.

Deep learning models like LSTM often require significant computational resources for training, and graphics processing units (GPUs) or tensor processing units (TPUs) are commonly used to accelerate the training process. GPUs and TPUs are specialized hardware designed to handle parallel computations, which are essential for deep learning models.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of GPUs or TPUs for training the LSTM model, it is reasonable to assume that such hardware resources were used to accelerate the training process. However, without further information, this remains a assumption.
