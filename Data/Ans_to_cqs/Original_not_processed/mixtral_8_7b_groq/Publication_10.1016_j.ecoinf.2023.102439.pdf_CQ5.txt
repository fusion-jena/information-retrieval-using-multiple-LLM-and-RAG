The provided context does not include information about deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in the context of land use and land cover (LULC) change detection and vegetation biomass density prediction.

In the study by Al-Dousari, A.E., Mishra, A., and Singh, S. (2023), a multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) was used to detect LULC change in the Kuwait metropolitan region. The study used Landsat data from 1984 to 2018, which was preprocessed and then used to train and test the MLPNN model.

Another study by Alshari, E.A., Abdulkareem, M.B., and Gawali, B.W. (2023) used an artificial neural network (ANN) combined with a random forest (RF) model for land use/land cover classification. The study used Sentinel-2 data from 2019 to 2020 and obtained an overall accuracy of 92.5%.

Therefore, while the context does not provide information on deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, it does mention the use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in the context of remote sensing and LULC change detection. The datasets used in these studies include Landsat and Sentinel-2 data.
