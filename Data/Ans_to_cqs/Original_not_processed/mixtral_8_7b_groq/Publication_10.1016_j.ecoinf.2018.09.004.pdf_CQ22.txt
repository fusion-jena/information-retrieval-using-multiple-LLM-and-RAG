Answer:::

The provided context discusses various metrics used to evaluate the performance of a model, but it does not explicitly mention the evaluation of a deep learning model. However, I will provide an answer based on the given information, assuming that the deep learning model in question is a binary classifier.

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of a binary classifier include accuracy, precision, recall, and the F-measure.

Accuracy is a common metric for evaluating a model's performance. It is defined as the ratio of the correctly classified instances to the total number of instances. In the context of binary classification, accuracy can be calculated using the counts TP, TN, FP, and FN, as shown in equation (1).

Precision is the fraction of relevant/correct instances among the retrieved instances for a class. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false positives (FP), as shown in equation (2).

Recall is the fraction of relevant instances that have been retrieved over the total amount of relevant instances. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN), as shown in equation (2).

The F-measure score is the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. It is calculated as shown in equation (3), which balances the contributions of Precision and Recall.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of a binary classifier, but the context does not explicitly mention deep learning models. However, these metrics can be applied to deep learning models as well, provided that they are used for binary classification tasks.

In summary, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a binary classifier, including deep learning models, are accuracy, precision, recall, and the F-measure. These metrics are used to assess the model's ability to correctly classify instances and balance the contributions of precision and recall.
