Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model. The text discusses the use of historical imagery and manual classification methods, as well as potential improvements through the use of machine learning and spectral libraries. However, it does not mention any specific metrics for evaluating the performance of a deep learning model.

In general, when evaluating the performance of a deep learning model for image classification tasks, metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are commonly used. Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified images out of the total number of images. Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and provides a balanced measure of both.

Therefore, while the specific metrics used for evaluating the deep learning model are not mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are potential candidates for such evaluation metrics.
