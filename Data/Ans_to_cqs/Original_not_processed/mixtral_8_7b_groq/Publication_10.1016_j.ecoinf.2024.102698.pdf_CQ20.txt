Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that convolutional neural networks (CNN), auto encoders, and generative adversarial networks (GAN) are used, which are types of deep learning models. These models can be computationally expensive and require significant computational power to train.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of a generator and a discriminator, as mentioned in the context. Training such a model involves backpropagating the error from the discriminator to the generator, which requires a high-performance computing device such as a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) or a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU).

Moreover, the context mentions that synthetic connectivity data was generated using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model based on the y-data-synthetic Python package. This suggests that the training of the GAN model was done on a computing device that supports Python packages.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning models mentioned in the context were likely trained on hardware resources such as GPUs or TPUs, which are commonly used for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel computations efficiently. However, the specific hardware resources used are not explicitly mentioned in the context.
