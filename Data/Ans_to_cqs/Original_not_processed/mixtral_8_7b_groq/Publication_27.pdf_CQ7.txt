Answer:::

The criteria used to split data for deep learning model training typically include train, test, and validation sets. The purpose of splitting the data is to evaluate the model's performance, avoid overfitting, and ensure that the model can generalize well to unseen data.

The train set is used to train the deep learning model. It is the largest portion of the data, typically consisting of 60-80% of the total dataset. The model learns patterns and features from the train set to make predictions.

The test set is used to evaluate the model's performance after training. It is the second-largest portion of the data, typically consisting of 10-20% of the total dataset. The model makes predictions on the test set, and the predictions are compared to the actual values to calculate the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics.

The validation set is used during the training process to tune the model's hyperparameters and prevent overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model learns the train set too well, including its noise and outliers, and performs poorly on new data. The validation set is a smaller portion of the data, typically consisting of 5-10% of the total dataset. The model's performance on the validation set is monitored during training, and if the performance starts to degrade, the training process is stopped to avoid overfitting.

The criteria used to split the data can vary depending on the specific deep learning application and the size and quality of the data. Common approaches include random sampling, stratified sampling, and k-fold cross-validation. Random sampling involves randomly selecting data points for each set. Stratified sampling involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain features, such as age or gender, and then randomly selecting data points from each subgroup. K-fold cross-validation involves dividing the data into k subgroups, training the model on k-1 subgroups, and testing the model on the remaining subgroup. This process is repeated k times, with a different subgroup used for testing each time.

In summary, the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training include train, test, and validation sets. The train set is used for training, the test set is used for evaluation, and the validation set is used for hyperparameter tuning and preventing overfitting. Common approaches for splitting the data include random sampling, stratified sampling, and k-fold cross-validation.
