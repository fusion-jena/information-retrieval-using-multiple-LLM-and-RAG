Answer:::

The generalizability of the deep learning model was addressed through several measures. Firstly, the creation of a diverse dataset was ensured by collecting 59,441 samples from ten of the most profitable and endangered species in the Peruvian Amazon Forestry. The dataset was acquired using six different commercial cameras to ensure variability and develop a flexible solution for real-world conditions.

Secondly, the data distribution was set to 70.12% for training, 1.69% for validation, and 28.19% for testing, which allowed for a sufficient amount of data for training while also reserving a portion for validation and testing.

Thirdly, the use of pre-trained models, specifically AlexNet, VGG-19, ResNet-101, and DenseNet-201, helped in capturing low-level features from one domain and transferring them to another with similar characteristics. This process, called fine-tuning, allowed the model to learn specific higher-level features while leveraging the knowledge gained from the ImageNet dataset.

Lastly, the evaluation of the model's performance was conducted by swapping the testing sets (source â†’ target) and comparing the accuracy. This method, as described in Table 5, provided a better understanding of how well the model generalized to new data.

Therefore, the creation of a diverse dataset, the appropriate distribution of data for training, validation, and testing, the use of pre-trained models, and the evaluation of the model's performance through swapping testing sets were the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
