Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the models being compared. However, it does mention that a training loss curve is shown in Figure 3, which compares the training loss function gradient vs. iteration curve for Basic UNet (Model-1) and UNet with EfficientNet-B5 feature extractor architecture (Model-2). This suggests that the training process for these models involves monitoring the training loss over iterations.

In general, monitoring the training loss over iterations is a common approach to determine when training is complete. Specifically, if the training loss plateaus or starts to increase, it may indicate that the model has learned the training data sufficiently and further training may not improve the model's performance. Additionally, monitoring the validation loss over iterations can also be used to determine when training is complete. If the validation loss starts to increase while the training loss continues to decrease, it may indicate that the model is overfitting to the training data.

In the context of the models being compared, it is possible that the training process involved monitoring the training and validation loss over iterations and determining when training is complete based on these losses. However, without more specific information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
