Answer:::

The pieces of context provided do not contain specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline of the study by Dehghani et al., 2023. However, based on the general practices and common data formats used in deep learning, we can infer that the study likely used CSV or similar structured data formats for their hourly short-term streamflow forecasting task.

Deep learning models, such as LSTM, CNN, and ConvLSTM, can handle various data formats, including images, audio, video, and structured data formats like CSV. For time series forecasting tasks, such as the one in the study by Dehghani et al., 2023, structured data formats like CSV are commonly used. These formats typically contain historical data points collected at regular intervals, which the deep learning models use to learn patterns and make predictions.

In summary, while the specific data formats used in the study by Dehghani et al., 2023 are not provided, it is reasonable to infer that they used a structured data format like CSV for their hourly short-term streamflow forecasting task.
