Answer:

To monitor the model performance during training, the findings suggest that several strategies were implemented. Firstly, a total of 12 model configurations were tested, with varying optimizers, learning rates, and the inclusion or exclusion of dropout (Tables 3 and 4). This allowed for a comprehensive comparison of model performance based on different hyperparameters.

Secondly, the performance of each configuration was evaluated using multiple metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC score (Tables 4, 5, and 6). These metrics provided a well-rounded assessment of how each model was performing, taking into account various aspects such as the proportion of true positive predictions, the proportion of true negatives, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.

Thirdly, the performance of Model 1 was specifically monitored throughout each running fold of the model training for binary classification (Figs. 10 and 11). This allowed for the observation of how the model's performance fluctuated throughout the training process, providing insights into the model's stability and ability to generalize.

Lastly, the optimal Fast Fourier Transform window length was identified as 1024, which was used consistently throughout the training process (mentioned towards the end of the provided context). This suggests that a consistent window length was used to preprocess the input data, ensuring that the model's performance was not affected by varying window lengths during training.

In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involved testing various model configurations, evaluating performance using multiple metrics, monitoring the performance of a specific model throughout each running fold, and using a consistent window length for data preprocessing.
