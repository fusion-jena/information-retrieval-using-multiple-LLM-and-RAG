Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. The text focuses on the development and testing of a modified YOLOv8 model for detecting and counting non-beneficial soil-borne organisms (NBSB) in soybean fields using drone-acquired images and videos. However, it does not mention which platform was used to deploy the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
