Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, as well as the generation of a confusion matrix. These evaluations are presented in Figure 4, with a particular focus on the performance of the model using 21 selected pixels.

In addition to the metrics calculation, the context does not explicitly mention the use of saliency maps. However, it does mention the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model architecture for water quality level classification. A common practice in CNN-based models is to utilize saliency maps to visualize and understand the critical features that the model is using for its predictions. Although not explicitly stated, it is plausible that saliency maps were used during the postprocessing phase to gain insights into the important features driving the model's decisions.

To summarize, the postprocessing steps after model training in this water quality level classification task include:

1. Metrics calculation: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were computed to evaluate the model's performance.
2. Confusion matrix generation: A confusion matrix was created to provide a more detailed breakdown of the model's performance, particularly in terms of correct and incorrect classifications.
3. Saliency maps (potentially): Although not explicitly mentioned, the use of saliency maps is a common practice in CNN-based models to visualize and understand the important features driving the model's predictions.
