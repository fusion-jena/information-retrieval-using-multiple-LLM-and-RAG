Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The text mainly discusses the importance of studying the relationship between valve gape and environmental variables in the context of aquaculture.

However, it is worth noting that when it comes to training deep learning models, optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its variants, such as Adam, are commonly used. These optimization algorithms are used to minimize the loss function and find the optimal set of weights and biases for the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention any specific optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, it is reasonable to assume that standard optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam would be used, as they are widely used in the field of deep learning.
