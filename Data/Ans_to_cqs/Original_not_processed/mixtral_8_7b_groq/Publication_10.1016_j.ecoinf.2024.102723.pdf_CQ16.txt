Answer:::

The training process in the given context is controlled through an early stopping criterion based on the Mean Squared Error (MSE). However, the specific details about what exactly constitutes the "completion" of training, such as a validation loss plateau or a certain number of epochs, are not provided in the context.

The MSE is used as a reference metric to evaluate the performance of the models. To ensure a reliable estimate of the MSE on the test set, a 10-fold Cross Validation is performed. Each evaluation of the model predicts the output per test point through 1000 runs, due to the probabilistic nature of the models. This approach guarantees a robust estimation process with a 95% confidence interval and a precision level of 5%.

The context also discusses two methods for prediction, MCD and VBI, and compares their performance in terms of MSE and Normalized Mean Prediction Interval Width (NMPIW). However, it does not mention how these methods are used to determine the completion of training.

Therefore, while we know that MSE is used as a reference metric and that some form of cross-validation and model evaluation is being performed, the specific criterion for determining the completion of training is not provided in the context.
