Based on the provided context, there is no information about which frameworks are used to build deep learning models. The context includes several studies and papers related to sustainable growing mediums, source-sink relationships in crop plants, wind mechanisms, land use and land cover studies, soil sampling and analysis, and native vegetation in a specific region. However, none of these studies or papers mention or discuss deep learning model frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
