The provided context discusses the importance of data processing and classification methods in high-resolution remote sensing data analysis using deep learning. It highlights the impact of training sample representativeness, quantity, and optimization on the classification model's accuracy. However, it does not explicitly mention specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline.

Common techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This method involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific class distributions before splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets. This ensures that each subset has a similar distribution of classes, reducing bias and improving model performance.

2. Oversampling: In cases where certain classes are underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from these classes. This can help balance the dataset and reduce bias. However, oversampling can lead to overfitting if not done carefully.

3. Undersampling: Alternatively, undersampling can be used to decrease the number of instances from overrepresented classes, balancing the dataset and reducing bias. However, this method can result in the loss of valuable information.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting diverse data that represent various scenarios, conditions, and class distributions can help reduce bias in the dataset. This can involve gathering data from different sources, locations, or times to ensure a comprehensive and unbiased dataset.

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that feature optimization tools were employed to address the challenges of training sample representativeness and quantity. However, specific techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline were not mentioned.

In summary, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be used to address data bias during preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline. However, the provided context does not explicitly mention these techniques in relation to the study discussed.
