Answer:::
The context provided does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the models. However, it is common in machine learning tasks to use a validation dataset to monitor the performance of the model during training and stop training when the performance on the validation dataset stops improving or starts to degrade, which is often indicated by a plateau in the validation loss. This method is called early stopping and is used to prevent overfitting. Additionally, other convergence criteria such as a maximum number of epochs or a minimum change in the loss function may also be used. It is possible that one or more of these methods were used in the training of the models in the study, but without further information, a definitive answer cannot be given.
