Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only generally refers to "machine learning methods" and "machine learning tools" for image classification. More specifically, it mentions "human in the loop" classification and the potential use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for classification. However, it does not specify any particular deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to accurately answer this query.
