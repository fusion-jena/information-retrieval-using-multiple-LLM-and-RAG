Answer:::
The provided context does not give information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The first reference talks about a deep learning approach to species distribution modeling, but it does not specify where the model was deployed. The other references discuss various topics related to biodiversity monitoring and machine learning models, but none of them mention the platform used for deployment. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
