Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about which deep learning frameworks were used to build the model. Deep learning frameworks are tools that provide a convenient way for developers to build, train, and implement deep learning models. Some popular deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Caffe. These frameworks provide pre-built components and functions that make it easier to design and implement complex neural network architectures. Without additional information, it is not possible to determine which of these or other deep learning frameworks were used in the described study.
