Answer:::

The deep learning models in question were built using three different frameworks: Hugging Face, Keras, and PyTorch.

The Hugging Face framework was used to implement the Vision Transformer (ViT) model. The implementation used is "google/vit-hugepatch14â€“224-in21k". Hugging Face is a popular open-source library for natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning. It provides pre-trained models and tools for various NLP and computer vision tasks.

The Keras framework was used to implement the Inception-V3 model. Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation, supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, and runs on CPUs and GPUs.

The PyTorch framework was used to implement the ResNet-50 model. PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. It is primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab.

In summary, the deep learning models in question were built using Hugging Face for ViT, Keras for Inception-V3, and PyTorch for ResNet-50.
