Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific details about how the raw data was collected for the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the raw training dataset consisted of 20 fish species and a certain number of thumbnails for each species (Table S1). The first training dataset T1 contained raw fish thumbnails and their respective mirror images. It is possible that the raw data was collected through underwater photography or video recordings, but the context does not explicitly state this. Therefore, the specific methods used for collecting the raw data in this deep learning pipeline are not known based on the given information.
