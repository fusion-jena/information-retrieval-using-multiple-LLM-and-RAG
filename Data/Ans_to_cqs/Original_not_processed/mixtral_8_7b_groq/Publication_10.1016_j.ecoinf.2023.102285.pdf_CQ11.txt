I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about a data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The references and figures mainly discuss methodologies for detecting and classifying man-made underwater objects, bird surveys, human activity types, and ecological informatics. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested link.
