Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, some of the common data augmentation techniques used in image classification tasks include flipping, rotating, and scaling.

Flipping involves creating new images by flipping the original image horizontally or vertically. This technique helps the model to learn symmetrical features of the objects in the image.

Rotating involves creating new images by rotating the original image by a certain angle. This technique helps the model to learn the features of the objects in the image invariant to rotation.

Scaling involves creating new images by scaling the original image up or down. This technique helps the model to learn the features of the objects in the image invariant to scale.

In the context of Wang et al. (2020b), they used a deep convolutional neural network for common pests image recognition. They split the data into training, validation, and test sets and tiled the sticky plate images by finding regions of interest of a fixed size (512x512 pixels) that contain the maximum number of complete bounding boxes. However, they did not mention any data augmentation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline.

In the context of Wang et al. (2020a), they obtained a mean Average Precision (mAP) score of 63.54% using YOLOv3 while detecting and classifying pest species from the images in their "Pest24" dataset. The dataset consisted of 25,378 annotated images coming from 24 pest species that were all collected by an automatic imaging trap. However, they did not mention any data augmentation techniques used in their deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, some of the common data augmentation techniques used in image classification tasks include flipping, rotating, and scaling.
