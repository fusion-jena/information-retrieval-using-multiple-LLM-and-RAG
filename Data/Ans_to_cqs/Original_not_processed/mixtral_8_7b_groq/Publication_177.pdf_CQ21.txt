Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are performance metrics calculations that are performed after the model training. However, there is no explicit mention of other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix.

In the given tables, several performance metrics for two datasets, UBD\_45 and VP\_200, are presented for different models. These metrics include sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score. These metrics are calculated after the model training to evaluate the performance of the models.

Sensitivity, also known as recall, measures the proportion of true positive cases that are correctly identified by the model. Specificity measures the proportion of true negative cases that are correctly identified by the model. Precision measures the proportion of true positive cases among all the cases that are predicted as positive by the model. F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which provides a balanced assessment of the model's performance.

However, there is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrix in the given context. Saliency maps are a visualization technique that highlights the important features in the input data that contribute to the model's prediction. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predictions made by a model, showing the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative cases.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are limited to the calculation of performance metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score.
