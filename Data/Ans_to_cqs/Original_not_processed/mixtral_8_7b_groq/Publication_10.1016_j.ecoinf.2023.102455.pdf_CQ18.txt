Answer:::

In the provided context, the strategy to monitor the model performance during training involves using various performance metrics at different training and testing phases of multiple machine learning models.

The performance metrics used include the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (R), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (R) measures the accuracy of a model by comparing the variance of the predicted values to the variance of the observed values. R ranges from negative infinity to 1, with a value of 1 indicating a perfect match between observed and predicted values. RMSE measures the difference between predicted and observed values, with lower values indicating better performance. MAPE measures the average absolute difference between predicted and observed values as a percentage of observed values, with lower values indicating better performance.

The machine learning models used include MVMD-KELM, MVMD-CNN-BiRNN, CNN-BiGRU, RVFL, and KELM, among others. These models are trained and tested in phases, and their performance is monitored using the aforementioned metrics.

For instance, in the first set of results, the MVMD-KELM model has an R value of 0.985 during the training phase and 0.955 during the testing phase, indicating high accuracy. However, its MAPE value of 0.395 during the training phase and 0.429 during the testing phase indicates relatively higher error rates. Similarly, the CNN-BiRNN model has an R value of 0.998 during the training phase and 0.924 during the testing phase, indicating high accuracy, but its MAPE value of 0.330 during the testing phase indicates a relatively higher error rate.

In the second set of results, the CNN-BiGRU model has an R value of 0.985 during the training phase and 0.960 during the testing phase, indicating high accuracy. However, its MAPE value of 0.113 during the training phase and 0.130 during the testing phase indicates relatively higher error rates. Similarly, the RVFL model has an R value of 0.999 during the training phase and 0.933 during the testing phase, indicating high accuracy, but its MAPE value of 0.128 during the testing phase indicates a relatively higher error rate.

Overall, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using multiple machine learning models and performance metrics at different training and testing phases. This allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the models' performance and helps identify the best-performing models for a given task.
