Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention that the authors used various methods, including random erasing on the EfficientNet model, to improve performance. It can be inferred that the authors may have used common stopping criteria such as validation loss plateau or convergence of the training loss to determine when training is complete. These criteria are often used in machine learning to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the data.

Validation loss plateau refers to the point at which the validation loss stops decreasing or starts increasing, despite further training. This indicates that the model is no longer learning effectively from the training data and may be overfitting. Convergence of the training loss refers to the point at which the training loss reaches a minimum value and stops decreasing. This indicates that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data and is no longer making significant improvements.

In summary, while the context provided does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, it can be inferred that the authors may have used common stopping criteria such as validation loss plateau or convergence of the training loss.
