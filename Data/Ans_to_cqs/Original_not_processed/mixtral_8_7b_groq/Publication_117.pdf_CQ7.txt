Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that a training dataset was created by selecting 500 survey images at random to be used exclusively for training. This suggests that the data was split into at least a training set and a test set or validation set.

Additionally, it is mentioned that during training, transfer learning was used with the pretrained general-purpose YOLO object detector as a starting point. This implies that the data was likely split into a training set and a validation set during the transfer learning process.

It is also worth noting that the training dataset was created by tiling the selected survey images into 864 Ã— 864 subimages and passing them through the YOLO DCNN using pretrained weights from the COCO dataset. This suggests that the data was split into smaller subimages for training purposes.

Overall, while the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training are not explicitly stated, it is clear that the data was split into at least a training set and a test or validation set, and possibly also into smaller subimages for training purposes.
