Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. The text focuses on the description of a model called MLPnn-MC, which integrates the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm and Markov chain for land use and land cover (LULC) simulation. However, it does not specify the datasets used to train this model.

The MLP algorithm is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that uses backpropagation to train the network. It is widely used in various domains, including image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing. However, the particular datasets used in this study are not provided.

In the context of deep learning, popular datasets used for training and benchmarking models include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet. MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits, CIFAR is a collection of images used for object recognition, and ImageNet is a large-scale dataset of images with annotated objects. These datasets are widely used in the research community to evaluate the performance of deep learning models.

Therefore, while the provided context describes a deep learning model for LULC simulation, it does not specify the datasets used in the pipeline.
