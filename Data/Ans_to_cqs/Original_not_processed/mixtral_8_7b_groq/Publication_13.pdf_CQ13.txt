Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model can be determined from the context of the Mukhoti et al. (2020) paper. The model used in this paper is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained with the stochastic gradient descent algorithm. The softmax cross-entropy loss was used as the loss function for training the label classifier, which predicts the taxon of an input image. Additionally, an adversarial training procedure was used to train a domain classifier, which predicts the dataset of an input image. The shared part of the network was optimized to minimize the loss of the label classifier and maximize the loss of the domain classifier, thereby encouraging the model to learn features that are invariant between the two datasets.

The specific hyperparameters used in the model are as follows. The neural network was trained for 300 epochs with a batch size of 10. The learning rate was fixed at 0.01. The numbers of units in the two fully connected (FC) layers were 512 and 256, respectively. The dropout rate was not specified in the text. The model was trained using TensorFlow 2.5.0 libraries and statistical analyses were conducted with R 4.1.0.

It is important to note that the hyperparameters used in this model may not be optimal for other datasets or tasks. Hyperparameter tuning is an important step in deep learning model development, and different hyperparameters may need to be used for different datasets or tasks.
