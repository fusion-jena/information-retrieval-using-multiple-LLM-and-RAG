The provided context does not directly mention the specific optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of machine learning techniques for classifying fire-damaged monuments and quantifying carbon emissions from forest fires.

In general, optimization techniques are crucial in deep learning pipelines to minimize the loss function and improve model performance. Some commonly used optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSProp).

SGD is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters by taking the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter. However, it may not always converge to the optimal solution due to its simplicity.

Adam, on the other hand, is a more sophisticated optimization algorithm that adaptively adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the past gradients. It combines the advantages of two other optimization algorithms, AdaGrad and RMSProp, making it a popular choice for deep learning applications.

RMSProp is another optimization algorithm that adjusts the learning rate based on the moving average of the squared gradients. It is particularly useful for optimizing neural networks with non-convex loss functions.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that one of these optimization algorithms, such as Adam or RMSProp, was used to train the machine learning models. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
