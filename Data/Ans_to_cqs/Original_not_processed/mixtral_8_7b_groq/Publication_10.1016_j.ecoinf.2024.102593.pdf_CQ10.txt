Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several papers and resources related to the use of deep learning for avian diversity monitoring and bioacoustic tasks, but it does not give a specific link to a code repository on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. If you are interested in the specific deep learning pipeline used in the mentioned studies, I would recommend contacting the authors directly or checking the affiliated institutions' or labs' repositories.
