I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not include information about optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. The context focuses on a research framework for analyzing vegetation changes using kNDVI (kernel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and other geographical data. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
