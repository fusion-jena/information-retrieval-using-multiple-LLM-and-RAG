Answer:::

The pieces of context provided do not directly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines. However, they do mention some datasets that are used for training deep learning models for semantic segmentation tasks in urban scenarios.

COCO-Stuff (Caesar et al., 2018) is a dataset that includes 164K well-annotated images. Cityscapes (Cordts et al., 2016) is a benchmark dataset for the semantic understanding of urban street scenes. AED20K (Zhou et al., 2017) is a large-scale dataset for general scene understanding, and it consists of 150 semantic categories (or classes) such as car, person, sky, and so forth.

The paper "Assessing visual green effects of individual urban trees using airborne lidar data" by Chen et al. (2015) mentions the use of airborne lidar data for assessing visual green effects of individual urban trees. Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances. It can be used to create high-resolution 3D models of objects and environments, and it can be particularly useful for identifying and analyzing vegetation in urban areas.

In the paper "GreenCam: Measuring Green View Index from Photos using Deep Learning" (section 5.1), the authors propose a new dataset, called UGE-D (Urban Green Extraction Dataset), to train the GVI-learning model. However, the context does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used for this dataset.

In section 5.2 of the same paper, the authors use SegFormer (Xie et al., 2021), a state-of-the-art Transformer-based model for semantic segmentation, to complete GVI learning. SegFormer follows the encoder-decoder structure, which combines a Transformer-based encoder (i.e., MiT) with a lightweight decoder (i.e., ALL-MLP) that is composed entirely of multilayer perceptron (MLP) blocks. However, the context does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used for training SegFormer.

In summary, while the context provides information on some datasets used for training deep learning models for semantic segmentation tasks in urban scenarios, it does not provide explicit information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines.
