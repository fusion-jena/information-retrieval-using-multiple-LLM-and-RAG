Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, based on the provided context, appear to be related to the validation and training sets. However, there is no explicit mention of a test set.

During the training of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, two sets are used: a training set and a validation set. The training set is used to train the model, while the validation set is used to tune the model and prevent overfitting.

In the context, the training set is used to train the model in a two-stage process. In the first stage, only the top classifier (fully connected layer) is trained based on features extracted from processing images with a pretrained convolutional part of the network. In the second stage, the network is adjusted in a fine-tuned manner by training it as a whole.

The validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance during the training process. The model's performance is measured by calculating the accuracy and the number of misclassified images. The validation set is also used to determine the relevance of morphological characters in the classification process. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) generated heat maps are used to visualize the relevant characters for each of the three models. The percentages indicate the proportion of the respective morphological trait used for successful classification in the validation set.

The context suggests that the training set consists of 1472 images for species-level taxonomic identification, 1472 images for genus-level taxonomic identification, and 1472 images for subfamily-level taxonomic identification. The validation set consists of 374 images for species-level taxonomic identification, 374 images for genus-level taxonomic identification, and 374 images for subfamily-level taxonomic identification.

In summary, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in the provided context are related to the training and validation sets. The training set is used to train the model, while the validation set is used to tune the model and evaluate its performance. The training set consists of a larger number of images compared to the validation set.
