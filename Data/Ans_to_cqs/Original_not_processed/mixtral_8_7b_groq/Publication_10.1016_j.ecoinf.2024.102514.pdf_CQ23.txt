Based on the provided context, the deep learning model's generalizability was ensured through data splitting, specifically using an 80-20 ratio for training and testing datasets. This approach is a type of holdout method, a cross-validation technique that sets aside a portion of the data for testing after training the model on the remaining data (Tsamardinos et al., 2018; Wainer & Cawley, 2021; Wong, 2015).

In the context, 20 random sample locations were selected for training and 10 for testing, following the 80-20 ratio. This method of randomly selecting samples for training and testing is a common practice in machine learning and deep learning model development (Sajib et al., 2023). It helps ensure that the model can generalize well to unseen data by evaluating its performance on a separate dataset that was not used during training.

However, the context does not explicitly mention other measures taken to ensure generalizability, such as using a diverse dataset, stratified splitting, or other cross-validation techniques like k-fold cross-validation, nested cross-validation, or leave-one-out cross-validation. These methods can further enhance the model's ability to generalize by reducing overfitting and underfitting, providing more robust estimates of the model's performance, and accounting for class imbalance in the dataset (Bates et al., 2023; Nunez et al., 2021; Tsamardinos et al., 2018; Wainer & Cawley, 2021; Wong, 2015).

Answer:::
The deep learning model's generalizability was ensured by using the holdout method for data splitting, with an 80-20 ratio for training and testing datasets. This approach involved randomly selecting 20 sample locations for training and 10 for testing. While the context does not explicitly mention other measures like using a diverse dataset, stratified splitting, or other cross-validation techniques, the chosen method helps ensure that the model can generalize well to unseen data.
