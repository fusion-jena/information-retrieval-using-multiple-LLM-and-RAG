The provided context does not contain information about the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The text focuses on scaling hypotheses and the effects of data structure on machine learning models, specifically Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. It also discusses the impact of spatial patterns and environmental manifolds on the performance of these models. However, it does not mention deep learning models or their hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
