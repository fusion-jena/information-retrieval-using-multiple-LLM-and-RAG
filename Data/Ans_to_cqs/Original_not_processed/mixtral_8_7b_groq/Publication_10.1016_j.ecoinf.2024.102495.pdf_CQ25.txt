Answer:
The purpose of the deep learning model, as indicated by the context, is for classification. This is evident in the description of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which is a type of deep learning algorithm. The CNN consists of a feature extraction layer and a fully connected layer. In the feature extraction layer, several combinations of convolution layers, activation functions, and pooling are used to extract features from the given input data. The extracted features then undergo several matrix-merging processes and output mapping in the SoftMax activation function layer in the fully connected layer. The classification process occurs from the data processed in the feature extraction section.

Furthermore, the context shows a figure (Fig. 8) of a performance test of each configuration of the CNN model. The configurations include different optimizers, learning rates, and the use of dropout. The metrics used in the performance test include accuracy, which is a measure of how often the model's predictions match the actual labels. This again points to the model's purpose of classification.

In addition, the context includes a figure (Fig. 2) of a deep learning layer model. The model shows a clear progression from input data to output predictions, with the middle section consisting of several layers for feature extraction and transformation. This design is consistent with the architecture of a classification model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is for classification.
