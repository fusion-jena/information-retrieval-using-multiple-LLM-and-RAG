The provided context discusses the use of hyperparameters in machine learning models, including a deep learning model called GRU-DNN. However, the specific hyperparameters for the deep learning model are not explicitly listed. Therefore, I cannot provide a precise answer to the query.

However, based on general knowledge of deep learning models, common hyperparameters include learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, and activation functions. The learning rate controls the size of the steps in the gradient descent process, while the optimizer determines the strategy for updating the weights. The number of layers and neurons affects the complexity of the model, and batch size determines the number of samples processed before the weights are updated. Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the model.

In the given context, the hyperparameter K is discussed, which represents the number of previous observations used in the training and forecasting task. A grid search method was used to obtain the optimal K value for water temperature forecasting and significant wave height forecasting.

Additionally, the context mentions that each learning model, including the deep learning model, is subjected to a grid search to achieve the optimal parameter tuning. The hyperparameters are essential for influencing the behavior of a machine learning model.

Therefore, while the specific hyperparameters for the GRU-DNN model are not provided, it is likely that the model has hyperparameters similar to other deep learning models, such as learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons, batch size, and activation functions. Moreover, a grid search was performed to determine the optimal combination of hyperparameters for the model.
