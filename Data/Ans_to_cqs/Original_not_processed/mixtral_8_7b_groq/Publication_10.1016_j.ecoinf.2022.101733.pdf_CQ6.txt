Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, we can infer some possible preprocessing steps from related concepts discussed in the text.

First, the context mentions the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification, not deep learning models. Nonetheless, SVM and deep learning models often share similar preprocessing steps.

One such preprocessing step mentioned in the context is the use of a specific feature selection method for optimizing SVM parameters. This suggests that feature extraction or selection might be a preprocessing step before training a model.

Additionally, the text mentions the manual correction of incorrectly collected samples in the post-supervision step. This implies that data cleaning could be a necessary preprocessing step to handle potential issues like outliers or incorrect data points.

Furthermore, the context highlights the use of a normalized difference water index (NDWI) for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water. This suggests that some form of data normalization or scaling might be involved in the preprocessing pipeline. However, the text does not explicitly mention whether this normalization step is applied to the input data or the extracted features.

Lastly, the text mentions the use of six batches of Point Cloud Models (PCMs) produced using the same training sample and the same classifier. This implies that data splitting and batch creation might be other preprocessing steps before training the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps for deep learning models, we can infer some possible steps based on related concepts discussed in the text. These steps might include feature extraction or selection, data cleaning, normalization or scaling, and data splitting or batch creation. However, further information is needed to confirm these preprocessing steps for deep learning models specifically.
