Answer:::

The provided context discusses various tools and techniques used in the field of deep learning and data analysis, but it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some deep learning tools and libraries, such as Keras, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, which typically use optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and others.

For instance, TensorFlow, developed by the Google Brain team, is a powerful open-source library for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning. It supports a wide array of neural network architectures and optimization algorithms, including SGD and Adam. Similarly, Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It also supports various optimization techniques, including SGD and Adam. Lastly, PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, which is used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. It primarily uses an optimizer called Adam.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention deep learning libraries and tools that commonly utilize optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and others.
