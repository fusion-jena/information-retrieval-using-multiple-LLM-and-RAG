Answer:

The provided context discusses the use of computer vision and deep learning techniques in data collection and image processing for ecology and evolutionary biology. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I will provide a general overview of some common methods used to address data bias, including stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

1. Stratified splitting: Stratified sampling is a method used to ensure that the training, validation, and test sets are representative of the entire dataset. In this method, the dataset is divided into several subgroups or strata based on specific criteria (e.g., class labels), and then samples are randomly selected from each stratum to form the training, validation, and test sets. This ensures that each set contains a proportional representation of the classes, reducing bias and improving model performance.

2. Oversampling: Oversampling is a technique used to increase the representation of the minority class in an imbalanced dataset. This can be done by duplicating samples from the minority class or by generating synthetic samples using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Oversampling helps to prevent the deep learning model from being biased towards the majority class and improves its ability to generalize to new data.

3. Undersampling: Undersampling is the opposite of oversampling and involves reducing the number of samples in the majority class to balance the dataset. This method can be useful when dealing with large datasets, as it reduces computational costs and training time. However, it may lead to loss of valuable information and increased risk of overfitting.

4. Diverse data collection: Bias can also be addressed by collecting diverse and representative data. This includes gathering data from various sources, locations, and conditions to ensure that the dataset captures the natural variability of the target subject. Diverse data collection helps to improve the model's ability to generalize and reduces the risk of bias and overfitting.

In summary, while the provided context does not specifically mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, methods such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be employed to mitigate bias and improve model performance.
