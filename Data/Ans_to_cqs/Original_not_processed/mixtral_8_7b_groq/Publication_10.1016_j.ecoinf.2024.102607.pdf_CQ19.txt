Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch used in the studies. The context mainly focuses on the methods and strategies used in land use and land cover (LULC) mapping, including the use of Random Forest (RF) classifiers, Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform, and various sampling strategies. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query about the deep learning frameworks used in these studies.
