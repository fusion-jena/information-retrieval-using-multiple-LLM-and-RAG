Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models for alate detection on sorghum leaves are the number of epochs and batch size. The models were trained using 400 epochs and a batch size of 8. The number of epochs determines the number of times the detection model processes the dataset dedicated to training the model. The batch size defines the number of samples to be worked through before moving on to update the internal model parameters. However, the learning rate and optimizer used in the training process are not specified in the given context. Therefore, I cannot provide information on those hyperparameters.

The deep learning models used for this task are from the YOLOv5 family, which consists of five different versions (nano, small, medium, large, and extra-large) that differ in complexity, number of layers, and parameters. The model accuracy is lost when size is reduced, but training speed is improved.

The dataset was split in a ratio of 80:10:10 for training, validation, and testing sets, respectively. The training dataset consisted of 1543 images for the 640 × 640 pixels input resolution and 1637 images for the 1280 × 1280 pixels input resolution.

The evaluation metrics of the trained models are not specified in the given context. However, it is mentioned that deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can leverage large image datasets to make accurate predictions on new, unseen images.
