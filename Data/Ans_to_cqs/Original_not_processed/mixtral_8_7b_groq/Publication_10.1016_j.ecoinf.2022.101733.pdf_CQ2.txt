Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in the context provided primarily uses multi-source remote sensing (RS) images as its data format. Specifically, it involves the use of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data, which are types of RS data captured by satellites. These data are not in the traditional image format like JPEG or PNG, but are instead in a specialized format that contains multi-spectral bands and other features.

The Sentinel-2 data used in the pipeline come in different batches, starting from visible (red, green, and blue) bands in batch 1, then progressing to twelve multi-spectral (MS) bands in batch 2, and further including spectral indices in batch 3, spectral features in batch 4, and textural features in batches 5 and 6. Sentinel-1 data, which are synthetic aperture radar (SAR) bands, are added in batches 4, 5, and 6.

Additionally, the pipeline uses a digital surface model (DSM) in batch 6, which is a type of elevation data. The DSM is combined with the multi-spectral and textural features of Sentinel-2 and SAR features of Sentinel-1.

The pipeline also involves the use of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series data in the analysis. However, it is not explicitly mentioned if this data is part of the deep learning model or used in a separate analysis.

Therefore, the data formats used in this deep learning pipeline are primarily multi-spectral and SAR satellite data, with additional features such as spectral indices, textural features, and elevation data.
