Answer:::

The context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. Hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in training machine learning models, and various methods such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and more recently, automated machine learning platforms, can be used. However, the provided context does not contain details about which method was used for the model in question. It is possible that the authors used one of the aforementioned methods or developed a custom approach for hyperparameter tuning. To provide a definitive answer, additional information from the original research publication would be required.
