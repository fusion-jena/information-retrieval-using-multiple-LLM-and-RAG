The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of remote sensing images and semantic labels of land cover classes for training and validating the DeepLabV3+ model. Remote sensing typically involves the use of sensors mounted on satellites, aircraft, or drones to collect data about the Earth's surface. Therefore, it can be inferred that sensors are one method used for collecting raw data in this deep learning pipeline.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of public datasets in a related study ("Enhancing Land Cover/Land Use (LCLU) classification through a comparative analysis of hyperparameters optimization approaches for deep neural network (DNN)"). Public datasets are another common source of raw data for deep learning applications. These datasets can be obtained from various sources, including government agencies, research institutions, and online repositories.

Finally, the context does not mention any use of surveys as a method for collecting raw data. Surveys can be a useful method for gathering data in some deep learning applications, particularly those involving human subjects or subjective data.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific details about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that sensors and public datasets are used. The use of surveys is not mentioned.
