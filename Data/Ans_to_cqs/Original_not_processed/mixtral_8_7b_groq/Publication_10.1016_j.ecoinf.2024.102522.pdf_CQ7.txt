Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, the context does provide some insights into the evaluation of a model for predicting the spread of Hyphantria cunea, a type of invasive insect.

In the study, the authors used a maximum entropy model to predict the geographic distribution of Hyphantria cunea based on bioclimate, biological factors, geographical environment factors, and human spread factors. The model's performance was evaluated using a confusion matrix, which allowed for the calculation of the correct prediction rate for "present" and "absent" samples, as well as the overall validation accuracy.

In the context of deep learning, a common approach to splitting data for training, testing, and validation is to use a ratio such as 70% for training, 15% for testing, and 15% for validation. However, the specific criteria used to split the data can vary depending on the problem and the size of the dataset.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information on the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it does provide insights into the evaluation of a model for predicting the spread of Hyphantria cunea. The general approach to splitting data for deep learning model training involves setting aside a portion of the data for testing and validation, but the specific criteria used can vary.
