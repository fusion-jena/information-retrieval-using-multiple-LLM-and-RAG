Answer:::
Unfortunately, there is no specific code repository link provided in the given pieces of context regarding a deep learning pipeline for land use and land cover classification. However, there are several resources mentioned that can be used to develop such a pipeline.

The Vali et al. (2020) paper provides a comprehensive review of deep learning techniques for land use and land cover classification based on hyperspectral and multispectral earth observation data. The authors discussed various deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), which can be used for this task.

The Ustin et al. (2002) paper discusses the use of hyperspectral remote sensing for invasive species detection and mapping. Although this paper does not focus on deep learning, it provides insights into the use of hyperspectral data for land cover classification.

The Prasai et al. (2021) paper demonstrates the application of Google Earth Engine Python API and NAIP imagery for land use and land cover classification in Florida, USA. While this paper does not use deep learning, it provides a case study on land cover classification using remote sensing data.

The Van Der Walt et al. (2014) and Blondel et al. (2
