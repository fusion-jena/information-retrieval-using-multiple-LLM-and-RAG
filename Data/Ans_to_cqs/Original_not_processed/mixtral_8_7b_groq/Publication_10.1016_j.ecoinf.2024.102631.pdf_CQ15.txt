Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific details about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline of the work being discussed. However, it's important to note that the choice of optimization techniques is a crucial part of any deep learning model. 

Commonly used optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam. These methods update the model parameters based on the gradient of the loss function, but they differ in how they handle the learning rate and the accumulation of past gradients.

For instance, SGD updates the parameters by simply multiplying the gradient by a fixed learning rate and then subtracting this product from the current parameters. On the other hand, Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) is a more sophisticated method that adaptively adjusts the learning rate based on the estimated first and second moments of the gradients.

Given the complexity of the loss function used in the work (a linear combination of adversarial, L1, and perceptual loss functions), it's likely that a more advanced optimization method like Adam was used. However, this is just an educated guess, and the actual optimization technique is not specified in the provided context.
