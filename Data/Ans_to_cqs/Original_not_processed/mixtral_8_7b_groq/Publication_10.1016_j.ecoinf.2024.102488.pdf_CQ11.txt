Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about a deep learning pipeline or a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context discusses several studies related to remote sensing data and machine learning techniques, but it does not mention any deep learning pipeline or data repository link.

The first study by Ke et al., 2017, presents LightGBM, a gradient boosting decision tree algorithm, but it does not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or data repository link.

The second study by Lang and Kasischke, 2008, discusses the use of C-band synthetic aperture radar data to monitor forested wetland hydrology in Maryland's coastal plain, but it does not mention any deep learning pipeline or data repository link.

The third study by Li et al., 2021, focuses on mapping multi-layered mangroves from multispectral, hyperspectral, and LiDAR data, but it does not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or data repository link.

The fourth study by Li et al., 2022, analyzes the responses of net primary productivity to phenological dynamics based on a data fusion algorithm in the northern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, but it does not mention any deep learning pipeline or data repository link.

The fifth study by Liu et al., 2019, discusses the combination of multi-source remote sensing data and improved models and integration strategies, but it does not provide any information about a deep learning pipeline or data repository link.

Therefore, I cannot provide a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the given context.
