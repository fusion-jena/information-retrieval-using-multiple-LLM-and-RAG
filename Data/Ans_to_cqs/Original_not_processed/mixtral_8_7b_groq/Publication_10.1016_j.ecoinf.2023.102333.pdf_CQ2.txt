Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of satellite imagery in a deep learning pipeline for land-use and land-cover (LCLU) classification, specifically for the Talassemtane National Park (TNP) using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Therefore, the primary data format used in this pipeline is image data.

The authors utilized Remote Sensing (RS) datasets, which were processed and analyzed using a Deep Neural Network (DNN) model. To prepare the image data, five spectral indices were incorporated to differentiate six land use classes. These spectral indices are mathematical transformations of the original multispectral image data, which help highlight specific features relevant for LCLU classification, such as vegetation, water, or built-up areas.

The context does not mention the use of other data formats like audio, video, or CSV in this particular deep learning pipeline. However, it is important to note that deep learning pipelines can handle various data formats depending on the problem at hand. For instance, Natural Language Processing (NLP) models typically use text data in formats like CSV or JSON, while audio processing models might use WAV or MP3 files. Similarly, video processing models might work with MP4 or AVI files.

In summary, the provided context focuses on a deep learning pipeline that uses image data, specifically satellite imagery, for LCLU classification. Other data formats, such as audio, video, or CSV, are not mentioned in this context.
