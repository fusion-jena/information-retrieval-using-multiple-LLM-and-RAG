Answer:::

The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipelines for ecological studies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided contexts. However, some of the studies have used remote sensing data from satellites such as MODIS and Landsat for vegetation monitoring and analysis.

For instance, Zhang et al. (2003) used MODIS data to monitor vegetation phenology, while Zhang et al. (2016) blended Landsat and MODIS data to estimate grassland biomass. Beck et al. (2006, 2011) also used MODIS data for monitoring vegetation dynamics and productivity changes at high northern latitudes.

In addition, some studies have used image datasets for plant species identification. For example, Barr√© et al. (2017) developed a computer vision system for automatic plant species identification using LeafNet, while Waldchen and Mader (2018) used machine learning for image-based species identification.

Furthermore, some studies have used video datasets for wildlife recognition. Carvalho (2019) used a chimpanzee face recognition dataset from videos in the wild, while Clapham et al. (2020) developed an automated facial recognition system for brown bears using a deep learning approach.

Therefore, while the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipelines for ecological studies are not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that remote sensing data from satellites, image datasets for plant species identification, and video datasets for wildlife recognition have been used in previous studies.
