Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the specific platform that was used to deploy the deep learning models for seagrass coverage estimation and mapping. The context includes details about the models used, such as encoder-decoder based models, deep capsule networks, deep CNN, and Faster R-CNN with NASNet, as well as the datasets and results in terms of mIoU, precision, recall, and accuracy. However, it does not mention any details about the cloud platforms (e.g. AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform) that were used for deploying these models.
