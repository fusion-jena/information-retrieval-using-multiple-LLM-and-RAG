Answer:::

In the context provided, there is specific focus on the use of deep learning for classifying fish species using thumbnail images. The data for this task is collected through underwater visual censuses conducted by divers. However, this method has limitations such as depth and time constraints, and the slow rate of data compilation. Therefore, it is not explicitly mentioned as a general method for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

In a broader sense, raw data for deep learning can be collected through various means, depending on the specific task. For instance, in computer vision tasks, data can be collected using cameras or other imaging devices. In natural language processing, data can be obtained from text corpora, social media, or other sources of textual information. In audio processing tasks, data can be collected using microphones or other audio recording devices.

Additionally, there are public datasets available for various deep learning tasks, such as ImageNet for computer vision, LibriSpeech for speech recognition, and Wikipedia for natural language processing. These datasets provide a large amount of labeled data for training deep learning models.

In some cases, data can also be collected using sensors or other IoT devices. For example, in predictive maintenance, sensors can be used to collect data on the operating conditions of machinery, which can then be used to train a deep learning model to predict when maintenance is required.

Overall, the method for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline depends on the specific task and the availability of data. Public datasets, surveys, sensors, and other sources of data can all be used to collect raw data for deep learning.
