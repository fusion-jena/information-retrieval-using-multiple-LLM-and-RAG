Answer:::

The provided context includes information about various techniques used in data preprocessing for machine learning and deep learning, although it does not explicitly mention the use of these techniques in the context of addressing data bias. However, we can infer the use of some of these techniques based on the given information.

Stratified sampling is a technique used to ensure that the training and testing datasets are representative of the entire dataset. This technique is used to ensure that each subset of the data contains the appropriate percentage of each class, which can help to prevent bias in the model. In the context of marine ecology, this technique can be used to ensure that the training and testing datasets contain an appropriate percentage of data from different geographical regions, depths, or time periods.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to address class imbalance in the dataset. Class imbalance can occur when one class has significantly more instances than another class, which can lead to bias in the model. Oversampling involves creating additional instances of the minority class, while undersampling involves removing instances of the majority class. In the context of marine ecology, this technique can be used to ensure that the model is trained on an appropriate number of instances of each species, even if one species is more abundant than another.

Diverse data collection is a technique used to ensure that the dataset contains a wide variety of instances. This technique can help to prevent bias in the model by ensuring that it is trained on a diverse set of data. In the context of marine ecology, this technique can involve collecting data from different geographical regions, depths, time periods, or environmental conditions.

The provided context also includes information about various machine learning algorithms used in marine ecology, including Random Forest, SMO, Multilayer Perceptron, and Na√Øve Bayes. These algorithms can be used to build predictive models using the preprocessed data. However, the context does not provide information on how these algorithms address data bias.

In summary, the provided context includes information on techniques such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection, which can be used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does not provide explicit information on how these techniques are used in the context of marine ecology.
