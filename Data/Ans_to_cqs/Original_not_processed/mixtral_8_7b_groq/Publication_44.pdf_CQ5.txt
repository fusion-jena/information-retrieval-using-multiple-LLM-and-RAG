Answer:::
The context provided does not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the use of a dataset for finetuning a pre-trained DeepLabv3+ model with ResNet-101 as a feature extractor, but it does not specify the name of the dataset. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query without additional context.
