Answer:::
The provided context does not contain information about the use of deep learning models in the study. The study focuses on using machine-learning techniques for sustainable fishing and species distribution modeling. Specifically, it mentions the use of Weka for implementing Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) and the Support Vector Machine (SUS) algorithm. Four different methods were used to build the classification model, but none of them are deep learning frameworks. Therefore, I cannot provide the names of the frameworks used to build the deep learning model because the study does not mention the use of deep learning models.
