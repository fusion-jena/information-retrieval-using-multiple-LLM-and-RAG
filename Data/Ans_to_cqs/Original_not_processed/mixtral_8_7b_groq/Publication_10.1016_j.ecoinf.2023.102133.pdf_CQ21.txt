Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention that feature analysis was performed and ML algorithms were used to compensate for missing values in the dataset. It also mentions that the performance of the model was evaluated using metrics, but it does not specify what those metrics are or how they were calculated.

In general, after training a machine learning model, there are several common postprocessing steps that are often taken. These can include:

* Metrics calculation: This involves calculating various metrics to evaluate the performance of the model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, etc.
* Confusion matrix: This is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
* Saliency maps: These are a way of visualizing the importance of different input features to the model's output. They can be used to understand which features the model is paying attention to and to identify any potential biases.
* Model interpretation: This involves explaining how the model is making its predictions, often through techniques such as feature importance, partial dependence plots, or SHAP values.
* Hyperparameter tuning: This involves adjusting the parameters of the model to improve its performance.
* Deployment: This involves deploying the model into a production environment where it can be used to make predictions on new data.

It is possible that some or all of these steps were taken in the process described in the context, but the information provided does not specify.
