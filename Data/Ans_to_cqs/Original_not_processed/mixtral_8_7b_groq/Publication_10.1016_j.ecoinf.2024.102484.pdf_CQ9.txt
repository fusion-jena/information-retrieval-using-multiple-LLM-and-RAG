Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the studies mentioned. The studies discuss the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning techniques for monitoring ecosystem service change and assessing land degradation. However, they do not mention where the data and code for the deep learning pipeline are stored or shared. It is possible that the data and code are available in a repository that is not listed in the provided context, or they may not have been made publicly available. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
