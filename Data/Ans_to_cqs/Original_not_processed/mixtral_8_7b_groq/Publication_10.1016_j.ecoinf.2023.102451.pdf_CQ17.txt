Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are no specific regularization methods mentioned that were used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline for the EMViT-Net model. However, it is mentioned that data augmentation and normalization were performed as preprocessing steps to address the diversity of training data and data imbalance problems in classification tasks. Data augmentation can sometimes act as a form of regularization by increasing the amount of training data and providing the model with slightly different versions of the same image, which can help the model generalize better.

Regularization techniques such as dropout, L1/L2 regularization, and early stopping are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out a certain percentage of neurons during training, which helps to prevent over-reliance on any single neuron and encourages the model to learn more robust features. L1/L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage large weights, which can help to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model. Early stopping is a regularization technique that stops training when the performance on a validation set starts to degrade, which can help to prevent overfitting by stopping training before the model starts to memorize the training data.

Without more information about the specific deep learning pipeline used for the EMViT-Net model, it is difficult to say for sure which regularization techniques were used. However, based on common practices in deep learning, it is likely that one or more of these regularization techniques were used to prevent overfitting.
