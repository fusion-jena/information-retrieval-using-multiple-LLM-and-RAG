Answer:::

The text provided does not give a detailed description of the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for deep-sea ecosystems. However, it does mention that manual annotations were used to generate training, validation, and testing datasets. This suggests that human experts were involved in the data annotation process.

In the context of marine research, data collection often involves surveys and sensors. Surveys can be conducted using various platforms such as ships, submersibles, or autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Sensors can include cameras, hydrophones, and other instruments that measure physical and chemical properties of the environment. Public datasets may also be used, although the text does not explicitly mention this.

For instance, Levin et al. (2019) highlight the need for global observing in the deep ocean, which implies the use of various observational methods and sensors. Similarly, Langenk√§mper et al. (2017) present BIIGLE 2.0, a tool for browsing and annotating large marine image collections, suggesting the use of imaging sensors and manual annotation.

In the specific context of the text, the authors used a pre-trained deep learning model (YOLOv3) and modified some parameters for their application. They generated their own datasets for training, validation, and testing, which implies that they collected and annotated their own data. However, the text does not provide details about the data collection methods.

In summary, while the text does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for deep-sea ecosystems, it can be inferred that surveys, sensors, and manual annotations were likely involved in the data collection and annotation process.
