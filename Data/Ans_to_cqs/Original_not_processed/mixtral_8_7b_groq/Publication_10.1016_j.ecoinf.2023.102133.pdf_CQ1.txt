Answer:::

The raw data used in the deep learning pipeline for estimating crop evapotranspiration is collected primarily through sensors. More specifically, weather stations and an EC tower are used to record weather data and micro-meteorological data at sub-hourly time-steps. The weather station records data such as wind speed, relative humidity, and temperature, while the EC tower measures variables like net radiation, sensible heat flux, and latent heat flux. These sensors are connected to a CR3000 datalogger with a 2 GB memory card for data storage. Additionally, high and low-frequency data related to wind speed, H2O vapor concentrations, and CO2 in the atmosphere are also collected using the EC tower at a frequency of 20 Hz.

It is important to note that not all the records acquired by the EC tower are used in the analysis. Only the records acquired on days where the rainfall height is less than 2.5 mm are considered suitable for the analysis. This is done to ensure that the data used in the deep learning pipeline is not affected by significant rainfall events.

While the context provided does not explicitly mention the use of surveys or public datasets for collecting raw data, it is possible that these methods were used to gather additional data to supplement the sensor data. However, without further information, it is not possible to confirm the use of surveys or public datasets in this particular deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the primary method for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for estimating crop evapotranspiration is through the use of sensors, specifically weather stations and an EC tower. These sensors record various weather and micro-meteorological data at sub-hourly time-steps, which are then used in the deep learning pipeline. While surveys and public datasets may have been used to supplement the sensor data, the context provided does not provide sufficient information to confirm their use.
