Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information on how the hyperparameters of the artificial neural network (ANN) model were optimized. It only mentions that an artificial neural network was implemented as the third approach for SPAD value modeling based on Rasp2SPAD indices, and that the model residuals obtained in each of the 100 successful runs were analyzed for a more reliable evaluation of the model performance. However, it does not specify the method used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
