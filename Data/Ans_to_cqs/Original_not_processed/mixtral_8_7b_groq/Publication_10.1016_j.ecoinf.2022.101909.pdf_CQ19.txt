Answer:::

The specific deep learning frameworks used to build the model are not mentioned in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the models were built using a deep learning library compatible with ResNet50, UMAP, and other necessary tools mentioned in the context. Common deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch have built-in support for ResNet50 and other required functionalities, making them suitable candidates for constructing the models.

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google Brain Team. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem for building and deploying machine learning models, including support for deep learning and computer vision tasks. TensorFlow has a built-in implementation of ResNet50 and other tools required for transfer learning and fine-tuning.

Keras is another popular deep learning library, which is user-friendly and modular. It can run on top of TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK, providing a high-level API for building and training deep learning models. Keras also includes a ResNet50 model and other necessary functionalities for the described tasks.

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook AI Research Lab. It is known for its simplicity and ease of use, as well as its seamless transition between CPUs and GPUs. PyTorch has a wide range of pre-built models, including ResNet50, and provides the necessary tools for transfer learning and fine-tuning.

Based on the provided context, it can be concluded that the models were likely built using one of these deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch) that support ResNet50 and other required functionalities. However, the exact framework is not specified.
