Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it mentions a case study involving the Hainan gibbon and a bird classification task. Therefore, it can be inferred that the models were trained on datasets related to these subjects.

The absence of explicit dataset names (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet) suggests that the authors might have used unnamed or custom datasets specific to their research. These datasets could consist of spectrograms or other audio representations for the bird classification task or data related to the Hainan gibbon case study.

In general, when working with deep learning models in various research fields, researchers often use popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet for benchmarking and comparing model performance. However, in this particular case, the context focuses on the model architecture and its adaptation to ecology datasets, without specifying the exact names of the datasets.
