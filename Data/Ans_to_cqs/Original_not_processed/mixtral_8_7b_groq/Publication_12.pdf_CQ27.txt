Answer:::

The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, as described in the given context, does not explicitly mention steps such as model serialization or platform selection. However, it does provide information about the testing and refinement of the Waveman model, which includes using filtered and unfiltered data for testing, optimizing the BatNet, and collecting audio-files from different human and natural conditions to test the model's generalization.

The Waveman model was first built using a series of python scripts, and then trained using a training dataset consisting of 111,244 images. The model was trained for 50-60 times using a GPU (Nvidia 1080ti) for two hours and 10 minutes. After training, the model contained refined parameters and a graph which were saved for downstream analysis.

Next, the model was tested using filtered data (i.e., validation dataset) to test different model and taxon bias. Then, audio-files were collected from a corridor for 15 species to test how to lower the misidentification and false positives. After this, the BatNet was optimized, and audio-files were collected from different human and natural conditions to test the generalization of the model. These audio-files were unfiltered and were directly imported into Waveman.

Therefore, while the text does not explicitly mention model serialization or platform selection, it can be inferred that the trained model was saved for downstream analysis and testing, and the testing was done on different platforms such as filtered and unfiltered data, and human and natural conditions. However, the specific details of model serialization and platform selection are not provided in the given context.
