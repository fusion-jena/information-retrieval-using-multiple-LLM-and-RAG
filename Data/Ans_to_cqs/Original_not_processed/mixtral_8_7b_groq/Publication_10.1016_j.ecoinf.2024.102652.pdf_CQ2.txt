Answer: Based on the provided context, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is an image. The study focuses on soil salinity and vegetation detection and segmentation using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model. To achieve this, the researchers added five salinity indices to the original 5-band multispectral image, increasing the total number of bands. This modified image was then used as input to the deep learning model. Therefore, the data format utilized in this deep learning pipeline is an image.
