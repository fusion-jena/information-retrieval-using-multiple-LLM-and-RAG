Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The texts mention different types of models and methods for species distribution modeling, but they do not provide details on the optimization of hyperparameters such as grid search or random search.

In the context of species distribution modeling, the focus is on the evaluation of models and the use of different engines for modeling. The text by Fois et al., 2018, discusses the use of species distribution models at a local scale to guide the search for poorly known species, but it does not mention the optimization of hyperparameters. Similarly, the text by Guisan and Thuiller, 2005, focuses on predicting species distribution and offering more than simple habitat models, but it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters.

The text by CeË‡snovar, 2022, introduces the cmdstanr package, which is an R interface to CmdStan, a tool for Bayesian inference. However, it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters. The text by Friedman et al., 2010, discusses regularization paths for generalized linear models via coordinate descent, but it does not mention the optimization of hyperparameters in the context of species distribution modeling.

The text by Gabry et al., 2014, clarifies that Maxent is not a presence-absence method, but it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters.

In conclusion, while the provided context discusses various models and methods for species distribution modeling, it does not provide information on the optimization of hyperparameters such as grid search or random search. Therefore, the answer to the query is: I don't know.
