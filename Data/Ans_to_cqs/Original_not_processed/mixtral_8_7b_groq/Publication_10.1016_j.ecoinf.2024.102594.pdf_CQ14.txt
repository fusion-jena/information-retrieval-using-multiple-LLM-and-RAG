The context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. However, it does mention a comparative analysis of hyperparameters optimization approaches for a deep neural network (DNN) model used for enhancing Land Cover/Land Use (LCLU) classification.

Hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in the development of machine learning models, as it can significantly impact the model's performance. There are various methods for hyperparameter optimization, including grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves testing all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a specified range, while random search selects hyperparameters at random within a specified range. Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic approach to select the most promising hyperparameters to test next, based on the performance of previous tests.

Without specific information on the method used, it is difficult to provide a precise answer. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that the researchers conducted a comparative analysis of different hyperparameters optimization approaches for the DNN model. This suggests that they explored and compared the performance of different hyperparameter optimization methods to determine the best approach for their specific application.

It is also worth noting that the context provides information on the spatial resolution of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images used in the study. The resolution of the UAV images varies from 2m to 16m, and the classification results are compared for each resolution. It is possible that the hyperparameters optimization was performed for each spatial resolution to determine the optimal hyperparameters for each resolution.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, it can be inferred that the researchers conducted a comparative analysis of different hyperparameters optimization approaches for the DNN model used in the LCLU classification. The spatial resolution of the UAV images used in the study suggests that the hyperparameters optimization may have been performed for each resolution. However, further information is needed to provide a more precise answer.
