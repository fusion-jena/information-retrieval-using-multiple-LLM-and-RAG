Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning model being used in the described research. The models mentioned are linear regression, artificial neural network, CART (Classification and Regression Tree), and Random Forest regression (RFR). These models are used for tasks such as predicting wetland area and depth, assessing water depth in shallow water bodies, and retrieving coastal bathymetry.

Among these, CART and RFR are tree-based models used for regression tasks. CART stands for Classification and Regression Tree, and it is a binary tree algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by recursively splitting the data into subsets based on the feature and threshold that minimize the variance of the target variable within each subset.

On the other hand, Random Forest regression (RFR) is an ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and stability of the model. It works by building multiple decision trees on randomly sampled subsets of the data and averaging their predictions.

However, none of these models are deep learning models. Deep learning models are neural networks with multiple layers, and they are typically used for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is not clear as no deep learning model was mentioned or used in the described research.
