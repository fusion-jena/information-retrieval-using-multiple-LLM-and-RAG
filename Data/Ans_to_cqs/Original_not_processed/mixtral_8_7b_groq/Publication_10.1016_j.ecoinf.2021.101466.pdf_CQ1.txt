Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific details about how the raw data was collected for the study. However, it does mention that data augmentation techniques were used to create variation in the training data. Specifically, the authors prepared 4000 images for each category by applying a data augmentation method to existing images. No information is given about where these original images came from or what methods were used to collect them.

In general, there are several ways that raw data can be collected for a deep learning pipeline. Some common methods include:

1. Surveys: Surveys can be used to collect data from a large number of people or organizations. Surveys can be conducted online, over the phone, or in person.
2. Sensors: Sensors can be used to collect data from the environment, such as temperature, humidity, or motion data.
3. Public datasets: There are many public datasets available that can be used for deep learning research. These datasets are often collected by researchers or organizations and made available for others to use.
4. Private datasets: Private datasets are collected by individuals or organizations for their own use. These datasets may not be available to the public.

It's important to note that the specific methods used for collecting raw data will depend on the type of data that is being collected and the goals of the study. In the case of the provided context, it appears that the authors used existing images and applied data augmentation techniques to create additional variation in the training data. However, the original source of the images is not specified.
