The provided context discusses a study that uses the Random Forest (RF) algorithm for predicting Above Ground Biomass (AGB) and focuses on variable importance measures, model performance evaluation, and hyper-parameter tuning. However, the context does not mention any deep learning pipeline or data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.

Data augmentation techniques are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size of the training dataset and prevent overfitting. These techniques create new synthetic samples by applying transformations to the existing data. Some common data augmentation techniques include:

1. Flipping: Flipping is a technique where the image is horizontally or vertically flipped. This helps the model to learn symmetrical patterns in the data.
2. Rotating: Rotating is a technique where the image is rotated by a certain angle. This helps the model to learn rotation invariant features.
3. Scaling: Scaling is a technique where the image is scaled up or down. This helps the model to learn features that are scale invariant.
4. Translation: Translation is a technique where the image is translated or shifted in a certain direction. This helps the model to learn features that are translation invariant.
5. Cropping: Cropping is a technique where a portion of the image is removed. This helps the model to learn features that are invariant to the location of the object in the image.

These techniques can be applied to the training dataset to generate new synthetic samples. The augmented dataset can then be used to train the deep learning model.

In summary, the provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, scaling, translation, and cropping are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size of the training dataset and prevent overfitting.
