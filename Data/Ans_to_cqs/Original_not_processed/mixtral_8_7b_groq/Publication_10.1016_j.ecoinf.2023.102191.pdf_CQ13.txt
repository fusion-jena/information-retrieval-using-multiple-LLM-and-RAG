The provided context does not contain information about the use of a deep learning model for analyzing the data. The text describes a study that uses an app to collect data on marine life observed during recreational dives. The data collected includes the frequency and abundance of specific taxa, as well as metadata on location, number of dives, and number of divers. This data is then normalized based on sampling effort. The study also includes a survey of app users to assess the usability of the app and its potential value for the diving community.

Therefore, I cannot provide the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, as the text does not mention the use of such a model.
