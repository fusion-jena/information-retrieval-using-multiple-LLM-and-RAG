Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The text focuses on the use of Global Fishing Watch (GFW) data and the Global Record of Stocks and Fisheries (GRSF) semantic knowledge base for estimating fishing pressure on stocks and other species. It mentions the use of a machine learning model for classifying fishing activity cells in GFW data, but it does not specify the type of hardware used for training this model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
