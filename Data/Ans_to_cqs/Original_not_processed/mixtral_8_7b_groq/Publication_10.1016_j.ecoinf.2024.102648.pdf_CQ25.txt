Answer:::

The deep learning model in the study mentioned is used for forecasting the percent disease incidence of Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD) in upland cotton. Specifically, the model employed is a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), which is a type of artificial neural network (ANN). The purpose of this deep learning model is regression, as it is used to predict the percentage of CLCuD incidence based on weather data, including minimum, maximum, and average temperature, growing degree days, relative humidity, cumulative rainfall, and whitefly population.

The deep learning model is trained on weather data recorded from 2011 to 2019 at weather stations located in four different locations in the north-western zone. The model's performance is evaluated using training and R-squared values.

In summary, the deep learning model in this study is used for regression analysis, specifically for predicting the percent disease incidence of CLCuD based on weather data.
