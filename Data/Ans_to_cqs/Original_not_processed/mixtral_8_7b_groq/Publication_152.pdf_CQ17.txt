Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are two regularization methods mentioned that are used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines: data augmentation and U-Net.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the amount of training data by applying random transformations to the existing data. This method is mentioned in the context as a way to improve the F1 score for image classification tasks. Specifically, small changes in brightness and zoom for images collected by UAV flights at a constant height above ground can help to significantly improve the results. However, large changes in the height and width range cannot be used as they can turn all vegetation too close visually and create confusion for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Data augmentation is also mentioned in reference [26], which introduces a method called Random Image Cropping and Patching (RICAP) for data augmentation in deep CNNs.

U-Net is a CNN architecture that was initially designed for use in the biomedical area but has since been used in other fields, including remote sensing. It is mentioned in the context as a network used for semantic segmentation. In reference [20], U-shaped nets were used to identify eucalyptus trees in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest successfully. U-Net is a type of network that can help prevent overfitting by allowing for a larger and more diverse training set.

In addition to these two methods mentioned in the context, other regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines include L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping. L1 and L2 regularization add a penalty term to the loss function, which encourages the model to have smaller weights and thus prevent overfitting. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by making the model more robust. Early stopping is a method where training is stopped as soon as the validation error starts to increase, which prevents the model from overfitting to the training data.

In summary, data augmentation and U-Net are two regularization methods mentioned in the context that are used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines. Other regularization methods include L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping.
