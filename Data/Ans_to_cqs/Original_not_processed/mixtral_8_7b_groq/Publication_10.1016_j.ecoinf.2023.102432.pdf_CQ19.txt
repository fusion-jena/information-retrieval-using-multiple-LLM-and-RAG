Answer:::

 The provided context does not give information about the use of deep learning models or the specific frameworks (such as TensorFlow or PyTorch) used to build them. The context discusses the use of the MTMI-SMF (Matrix Transformation for Mixture-of-Experts with Spatially-Varying Feature spaces) algorithm for training datasets, but it does not mention deep learning models. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer this query.
