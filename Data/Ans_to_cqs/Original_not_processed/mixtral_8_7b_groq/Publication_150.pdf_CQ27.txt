Answer:::

The text provided does not give a detailed description of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does give some information about the training process that can be inferred.

The models were trained using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.01 for all models except MansNet, which was initially set at 0.1. The learning rate was reduced by a factor of 10 after steps of 30 epochs. Batch normalization was used, and models were trained for 150 epochs using Nvidia Tesla K80 or P100 GPUs.

After training, the models were likely to be serialized, which is the process of converting the trained model into a format that can be stored and loaded again. Common serialization formats include JSON, XML, and Protocol Buffers. The serialized model can then be deployed to a target platform.

The text does not provide information on the specific platform used for deployment. However, it does mention that MnasNet-A1 was designed to be faster for mobile devices, which suggests that it could be deployed on a mobile platform.

In summary, while the text does not provide a detailed description of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the models were trained using the SGD optimizer, batch normalization, and GPUs. After training, the models were likely to be serialized and deployed to a target platform, which could be a mobile platform for MnasNet-A1.
