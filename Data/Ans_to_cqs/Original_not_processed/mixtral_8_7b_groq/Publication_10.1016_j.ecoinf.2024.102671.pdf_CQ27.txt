The provided context does not contain information about training or deploying a deep learning model. Instead, it focuses on the use of the InVEST model for ecological risk assessment and carbon storage analysis.

The InVEST model is employed to simulate changes in ecosystem services, specifically to assess the impact of Land Use and Land Cover Change (LUCC) on carbon storage variations. The model is used to determine the aggregate carbon storage and measure the carbon sequestration from 2000 to 2020. Carbon density values for each land use category are calculated using formulas provided in the context.

The context also discusses spatial analysis techniques, such as calculating normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and analyzing the stability within ecological carbon sink risk zones using zonation. Additionally, it mentions the use of remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) technology for ecological risk assessment.

However, the context does not mention any steps related to training or deploying a deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the query based on the provided information.
