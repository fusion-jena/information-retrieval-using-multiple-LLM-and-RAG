Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about specific post-processing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix after model training. However, it does mention the calculation of certain metrics for model evaluation.

The context discusses a study that involves training a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for predicting soil nutrient concentrations using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) in MATLAB. The model training process includes data pre-processing in ViewSpecPro and The Unscrambler, and parameter value selection based on Root Mean Square Error of Cross Validation (RMSEcv).

Post-processing steps typically involve evaluating the performance of the trained model. In this context, several metrics are calculated to assess the model's performance. These metrics include R-squared (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Residual Predictive Deviation (RPD), and Relative Prediction Inaccuracy (RPIQ). 

R-squared (R2) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model. RMSE is a standard way of measuring the error of a model in predicting quantitative data. RPD is the ratio of the standard deviation of the measured data to the RMSE of the prediction, and RPIQ is a measure of the relative prediction inaccuracy.

Therefore, while the context does not explicitly mention specific post-processing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrix, it does indicate that the model's performance is evaluated using several metrics including R2, RMSE, RPD, and RPIQ.
