Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the context provided is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. This is mentioned in the study by Gokul et al. (2023), where they used an LSTM model to predict PM2.5 levels for Hyderabad city. The LSTM model is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is particularly suited to time series data, making it a suitable choice for air quality prediction which often involves time-dependent data.
