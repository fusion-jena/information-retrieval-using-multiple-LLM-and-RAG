Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is Inception-ResNet-v2, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN).

The Inception-ResNet-v2 model is a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network architecture developed by Google researchers. It is a hybrid model that combines the Inception architecture with the Residual Network (ResNet) architecture. The Inception architecture uses multiple convolutional filters with different sizes to extract features from the input data, while the ResNet architecture uses skip connections to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem and enable the training of deeper networks.

In the described pipeline, the Inception-ResNet-v2 model is used to extract relevant features from endemic bird species. The model is trained on a dataset of 27 endemic bird species, and the learned features are then transferred to a second target network to train a new dataset of endemic bird species. This transfer learning approach enables the model to utilize knowledge from previously learned tasks and improve the learning of the target predictive function.

The Inception-ResNet-v2 model is trained using the mini-batch gradient descent algorithm with a batch size of 32 and a learning rate of 0.0001. The Adam optimizer is used to fine-tune the model with an exponential decay rate of first-moment estimation of 0.9. The training dataset is augmented 10 times to allow the deep networks to converge and improve the ability of the model to generalize adeptly.

Overall, the Inception-ResNet-v2 model is a powerful CNN architecture that is well-suited for image recognition tasks, such as the recognition of endemic bird species. The transfer learning approach enables the model to utilize knowledge from previously learned tasks and improve the learning of the target predictive function, making it a suitable choice for the described pipeline.
