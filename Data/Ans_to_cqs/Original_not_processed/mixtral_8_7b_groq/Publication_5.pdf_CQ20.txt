Answer:::
The deep learning model was trained using a NVIDIA Titan X GPU. This information is provided in the first sentence of the context, which states that "The model score reached its maximum after approximately 5000 iterations with a NVIDIA Titan X GPU (3584 CUDA cores)". The use of a GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is common in deep learning training due to its ability to perform many calculations simultaneously, making it more efficient than a traditional CPU for the types of matrix and vector operations used in deep learning. The specific model of GPU used here is a NVIDIA Titan X, which has 3584 CUDA cores, a parallel computing platform and application programming interface model created by NVIDIA, which allows software developers to use a CUDA-enabled graphics processing unit for general purpose processing.
