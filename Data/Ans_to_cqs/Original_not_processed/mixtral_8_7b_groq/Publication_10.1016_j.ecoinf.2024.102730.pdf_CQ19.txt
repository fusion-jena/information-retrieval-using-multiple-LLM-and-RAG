Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific information about the deep learning framework used in the study "Hyperparameter-tuned batch-updated stochastic gradient descent: plant species identification by using hybrid deep learning" by Barhate, Pathak, and Dubey (2023). However, it is mentioned that the study uses Python for their implementation.

Python is a popular programming language for implementing deep learning models, and there are several deep learning frameworks available for Python, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. TensorFlow and PyTorch are two of the most widely used frameworks.

TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google Brain Team. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.

PyTorch, on the other hand, is an open-source machine learning library based on the Torch library, which was developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. PyTorch is known for its simplicity and ease of use, as well as its seamless transition between CPUs and GPUs.

Therefore, while the specific framework used in the study is not mentioned, it is likely that either TensorFlow or PyTorch was used, as they are the most popular frameworks for deep learning in Python.
