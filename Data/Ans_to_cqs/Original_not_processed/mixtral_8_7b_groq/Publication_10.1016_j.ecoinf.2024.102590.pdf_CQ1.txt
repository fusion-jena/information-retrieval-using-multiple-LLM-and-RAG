Answer:::

The provided context discusses the data collection process for a supervised learning workflow, rather than a deep learning pipeline. However, it does offer insights into the methods used for collecting raw data in this specific study.

In this study, the researchers collected raw data through field surveys to develop a baseline for future land-use and land-cover (LULC) analysis. They did not generate random points over the entire boundary; instead, they used vegetation types described by Gertenbach (1983) to guide the placement of sampling plots. These sampling plots were then used to collect training and validation points. The size of the sampling plots was determined by calculating 5% of the total area covered by the boundary and dividing that area by the number of vegetation types intersecting the boundary.

If a vegetation type was too small to accommodate the entire sampling plot, the researchers placed the largest area within that vegetation type and assigned the remaining area to the nearest largest vegetation type. This approach allowed them to collect training/validation points that were representative of the diverse vegetation within each boundary.

It is important to note that this data collection method was used for a supervised learning workflow and may not directly apply to deep learning pipelines. In deep learning, data collection methods can vary and may include surveys, sensors, public datasets, or a combination of these sources. The choice of data collection method depends on the specific requirements of the deep learning task, the availability of data, and the desired level of accuracy.

In summary, while the provided context discusses a specific data collection method for a supervised learning workflow, deep learning pipelines can use various data collection methods, such as surveys, sensors, and public datasets, depending on the specific task and data availability.
