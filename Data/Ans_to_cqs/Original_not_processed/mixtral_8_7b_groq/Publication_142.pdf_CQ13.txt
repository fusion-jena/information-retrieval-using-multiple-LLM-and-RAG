The provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or the optimizer. However, it does mention that the network is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data. ImageNet is a large-scale image recognition dataset that is often used to initialize deep learning models for computer vision tasks. It is possible that the authors used standard hyperparameters for the ImageNet pre-training phase and then adjusted them for the fine-tuning phase on the Pl@ntNet data.

The authors do mention that particular attention is given to the quality and completeness of the training datasets during the learning phases, which suggests that they may have used techniques such as data augmentation or transfer learning to make the most of their available data. These techniques can help to improve the performance of deep learning models, especially when the amount of available training data is limited.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, it does suggest that the authors may have used standard hyperparameters for the ImageNet pre-training phase and then adjusted them for the fine-tuning phase on the Pl@ntNet data. They also likely used techniques such as data augmentation or transfer learning to make the most of their available data.
