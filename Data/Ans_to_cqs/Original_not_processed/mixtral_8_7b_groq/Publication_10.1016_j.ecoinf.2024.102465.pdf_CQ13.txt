Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention that the model used is a combined LSTM-CNN framework for sentiment analysis and HRNet for semantic segmentation.

In general, for an LSTM-CNN model, common hyperparameters for LSTM include learning rate, number of hidden units, number of layers, dropout rate, and optimizer (such as Adam, RMSprop, or SGD). For CNN, common hyperparameters include learning rate, number of filters, filter size, pool size, number of layers, dropout rate, and optimizer.

For HRNet, common hyperparameters include learning rate, number of layers, number of channels, dropout rate, and optimizer.

It is important to note that the choice of hyperparameters depends on the specific dataset and problem being addressed. Therefore, it is likely that the hyperparameters used in the study are not specified because they were determined through experimentation and optimization for the specific dataset and task.
