Answer:::
The provided context does not include specific information about the regularization methods used in the LaDeco system to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Regularization techniques like dropout, L2 regularization, and others are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of models and improving their generalization ability. However, the context focuses on the description of LaDeco, its components, and the methodology of its development, without delving into the specific regularization techniques employed. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer based on the given information.
