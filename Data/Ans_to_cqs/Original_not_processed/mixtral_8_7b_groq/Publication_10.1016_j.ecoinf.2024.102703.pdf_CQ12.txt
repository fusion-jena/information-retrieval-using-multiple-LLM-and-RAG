Answer:::

The text provided does not describe the use of a deep learning model such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer. Instead, it describes the use of a three-layer backpropagation (BP) artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting Total Suspended Solids (TSI) based on aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) measurements.

An ANN is a type of machine learning model that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of interconnected nodes or "neurons" that process information and learn from input data. A BP ANN is a type of ANN that uses the backpropagation algorithm to adjust the weights of the connections between neurons in order to minimize the error between the predicted and actual outputs.

In the described pipeline, the BP ANN has three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer consists of two neurons that correspond to the aCDOM(254) and Fn(355) measurements. The hidden layer and output layer each consist of a single neuron that corresponds to the TSI predictor. The maximum training times for the ANN are set to 10,000 and the training error is set to 0.001.

The ANN is trained using 64 water samples and validated using the remaining samples. The validation accuracy is assessed by calculating the coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) between the measured and predicted TSI values.

Therefore, the text describes the use of a three-layer BP ANN for predicting TSI, rather than a deep learning model such as a CNN, RNN, or Transformer.
