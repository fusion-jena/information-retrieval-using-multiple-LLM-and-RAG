Answer:::

The provided context discusses two metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model for species assemblage prediction. These metrics are:

1. A30: This metric measures the percentage of test observations for which the correct label is returned among the first 30 species. It is a representative measure of the model's performance for common species.
2. MSA30: This metric measures the percentage of test observations for which the correct label is within the first 30 classes returned, given that each species in the test set is given the same weight. This metric is used to evaluate a particularly difficult task, given that the test set contains a large number of species.

Additionally, the context also mentions two types of success rate calculations: micro-average (Ak) and macro-average (MSAk). However, these are not specific metrics but rather ways of calculating the success rate.

It is important to note that the context does not explicitly mention other commonly used metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall. Therefore, it can be inferred that the primary metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this specific context are A30 and MSA30.
