The context provided does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. It is possible that the data was collected specifically for this research and is not publicly available. Alternatively, it might be hosted on a platform not mentioned in the list you provided, such as a private server or the authors' institutional repository. I would recommend contacting the authors or checking their affiliated institutions' repositories for more information.
