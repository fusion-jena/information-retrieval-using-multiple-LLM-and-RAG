Answer:::
The provided context discusses a study that uses deep learning for image segmentation in the field of ecology and evolutionary biology, specifically for processing fish images. The study developed a toolkit called Sashimi for this purpose. However, the context does not provide information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. Therefore, I cannot provide the specific GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket link where the code repository is available. For more details, it is recommended to contact the authors of the study, Shawn T. Schwartz and Michael E. Alfaro, at the University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA.
