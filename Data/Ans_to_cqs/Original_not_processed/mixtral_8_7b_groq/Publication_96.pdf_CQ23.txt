Answer:::

The study by Vera L.S. Arruda et al. (n.d.) developed a semi-automatic methodological approach for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome in Brazil using Deep Learning techniques available on Google Cloud computing and Landsat 8 imagery. However, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.

However, the study did use a portion of the samples for training (70%) and testing (30%) the DNN algorithm to estimate its ability to map burned areas in the study area. This approach helps to assess the accuracy of the algorithm, but it is biased because it uses the same sample sets to test the model. Therefore, an additional accuracy assessment using those validation points was conducted in the analysis.

Additionally, the study conducted the analysis using graphics processing units (GPUs) and specialized hardware components for running parallel arithmetic operations on the Google Cloud suite of cloud Platform. The use of Google Cloud computing allowed for the processing of large datasets and the implementation of the deep learning algorithm.

Moreover, the study focused the mapping analysis of burn scars on the period between May and December, which comprised 98% of fire hotspots detected in 2017 by INPE. This approach helped to ensure that the model was trained and tested on the most relevant and representative data for the study area and time period.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, the study did use a training and testing approach, Google Cloud computing, and a focused time period to help ensure the accuracy and generalizability of the deep learning model.
