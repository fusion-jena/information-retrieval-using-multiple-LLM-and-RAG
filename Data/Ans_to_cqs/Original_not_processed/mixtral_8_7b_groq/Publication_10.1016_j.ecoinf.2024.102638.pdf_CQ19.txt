Answer:::
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) used to build the models. However, the paper by Reichstein et al. (2019) discusses deep learning techniques for data-driven earth system science, which implies the use of deep learning frameworks.

In the context of machine learning, the paper mentions various algorithms such as KNN, GP, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and SVR. These algorithms can be implemented using different deep learning frameworks. For instance, TensorFlow and Keras provide easy-to-use functions for implementing KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting algorithms. Similarly, PyTorch provides a library called PyTorch-Trees that implements various tree-based models.

Moreover, the paper mentions the use of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), which is a type of feed-forward neural network. MLP can be implemented using various deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.

Therefore, while the specific deep learning frameworks are not mentioned in the given context, it can be inferred that the models were built using deep learning frameworks that support the implementation of various machine learning algorithms.
