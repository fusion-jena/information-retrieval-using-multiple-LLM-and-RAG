Answer:::

I am unable to provide the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline because it is not mentioned in the given pieces of context. The context includes several studies that have used various methods for image analysis and classification in different fields such as wetlands classification, mangrove crown diameter measurement, and tree canopies segmentation. However, none of the studies provided a link to a data repository for their deep learning pipeline. I would suggest looking at the original studies or contacting the authors for more information.
