The provided context does not contain information about how the raw audio data is collected for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various methods used for processing the audio data, such as repeating signals to force a fixed duration of 2 seconds or resizing audio images to a fixed size. However, it does not mention any details about the collection of the raw data.

The context also describes different types of input features used for the CNN-based model, such as Mel-spectrogram, harmonic-component based spectrogram, percussive-component based spectrogram, and a SubSpectralNet architecture with Mel-spectrogram as input. It also mentions a triplet sampling method used in [30] for generating triplet spectrograms as input to CNNs. However, these features are derived from the raw audio data, and the context does not provide any information about how the raw data is collected.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.
