Answer:::

 The provided context discusses the use of machine learning models, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forests (RF), to estimate net growth in Atlantic Forest fragments in Brazil. However, it does not mention the use of a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide a direct answer to the query regarding the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model in this specific study.

However, I can provide a general answer regarding the evaluation metrics commonly used for deep learning models. Deep learning models can be evaluated using various metrics, depending on the specific problem and the nature of the target variable. Some common evaluation metrics for deep learning models include:

1. Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions.
2. Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions (correctly labeled positive instances) out of all positive predictions.
3. Recall (Sensitivity): The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances.
4. F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced assessment of both.
5. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
6. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The square root of the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.
7. Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²): The proportion of variance in the target variable that is explained by the model.

These metrics can be used to assess the performance of deep learning models in various applications, depending on the specific problem and the desired trade-offs between different performance aspects.
