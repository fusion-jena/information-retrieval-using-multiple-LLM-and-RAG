Answer:::

The code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available on GitHub. This information is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, but it can be inferred from the statement "Our open-source code is available on GitHub" found in the text. The authors emphasize the reusability and applicability of their models to other research cases, which suggests that they have made the code publicly accessible for others to use and build upon. However, the exact URL of the GitHub repository is not provided in the context. Therefore, readers interested in accessing the code would need to search for it on GitHub using the authors' names, the article title, or other relevant keywords.
