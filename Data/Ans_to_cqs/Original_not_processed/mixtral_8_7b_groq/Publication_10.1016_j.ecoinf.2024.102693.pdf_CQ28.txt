The provided context does not give information about the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning models. The text focuses on describing different models, their architectures, and their performance on the IP102 dataset. It includes details about ResNet-50, ViT-S/16, Volo-d1, and ViP-Small/7 models, as well as some ensemble methods developed by the authors. However, there is no mention of any cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform that was used for deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this query based on the given context.
