The provided context discusses the methodology for predicting animal behavior, particularly in T-maze experiments with zebrafish and rats, using traditional models, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. However, it does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, deep learning models are prone to overfitting due to their complexity and the large number of parameters involved. Regularization methods are commonly employed to mitigate this issue by reducing the complexity of the model and preventing it from learning idiosyncrasies in the training data.

Some common regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines include:

1. L2 regularization: This method adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, reducing its complexity and preventing overfitting.

2. Dropout: During training, dropout randomly sets a fraction of the model's hidden units to zero, effectively preventing them from contributing to the forward pass. This helps to break up co-adaptations between hidden units, reducing overfitting and improving the model's generalization performance.

3. Early stopping: This method involves monitoring the model's performance on a validation set during training. If the model's performance on the validation set starts to degrade, training is stopped, preventing further overfitting.

4. Data augmentation: This method involves artificially increasing the size of the training set by applying random transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping) to the existing training examples. This helps to increase the diversity of the training data and prevent overfitting.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these regularization methods, it is possible that they were employed in the deep learning pipeline used in the study. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
