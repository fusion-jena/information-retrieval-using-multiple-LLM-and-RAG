Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it is not explicitly stated which specific measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model used in the study titled "Extreme deep learning in biosecurity: the case of machine hearing for marine species identification." However, there are some indications that the researchers may have taken steps to promote generalizability.

Firstly, the study utilizes a large dataset, which is often beneficial for improving the model's ability to generalize. The authors mention that their model was trained on "huge training data sets." While the exact size and composition of the dataset are not provided, the implication is that it is sizable and potentially diverse, which can aid in generalizability.

Secondly, the authors mention the use of Regularized Autoencoder Learning (MIGRATE_ELM), which incorporates a form of regularization. Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting, which can improve a model's ability to generalize to unseen data. However, the context does not specify the exact form of regularization used.

Lastly, the authors mention that their deep learning model (DELE) is based on Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs). ELMs are known for their ability to generalize, as they can determine the appropriate output weights towards the most effective resolution of a problem, and their performance is not solely based on their training data set. This suggests that the authors may have chosen ELMs for their generalizability properties.

However, without more specific information, it is difficult to definitively say which measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model in this study.
