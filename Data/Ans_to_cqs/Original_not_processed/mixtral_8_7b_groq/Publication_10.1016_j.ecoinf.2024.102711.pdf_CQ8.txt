Answer:

The provided context does not give information about the code repository for the AutoGluon deep learning pipeline. While the text offers details about the AutoGluon library, its capabilities, and its use in a specific study, it does not mention where the code for the pipeline is located. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query. If you are interested in the AutoGluon library, you may want to look at the official documentation or search for it on popular code repositories like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
