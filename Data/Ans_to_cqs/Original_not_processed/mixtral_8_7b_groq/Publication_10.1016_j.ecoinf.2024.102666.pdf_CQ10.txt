Answer:::

I am unable to provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline for atmospheric correction (AC) in satellite images of aquatic environments as it is not mentioned in the given pieces of context. The context provides information on various studies related to AC in aquatic environments using different algorithms and sensors. However, there is no mention of any deep learning pipeline or its code repository link. I hope this information is helpful.
