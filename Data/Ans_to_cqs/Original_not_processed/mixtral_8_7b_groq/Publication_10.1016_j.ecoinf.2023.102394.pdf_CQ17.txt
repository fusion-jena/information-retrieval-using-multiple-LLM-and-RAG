Answer:::

The text describes the use of dropout as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Dropout layers were created with dropout rates of 0.2 and 0.3 to reduce overfitting in the MLP model used in the study. However, the text does not explicitly mention the use of L2 regularization.

Dropout is a regularization technique used in deep learning to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping out, or "turning off," neurons during training. This helps to ensure that the model does not become too reliant on any one neuron or set of neurons, and therefore generalizes better to new data. The dropout rate determines the probability that each neuron will be dropped out.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is another regularization technique that can be used to prevent overfitting. It works by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from assigning too much importance to any one weight. This helps to prevent the model from memorizing the training data and improves its ability to generalize to new data.

In summary, the text describes the use of dropout as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of L2 regularization. Dropout works by randomly dropping out neurons during training, while L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to discourage the model from assigning too much importance to any one weight. Both techniques can be effective at preventing overfitting and improving the generalization performance of deep learning models.
