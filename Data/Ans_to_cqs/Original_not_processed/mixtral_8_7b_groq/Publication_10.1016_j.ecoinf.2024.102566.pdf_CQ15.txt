The provided context does not directly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for biomass estimation. However, it does discuss the use of machine learning methods and remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation.

In the context, Morais et al., 2021, employed a method with low data dependency that integrates forest inventory data with remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation due to the insufficiency of high-quality training samples. Bortolot and Wynne, 2005, used small footprint LiDAR data and an individual tree-based approach that incorporates training data for estimating forest biomass.

In the context, the focus is on the data collection methods, the importance of high-quality training samples, and the integration of remote sensing imagery for biomass estimation. The specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for biomass estimation are not discussed.

Optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for various applications. SGD is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters by computing the gradient of the loss function for a single training example. Adam is an adaptive optimization algorithm that computes individual learning rates for different parameters based on the estimates of the first and second moments of the gradients.

Therefore, while the provided context does not mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for biomass estimation, it is still essential to consider optimization techniques such as SGD and Adam for training deep learning models for biomass estimation.
