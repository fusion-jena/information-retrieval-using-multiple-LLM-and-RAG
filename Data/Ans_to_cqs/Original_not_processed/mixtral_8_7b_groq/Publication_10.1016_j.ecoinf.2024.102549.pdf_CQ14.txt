The text provided does not give information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for predicting or comparing water quality across different water bodies, and the use of various algorithms for extracting algal blooms. It also provides a list of water quality parameters and their corresponding levels. However, it does not mention any methods used for hyperparameter optimization such as grid search, random search, or others. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
