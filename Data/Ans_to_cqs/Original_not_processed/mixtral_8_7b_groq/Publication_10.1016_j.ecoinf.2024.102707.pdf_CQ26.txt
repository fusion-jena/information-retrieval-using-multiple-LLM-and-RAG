The provided context discusses the training data and inference method used in a study, but it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some data preprocessing steps and techniques related to data collection that can help reduce data bias.

One such technique is the collection of diverse data. Witharana and Lynch (2016) used very high spatial resolution satellite images to detect penguin guano, which required the collection of diverse data to account for different environmental conditions. Similarly, Weimerskirch et al. (2018) studied the behavioral and physiological responses of sub-Antarctic seabirds to flights of drones, which required the collection of data on multiple species and statuses.

Another technique mentioned in the context is data augmentation, which can help increase the size and diversity of the training data. Xu et al. (2024) used data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and scaling to improve the performance of their deep learning model.

While the context does not mention specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling, it does mention that the authors tested working with different spatial resolutions of the imagery during training. This approach can help reduce data bias by ensuring that the model is trained on a diverse set of images with varying spatial resolutions.

Overall, while the context does not provide a comprehensive list of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, it does mention some data preprocessing steps and techniques related to data collection that can help reduce data bias.
