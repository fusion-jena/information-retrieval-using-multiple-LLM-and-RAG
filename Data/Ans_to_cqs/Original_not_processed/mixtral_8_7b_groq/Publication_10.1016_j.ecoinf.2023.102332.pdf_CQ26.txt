Answer:::

The provided pieces of context do not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention some preprocessing techniques and tools used in text mining and natural language processing.

In the context "Harnessing artificial intelligence technology and social media data to support cultural ecosystem service assessments" by Egarter Vigl et al., 2021, the authors mention using the R packages tidytext and tm for tokenization, lemmatization, and English stop words removal. These packages can help in preprocessing text data, but they do not specifically address data bias.

In the context "Identifying wildlife observations on Twitter" by Edwards et al., 2022, the authors use machine learning techniques to identify wildlife observations on Twitter but do not mention any bias mitigation techniques during preprocessing.

In the context "LSAfun - an R package for computations based on latent semantic analysis" by Günther et al., 2015, the authors present an R package for latent semantic analysis, a technique used for extracting and representing the contextual meaning of words in a text. However, they do not discuss data bias or preprocessing techniques.

In the context "Vector-space models of semantic representation from a cognitive perspective: a discussion of common misconceptions" by Günther et al., 2019, the authors discuss vector-space models of semantic representation but do not mention data bias or preprocessing techniques.

Therefore, based on the provided pieces of context, I cannot provide a complete answer to the query. However, some techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: splitting the data into subsets while preserving the distribution of key variables.
2. Oversampling: increasing the frequency of the minority class in the dataset.
3. Undersampling: decreasing the frequency of the majority class in the dataset.
4. Diverse data collection: collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population.

These techniques can help in reducing data bias and improving the performance of deep learning models.
