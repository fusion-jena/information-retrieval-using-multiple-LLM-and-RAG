Answer:::
The provided context includes a table (Table 3) describing the architecture of a proposed CNN model, but it does not include information about the hyperparameters used in the model such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context also includes descriptions of other CNN models (VGG16, Xception, ResNet50, and DenseNet121) but again, there is no information about the specific hyperparameters used in these models.

Additionally, the context includes a table (Table 10) that compares the training and prediction run-times of the different CNN models, but this table also does not include any information about the hyperparameters used in the models.

In summary, while the context provides information about the architecture of the proposed CNN model and other CNN models, it does not include information about the specific hyperparameters used in these models. Therefore, I am unable to answer this question without additional information.
