The provided pieces of context do not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Zhang et al., 2023. The study mentions the use of a deep learning-based data-driven model for detecting time-delay water quality indicators of wastewater treatment plant influent, but it does not specify where the data used in the study is stored or made available.

It is important to note that studies often make their data available through various data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, GBIF, or other platforms. However, the decision to share data and the choice of repository can depend on various factors, including the policies of the journal where the study is published, the funding agency requirements, and the researchers' preferences.

Therefore, if you are interested in accessing the data used in the study by Zhang et al., 2023, I would recommend contacting the authors directly or checking the journal's data availability policy. The study was published in the Chemical Engineering Journal, which has a data availability policy that encourages authors to make their data available upon request.

In summary, the provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Zhang et al., 2023. I recommend contacting the authors or checking the journal's data availability policy to access the data.
