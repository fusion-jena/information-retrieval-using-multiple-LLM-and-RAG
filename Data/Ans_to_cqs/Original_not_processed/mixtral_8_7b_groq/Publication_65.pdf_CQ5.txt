Answer:::

The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned in the provided context. The text focuses on the comparison of different architectures such as FCN, U-Net, SegNet, and DeepLabv3+ for a remote sensing application. However, it does provide details about the training/test protocol and data augmentation techniques used. The authors trained all networks from scratch using a dataset divided into training, validation, and test sets, consisting of approximately 20%, 60%, and 20% of the data, respectively. The input patch size was 256 Ã— 256 pixels, and data augmentation techniques like rotation, noise, and flip were used to increase the dataset size by six times. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the performance of these architectures for remote sensing tasks rather than focusing on a particular dataset.
