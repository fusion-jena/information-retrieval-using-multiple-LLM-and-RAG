The text provided does not give information about a deep learning pipeline using standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, it discusses a machine learning application in the context of seagrass presence and distribution in the Mediterranean Sea. The dataset used in this study includes environmental drivers (water temperature, salinity, nutrients, transparency), ecosystem components (bathymetry and bottom substrate), and human influence (distance to cities, ports, and river outflows). The dataset is not balanced, with the Cymodocea class being the dominant one, making up 75% of the dataset.

The authors use a machine learning algorithm for 5-class classification and rank the algorithms based on the F-measure instead of accuracy due to the dataset's imbalance. The text also discusses determining variable importance to simplify the analysis, better understand the physical concepts, and exclude variables that may confuse the model, improving accuracy and learning/testing speed.

In summary, the text discusses a machine learning application for seagrass presence and distribution in the Mediterranean Sea using a specific dataset, not one of the standard deep learning datasets (MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet).
