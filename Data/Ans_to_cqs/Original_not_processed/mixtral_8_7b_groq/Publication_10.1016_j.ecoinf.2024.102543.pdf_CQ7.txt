Answer:::

The data used for training deep learning models, such as the one in the context, is typically split into three sets: training, validation, and testing. Each set has a specific purpose and helps ensure the model's performance, effectiveness, and ability to generalize.

The training set is the largest of the three, comprising 82% (or 4000 images in the context) of the data. This set is used to train the model and adjust its parameters, allowing it to learn from a diverse range of examples and patterns in the data. By training on a large and varied dataset, the model can capture important patterns and relationships that will help it make accurate predictions.

The validation set, which consists of 13% (607 images) of the data, is utilized during training to fine-tune hyperparameters and assess the model's performance on unseen data. The validation set helps prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on new, unseen data. By evaluating the model's performance on the validation set throughout the training process, you can identify the best set of hyperparameters and ensure that the model generalizes well to new data.

Lastly, the testing set, which includes 5% (260 images) of the data, serves as an independent evaluation of the model's performance on completely unseen data. The testing set provides a reliable measure of the model's real-world effectiveness, as it evaluates how well the model performs when encountering new data it has never seen before. This is an essential measure of a model's ability to generalize and is a crucial aspect of deep learning model evaluation.

In summary, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training involve creating three sets: a large training set for learning, a validation set for fine-tuning and assessing performance during training, and a testing set for evaluating the model's real-world effectiveness and generalization ability.
