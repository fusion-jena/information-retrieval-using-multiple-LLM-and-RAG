Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of birdsong identification software and acoustic monitoring, which implies the use of audio data.

In the study by Chalmers et al. (2021), the authors used acoustic monitoring and deep learning to model animal biodiversity. While they do not specify the data format, it can be inferred that they used audio data since acoustic monitoring was used.

Furthermore, the study by Corcoran et al. (2021) evaluated new technology for biodiversity monitoring, including drone surveys. While this does not directly relate to the deep learning pipeline, it does show the use of technology for monitoring biodiversity, which could potentially include audio data.

In addition, the fieldwork and species identification in the study by Fischer et al. (n.d.) used a combination of observer knowledge, data from the eBird website, and two low-cost phone apps: Morcombe and Stewart Guide to Birds of Australia and Bird Song Id Australia. These apps likely use audio data for birdsong identification.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that audio data is used in the deep learning pipeline for birdsong identification and acoustic monitoring. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of other data formats such as image, video, or CSV.
