Answer:::

 Based on the information provided, there is no direct link to a data repository for the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the query. The URL provided is for an article on Medium about improving cloud detection with machine learning, and the Ecological Informatics75(2023)10203216 and 1020327 references appear to be to a scientific paper that may use a deep learning pipeline, but there is no mention of a data repository link in either source.

 Additionally, the abstract and keywords of the paper do not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository. The abstract focuses on wetlands, wetland use intensity, East Africa, ecosystem health, and earth observation, and the keywords listed are Wetlands, Wetland use intensity, East Africa, Ecosystem health, Earth observation, and Sentinel-2.

 Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a link to the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.
