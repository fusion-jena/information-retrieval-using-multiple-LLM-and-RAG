Answer:::

The context does not provide explicit information about the specific method used to optimize the hyperparameters of the model, such as grid search or random search. However, it does mention that a random hyperparameter search was conducted to determine the optimum model structure. This implies that some form of randomized parameter optimization was used, where different combinations of hyperparameters were tried to find the best model.

In more detail, the number of layers, hidden nodes per layer, and the number of training epochs were varied during the search. The models were trained on species-specific data using various combinations of input variables, such as altitude, coverage, Xbar, and Ybar. The performance of each model was evaluated using training AUC, validation AUC, positive predicted value (PPV), and negative predicted value (NPV).

Additionally, the impact of window size on model performance was explored, with increasing window size consistently improving the model performance. The data for each model were randomly split into 10 equal parts for k-fold cross-validation, and the models were trained on 90% of the data while being validated on the remaining 10%. This process was repeated for each tenth of the data to ensure robustness.

In summary, although the context does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameter optimization method, it suggests that a randomized search was employed to find the best model structure among various combinations of layers, hidden nodes, and training epochs.
