Answer:::

In the context provided, the data for deep learning model training is split into five different configurations for train and test sets. These are 80-20, 60-40, 50-50, 40-60, and 20-80, where the numbers represent the percentage of the whole dataset used for training and testing respectively. For example, in the 80-20 split, 80% of the whole dataset is used for training, and the remaining 20% is used for testing.

It is important to note that during the training process, there is no explicit mention of a validation set. However, the authors have mentioned that they have run all their experiments across a whole range of train-test set splits. This suggests that they might have used the test set as a proxy for validation, by evaluating the model's performance on the test set after each epoch, and adjusting the model's parameters accordingly.

Moreover, the authors have mentioned that they have used a more diverse set of training data to improve the accuracy of their model. This implies that they might have also used a validation set during the training process, to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data, and to prevent overfitting. However, the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.

In addition, the authors have mentioned that they have used the same set of hyperparameters across all the experiments, such as the solver type, base learning rate, and learning rate policy. This suggests that they have used a consistent approach for training and evaluating their models, which can help in making fair comparisons between the results of different experimental configurations.

Overall, the context suggests that the authors have used a range of train-test set splits to evaluate the performance of their deep learning models, and have possibly used a validation set during the training process. However, the context does not provide enough information to confirm the exact criteria used for splitting the data.
