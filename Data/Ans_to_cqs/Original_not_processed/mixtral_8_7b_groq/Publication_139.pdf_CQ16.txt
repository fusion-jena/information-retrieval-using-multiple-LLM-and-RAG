Answer:::

The context provided does not explicitly state the specific criterion used to determine when training is complete. However, it does mention the use of early stopping to prevent overfitting, which implies monitoring the validation loss and stopping the training when it stops improving or starts to degrade. This is a common practice in machine learning to avoid over-optimizing the model to the training data.

In addition, the model was trained for a set number of epochs, typically between 10 and 15, and the training ceased when this number was reached. This is another common practice to ensure that the model does not overfit the training data.

Therefore, while the exact criterion is not specified, it can be inferred that the training likely stops based on a combination of reaching a set number of epochs and observing the validation loss to prevent overfitting.
