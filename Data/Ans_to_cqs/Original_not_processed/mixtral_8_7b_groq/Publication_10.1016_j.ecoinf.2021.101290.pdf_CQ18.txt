Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided paper. However, it can be inferred that they might have used some form of monitoring and evaluation during the training phase of their machine learning models.

The paper discusses the use of AWS Kinesis and Apache Kibana, which provide access to state-of-the-art machine learning methods for event-stream processing and mature querying languages. These tools likely include features for monitoring model performance during training, such as real-time evaluation metrics and visualization dashboards.

Moreover, the authors emphasize the importance of high-quality data and automated annotation for leveraging machine learning, computer vision, and artificial intelligence in their research. Monitoring model performance during training is crucial for ensuring the quality of the resulting models, as it allows researchers to identify issues such as overfitting, underfitting, or biased predictions.

In the context of their research, the authors propose to automatically annotate and analyze data online while the experiment is still running. This closed-loop experimentation approach implies a need for real-time monitoring of model performance to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the annotations and analyses.

While the specific strategy for monitoring model performance during training is not detailed in the paper, it can be inferred that the authors used some form of real-time evaluation and visualization tools, likely provided by AWS Kinesis, Apache Kibana, or other machine learning libraries and frameworks.
