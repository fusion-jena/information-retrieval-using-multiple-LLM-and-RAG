Answer:::
The text provided does not give specific details about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that they use a biased and an unbiased dataset for training and testing their model, respectively. The biased dataset is created by randomly taking 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing, while the unbiased dataset avoids Same-Specimen-Picture Bias (SSPB) by placing images from the same specimen either in the training or testing dataset.

Additionally, the model architecture is described, consisting of several convolution, max pool, batch norm, LRN, inception, average pool, and linear layers, followed by a softmax layer for classification. The model has a total of 34M operations and 1M parameters.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the model performance is being monitored by comparing the classification accuracy between the biased and unbiased datasets. Additionally, the complexity of the model and the number of parameters can also be used as indicators of overfitting or underfitting during the training process. However, without further information, this is just an assumption.
