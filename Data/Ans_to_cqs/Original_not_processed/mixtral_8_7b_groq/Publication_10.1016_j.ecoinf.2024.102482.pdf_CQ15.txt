Answer:::

Deep learning models often use optimization techniques to minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance. Some of the commonly used optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam).

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular optimization algorithm used in deep learning. It updates the model's parameters by computing the gradient of the loss function for a single training example, rather than the entire training dataset. This approach makes SGD computationally efficient and suitable for large-scale machine learning problems.

Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) is another optimization algorithm that has gained popularity in deep learning. Adam is an extension of SGD that adaptively adjusts the learning rate based on the historical gradient information. It combines the advantages of two other optimization algorithms, AdaGrad and RMSProp, to provide a more efficient and robust optimization method.

In the context of the provided articles, Mortezavi et al. (2023) used deep learning approaches, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and ConvLSTM, for hourly short-term streamflow forecasting. However, the article does not specify the optimization algorithm used in the deep learning pipeline.

Du et al. (2021) analyzed the impacts of climate change on water resources in the major countries along the belt and road. While the study used machine learning techniques, it did not mention any specific optimization algorithms used in the deep learning pipeline.

Dun et al. (2022) proposed a dynamic graph convolution neural network based on spatial-temporal correlation for air quality prediction. The study used the Adam optimizer to train the deep learning model.

In summary, the optimization techniques commonly used in the deep learning pipeline include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam). While the provided articles used deep learning approaches, only Dun et al. (2022) explicitly mentioned using the Adam optimizer. The other articles did not specify the optimization algorithm used in the deep learning pipeline.
