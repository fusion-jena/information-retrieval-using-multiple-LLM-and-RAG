Answer:::

The text provided does not give explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier system was utilized for image processing during the monitoring and tracking of Procapra przewalskii. This system features an NVIDIA Volta GPU with 512 CUDA cores and an 8-core ARMv8.2 CPU. However, it's important to note that this information pertains to the inference phase, not the training phase.

Often, different hardware is used for training and inference in deep learning applications. Training typically requires more computational power and is often done on servers equipped with multiple high-end GPUs or specialized hardware like TPUs (Tensor Processing Units). On the other hand, inference can be performed on less powerful hardware, like the edge device in this case.

Without further information, it's not possible to provide a definitive answer. The training of the deep learning model could have been performed on a separate, unspecified hardware setup.
