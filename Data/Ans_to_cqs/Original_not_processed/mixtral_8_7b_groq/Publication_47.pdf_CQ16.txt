Answer: The text provided does not give specific details on the criteria used to determine when training of the IUC-NN model is complete. However, it does mention that cross-validation was performed by shifting the validation set 5 times to quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy. This suggests that one possible criterion for determining training completion could be when the validation loss plateaus or shows only minimal improvement over a certain number of iterations. Additionally, the authors used the neural network with the lowest cross-entropy loss across a range of models with different numbers of hidden layers and subsets of features. This implies that the training process may have also involved early stopping, where training is halted if the model's performance on a validation set stops improving, even if the training loss is still decreasing. However, these are inferences based on the information given, and the specific criteria used for training completion are not explicitly stated in the text.
