The specific deep learning frameworks used in the studies described are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The studies primarily focus on the application and performance of the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model in various scenarios, such as land use/land cover classification, forest type categorization, and predicting forest fire vulnerability.

However, it is important to note that XGBoost is not a deep learning framework itself, but rather a popular machine learning algorithm known for its effectiveness in gradient boosting. Common deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Caffe, among others.

In the context provided, the researchers used XGBoost to classify land use/land cover and forest types, achieving high accuracy in their respective studies. While the authors mentioned the use of deep learning models for object recognition and categorization, they did not specify which deep learning frameworks were used.

In summary, the provided context does not contain enough information to determine which deep learning frameworks were used in the studies. TensorFlow, PyTorch, or other deep learning frameworks could have been used to build the deep learning models, but this information is not explicitly stated.
