The provided context does not give specific information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some data collection and processing methods that were used in a particular study.

In the study, the authors collected flux tower data for various variables such as Respiration (RE), Net Solar Radiation (NSR), Air Temperature (TA), Wind Speed (WS), Relative Humidity (RH), and Precipitation (P) from the G.B. Pant National Institute of Himalayan Environment in India. They used 100 surrogates and a significance level of 1% to compute the network considering lagged information from 1 to 12 hours (Ï„ = 1 to 12, i.e., 6 h).

The data availability statement mentions that the half-hour temporal resolution flux tower data for all variables used in the study is available with Dr. Sandipan Mukherjee and the competent authorities of the institute. However, the post-2016 flux tower data was not available to the researchers, which constrained their study to a period spanning two years, specifically from December 2014 to November 2016.

Based on this information, we can infer that the data collection for this study was limited to the available data from the flux tower. The authors did not mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

Therefore,

Answer::: The provided context does not give specific information about the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.
