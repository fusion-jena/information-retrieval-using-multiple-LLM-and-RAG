Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, there are some implicit clues that can help us infer part of the process.

Firstly, it is mentioned that the model can be transferred to very high spatial resolution images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the automatic identification of specific individuals (Further research could increase the performance and variety of species identified by our CNN-model. For instance, the model could be improved by increasing the number of samples and variety of atmospheric and sea conditions in the training datasets, by building hierarchical training datasets with different behaviour across different species67, by using more spectral bands and temporal information68, and by artificially increasing the spatial resolution of the images through rendering69). This suggests that the model was designed to be flexible and portable, which implies that model serialization was likely used to save and load the model. Model serialization is the process of converting a trained model into a file that can be stored and loaded again, allowing the model to be deployed in different platforms.

Secondly, it is mentioned that the model was built using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (For instance, the model could be improved by increasing the number of samples and variety of atmospheric and sea conditions in the training datasets, by building hierarchical training datasets with different behaviour across different species67, by using more spectral bands and temporal information68, and by artificially increasing the spatial resolution of the images through rendering69). CNNs are a type of deep learning model that are widely used in computer vision tasks, and they can be implemented in different platforms, such as CPUs, GPUs, and specialized hardware for deep learning. Therefore, platform selection was likely an important consideration when deploying the model.

In summary, while there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, the implicit clues suggest that model serialization and platform selection were important considerations. Model serialization allows the model to be stored and loaded again, making it portable and flexible, while platform selection allows the model to be implemented in different hardware, such as CPUs, GPUs, and specialized hardware for deep learning.
