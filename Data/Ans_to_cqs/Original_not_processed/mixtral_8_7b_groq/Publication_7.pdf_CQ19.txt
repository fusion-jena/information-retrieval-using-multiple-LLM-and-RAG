Answer:

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) used to build the model. However, it does give some insight into the methods and techniques used in the development of the deep learning model for marine image annotation.

The model utilizes deep neural networks, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are composed of multiple layers of processing involving linear as well as non-linear operators. The parameters of these networks are learned in an end-to-end manner to solve a particular task. Image representations extracted from deep CNNs, trained on a large dataset such as ImageNet, have shown promising performance for diverse classification and recognition tasks.

Furthermore, the authors mention the use of spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) and Multi-scale Orderless Pooling (MOP) schemes, which have made CNNs independent of the input image size and robust for diverse classification and recognition applications.

In summary, while the specific deep learning framework is not specified, the context suggests that the model is built using deep neural networks, particularly convolutional neural networks, with spatial pyramid pooling and Multi-scale Orderless Pooling techniques for image size independence and robustness.
