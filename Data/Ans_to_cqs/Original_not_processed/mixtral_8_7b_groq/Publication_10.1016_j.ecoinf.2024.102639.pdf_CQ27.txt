Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. However, we can infer some parts of the process based on the context.

The text mentions that the SVM model was trained on a dimensionally reduced dataset, with hyperparameters refined using grid search and cross-validation. This process would result in a trained SVM model, but there is no information on how this model was deployed or integrated into an animal behavior study.

There is also a reference to the integration of machine learning and deep learning methodologies in animal behavior studies, aiming to forecast behavioral patterns and map animals' movement trajectories. However, the text does not provide details on how these models were deployed or implemented in such studies.

Therefore, while we can infer that a deep learning model was trained using certain techniques, there is no explicit information on how this model was deployed or integrated into an animal behavior study.
