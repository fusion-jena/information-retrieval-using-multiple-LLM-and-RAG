Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling within the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, text mining, and the use of pre-trained models like Word2vec and BERT for text classification and semantic analysis.

Data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in computer vision tasks to increase the size of the training dataset and prevent overfitting. These techniques involve creating modified versions of the original images by applying transformations such as horizontal flipping, vertical flipping, rotation, scaling, and more.

However, the context provided does not discuss any computer vision tasks or deep learning pipelines that would require these data augmentation techniques. Instead, it focuses on NLP techniques and text analysis using social media data.
