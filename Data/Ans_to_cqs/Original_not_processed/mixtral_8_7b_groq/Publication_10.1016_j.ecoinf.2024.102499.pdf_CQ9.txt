Answer:::

Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The context discusses the use of various datasets, such as the COCO dataset, to prepare the first layers of the model and train it on a custom dataset of shark and non-shark species. However, it does not specify where these datasets or the trained models can be accessed. Common data repositories for such information include Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF. It is possible that the data repository is privately held or will be made available in the future. For a more definitive answer, it would be best to contact the authors directly.
