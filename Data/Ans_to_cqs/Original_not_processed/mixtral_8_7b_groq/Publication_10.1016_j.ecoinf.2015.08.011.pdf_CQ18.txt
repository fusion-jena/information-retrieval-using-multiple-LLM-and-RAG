Answer:::

In the study, a strategy was implemented to monitor the model performance during the training of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for predicting mosquito abundances. This strategy involved the use of a trial-and-error method to determine the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer and the optimal learning rate, as well as the application of an early stopping technique to prevent overfitting.

The trial-and-error method was used to find the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer and the optimal learning rate, which resulted in the best model performance as indicated by the minimum Mean Square Error (MSE) between the model output and the measured data. Specifically, the number of nodes in the hidden layer was varied between 5 and 23, and the learning rate was varied from 0.01 to 1.0 in increments of 0.05. For each configuration, the MSE was calculated, and the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the optimal learning rate were selected based on the minimum MSE.

Additionally, an early stopping technique was employed to prevent overfitting during the training process. This technique involved randomly splitting the dataset into two sets: 80% for model training and 20% for model testing. The model weights were randomly initialized, and the training process was stopped when the network began to overfit the data, i.e., the error on the validation set started to increase.

These strategies allowed for the monitoring of the model performance during the training of the ANN, and the selection of the optimal number of neurons in the hidden layer, the optimal learning rate, and the prevention of overfitting, resulting in a robust and generalizable model for predicting mosquito abundances.
