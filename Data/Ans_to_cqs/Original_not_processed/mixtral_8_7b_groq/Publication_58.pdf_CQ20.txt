Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning models. It mentions the use of deep learning techniques for land use (LU) detection and classification, and describes the training process, including the use of stochastic gradient descent and the median frequency balancing method. However, it does not specify the type of hardware used for training the models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
