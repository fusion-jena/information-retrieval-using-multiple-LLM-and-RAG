Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the methodology and results of a study that used deep learning techniques for reconstructing damaged leaves of herbarium specimens. It explains the classification model used, the proposed model for reconstructing damaged leaves, and the dataset compiled for training and testing machine learning techniques. However, it does not mention any data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
