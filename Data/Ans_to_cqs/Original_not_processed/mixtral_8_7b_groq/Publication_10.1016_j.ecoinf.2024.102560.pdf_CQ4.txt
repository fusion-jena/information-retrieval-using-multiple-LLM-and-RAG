The provided pieces of context do not directly discuss data augmentation techniques applied in deep learning pipelines such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. However, they do discuss the use of data decomposition and the application of artificial neural networks in analyzing environmental data.

In the context of the Empirical Wavelets Transform (EWT) technique used for signal decomposition, the raw signals are broken down into more stationary and regular subseries. This process can be seen as a form of data transformation, but it is not equivalent to data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning.

In the study by Rahimi and Breuste (2021), an artificial neural network was used to model the drying up of Lake Urmia. However, the context does not provide information on whether data augmentation techniques were applied in their deep learning pipeline.

In summary, while the provided context discusses the use of data transformation techniques and artificial neural networks in analyzing environmental data, it does not directly address the data augmentation techniques applied in deep learning pipelines such as flipping, rotating, or scaling.
