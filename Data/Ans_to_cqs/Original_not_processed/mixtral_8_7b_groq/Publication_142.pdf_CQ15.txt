The provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline of the Pl@ntNet classifier. However, it is mentioned that the deep learning models used are developed with training datasets and their performances are strongly correlated to the quality and completeness of these datasets. This implies that some form of optimization technique is being used to train the models, as this is a standard practice in deep learning.

Common optimization techniques used in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, and Adam. These techniques are used to minimize the loss function of the model during training, allowing the model to learn from the training data.

Without further information, it is not possible to say for certain which optimization technique was used in the Pl@ntNet deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the Pl@ntNet classifier uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with an inception model extended with batch normalization, and that the network is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on Pl@ntNet data. This suggests that the optimization technique used is one that is well-suited for training CNNs, such as SGD or Adam.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the Pl@ntNet deep learning pipeline, it is likely that a standard optimization technique for training CNNs, such as SGD or Adam, was used.
