Answer:::

The text does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the researchers used social media platforms as a source of data. Specifically, they collected relevant reviews with images from Weibo, Dianping, and Ctrip platforms for 57 traditional villages. After cleaning and removing irrelevant data, they obtained 3694 social media data entries with photographs. This suggests that the researchers utilized web scraping or an API to gather data from these platforms.

It's important to note that the use of social media data for this study is not arbitrary. Instead, it aligns with the research objectives, which involve analyzing the physical environment of traditional villages through the lens of users' perceptions and experiences. By using social media data, the researchers can gather firsthand accounts of individuals' experiences with these villages, along with images that provide visual context.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly state the methods used for collecting raw data, it can be inferred that the researchers used web scraping or an API to gather social media data from Weibo, Dianping, and Ctrip platforms.
