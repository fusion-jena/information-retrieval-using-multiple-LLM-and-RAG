Answer:::
The provided context does not give information about a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline, such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context does mention that there are supplementary materials available, including notebooks used to define and train the unstained/stained CNN and the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN. These materials are available for download as Mathematica notebooks and annotated PDFs. However, there is no mention of a data repository for the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that the data used in the pipeline is not publicly available or hosted on a different platform.
