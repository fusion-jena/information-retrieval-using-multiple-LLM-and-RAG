The provided context discusses the use of the Footprint Identification Technology (FIT) for estimating tiger populations and monitoring tiger ranges, rather than techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general information about data bias reduction techniques that could be applicable to various data analysis scenarios.

Data bias can be addressed during preprocessing using several techniques, such as:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into homogeneous subgroups (strata) based on specific criteria, and then randomly sampling an equal number of samples from each stratum. This ensures that the training and test sets have a similar distribution of samples, reducing bias.
2. Oversampling: When the dataset is imbalanced, with one class having significantly more samples than another, oversampling can be used to increase the number of samples in the minority class. This can be done by randomly duplicating samples from the minority class or using techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate synthetic samples.
3. Undersampling: Alternatively, when the dataset is imbalanced, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of samples in the majority class. This can be done by randomly removing samples from the majority class or using techniques like NearMiss to select a subset of the majority class that is closest to the minority class.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from various sources, ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help reduce bias by ensuring that the dataset includes samples from all relevant subgroups.

In the context of the FIT algorithm, data validation was performed on the captive Amur tiger dataset to determine the optimal number of footprint trails required for the algorithm training set and test sets. The analysis was iterated multiple times for each combination of test/training size, with randomly selected trails, to examine how the predicted outcome compared with the known test set size. This approach can help ensure that the dataset is representative and that the algorithm is not biased towards specific subgroups.
