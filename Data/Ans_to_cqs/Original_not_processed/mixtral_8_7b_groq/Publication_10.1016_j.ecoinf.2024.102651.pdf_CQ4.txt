Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses various aspects of a deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a CA-Hybrid network based on CNN and ViT modules, the introduction of Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to improve classification accuracy, and the comparison of classification performance between small and medium objects. However, it does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional context.
