Answer: The text provided describes the use of a class-weighted technique to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. This method involves calculating the weights for each class based on the number of instances in each class using the 'compute\_class\_weights' function from the sklearn library in Python. These calculated weights are then used as inputs during model training to give more importance to the minority classes. This approach is different from stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling techniques. Stratified sampling ensures that the train and test sets have approximately the same percentage of samples of each target class as the complete set. Oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class to balance the dataset, while undersampling reduces the number of samples from the majority class. Diverse data collection aims to gather a wide variety of data to ensure that the dataset is representative of the real-world scenario. In this case, the authors use a class-weighted technique to address data bias.
