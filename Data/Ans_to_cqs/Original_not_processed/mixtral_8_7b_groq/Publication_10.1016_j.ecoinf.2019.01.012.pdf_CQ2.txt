Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in the context of image classification. Therefore, it primarily focuses on the use of image data formats in the deep learning pipeline.

The images used in this study are digital photographs, which are likely in a raster format such as JPEG or PNG. To prepare the images for training the CNN, they are first manually labeled as either "woody vegetation" or "non-woody vegetation" and then split into 50 × 50 pixel tiles. These tiles are used as the input data for training the CNN.

During the training process, the CNN learns and extracts relevant features from the image tiles without the need for separate feature extraction. The trained classifier is then applied to whole repeat photographs, which are also split into 50 × 50 pixel tiles. The classifier predicts the output for each single tile and reassembles them to the original image size.

For evaluation purposes, the photographs are also classified manually by overlaying each photograph and labeling the vegetation type.

In summary, the provided context suggests that image data formats are primarily used in this deep learning pipeline. The images are in a raster format, and they are split into smaller tiles for training and prediction. There is no mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV.
