Answer:::

The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved model serialization and platform selection. The model was trained using a deep convolutional neural network for the purpose of background subtraction, specifically for hummingbird detection in time-lapse camera data. After training the model, it was serialized, making it ready for deployment.

The researcher used TensorFlow, an open-source software library for machine intelligence, to build and train the model. TensorFlow provides the functionality to save the trained model to a disk, allowing the model to be used in different environments. The model was serialized using TensorFlow's built-in function, which saves the model's architecture, learned weights, and biases into a single file.

For platform selection, the researcher chose to deploy the model as a DeepMeerkat executable for Mac and Windows, along with cloud systems. DeepMeerkat is a graphical user interface (GUI) designed for deploying machine learning models for video analysis. The researcher utilized the pre-trained model in the DeepMeerkat GUI, which allows users to select a file or directory of videos to screen using the trained model.

In addition, the researcher provided reproducible scripts for local and Google cloud environments to allow users to train new models. These scripts can be used to train the model with custom data, and the trained models can be deployed using the DeepMeerkat GUI.

The researcher also collected images for each class and trained a fine-tuned neural network using these images. The feature vectors for the frozen layers were extracted in parallel using Google Cloud DataFlow and then used as the basis for retraining the new fine-tuned layers. This process allowed for the creation of a customized model tailored for hummingbird detection.

In summary, the researcher followed a process of model serialization and platform selection to deploy the trained deep learning model. The model was serialized using TensorFlow and deployed as a DeepMeerkat executable for Mac and Windows, along with cloud systems. Additionally, reproducible scripts were provided for training new models with custom data, allowing for flexible deployment options.
