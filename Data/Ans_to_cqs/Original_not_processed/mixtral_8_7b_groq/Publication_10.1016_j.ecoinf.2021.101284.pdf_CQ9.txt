Unfortunately, based on the provided context, there is no information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. The context includes references to various studies and reports, but it does not mention the data repository or where it can be found. It is possible that the data repository is not publicly available or was not specified in the sources consulted. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
