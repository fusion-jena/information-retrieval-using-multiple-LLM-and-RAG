The provided context does not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in deep learning pipelines. However, it does mention the use of Random Forests (RF), a machine learning technique, for classifying reproductive conditions in fish. RF is an ensemble learning method that can be considered a type of shallow learning due to its decision trees-based nature. It is not a deep learning algorithm, which typically involves multiple layers of artificial neural networks.

In the context of machine learning, randomness can be handled in various ways, such as:

1. Initialization of weights: Random initialization of weights is a common practice in neural networks to ensure that different neurons have different initial conditions. This helps break symmetry and allows the network to learn different features.
2. Dropout: Dropout is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in neural networks. During training, dropout randomly "drops" a proportion of neurons from the network, effectively making the network smaller and less prone to overfitting.
3. Data shuffling: Shuffling the training dataset before each epoch can help ensure that the model does not learn patterns specific to the order of the data.
4. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance of machine learning models. It involves dividing the dataset into k-folds, training the model on k-1 folds, and testing it on the remaining fold. This process is repeated k times, and the average performance is calculated.

While the provided context does not discuss deep learning, the mentioned machine learning techniques can help manage randomness and improve model performance. However, for deep learning-specific strategies, further resources would be required.
