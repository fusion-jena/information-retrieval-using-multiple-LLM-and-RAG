Answer:

The context provided does not directly answer the query regarding the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide information on how spectral reflectance data is processed and used in estimating soil organic carbon and total nitrogen (TN).

From the context, it can be inferred that the raw data is collected using a spectrometer, as mentioned in Bai et al. (2022) and Bartholomeus et al. (2008). The spectrometer is used to measure the reflectance of soil samples, and the number of spectral bars saved for each sample is 15. The average value is taken as the spectral reflectance of the soil samples.

In addition, the context also provides information on the use of pre-processing techniques such as ViewSpecPro and The Unscrambler for data pre-processing. These pre-processing techniques are likely applied to the raw spectral reflectance data collected by the spectrometer.

Furthermore, the context also provides information on the use of partial least squares regression (PLSR) for estimating soil organic carbon and TN using the pre-processed spectral reflectance data. The important bands for TN estimation by PLSR are listed in Table 3 of the context.

In summary, while the context does not directly answer the query regarding the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that raw spectral reflectance data is collected using a spectrometer. Pre-processing techniques are then applied to the raw data, and PLSR is used for estimating soil organic carbon and TN using the pre-processed spectral reflectance data.
