Answer:::

The deep learning models in the study were trained using a Windows 10 machine with 2 CPUs, each having 2.60 GHz and 4 cores. Additionally, a GPU NVIDIA Quadro M1000M was also used for training. Specifically, the mxnet package, which was used to fit the SNN, DNN, and CNN models, is a C++ library for learning deep neural network models and is deployed as an R package. It integrates a high level symbolic language for quickly building customized models and loss functions, and automatically distributes calculations under CPUs or GPUs. This suggests that the training of the deep learning models was done using both the CPU and GPU resources.

The LGL model was also fitted using the mxnet package, and the loss being convex, a simple gradient descent algorithm was used. The learning took around 2 minutes, but it is not specified whether it was trained using the CPU or GPU. However, since the mxnet package supports automatic distribution of calculations under CPUs or GPUs, it is possible that the LGL model was also trained using both the CPU and GPU resources.

It is worth noting that the training times for the SNN, DNN, and CNN models were significantly different, with the SNN taking 5 minutes, the DNN taking 10 minutes, and the CNN taking 5 hours. This difference in training time could be due to the complexity of the models, the amount of data, and the hardware resources used for training. However, the text does not provide specific information on how the training time was affected by the use of CPU or GPU resources.
