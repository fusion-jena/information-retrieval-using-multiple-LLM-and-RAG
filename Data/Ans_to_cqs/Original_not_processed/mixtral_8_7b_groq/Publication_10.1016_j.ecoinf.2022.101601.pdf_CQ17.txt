Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general information about common regularization techniques that are often used in deep learning.

Regularization is a crucial step in deep learning to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model learns the training data too well, to the point where it performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization methods work by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data that may not generalize well.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are L2 regularization and dropout.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This penalty term encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which in turn reduces the complexity of the model and helps prevent overfitting.

Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the model's outputs to zero during training. This has the effect of preventing the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron, which helps to reduce overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention the specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, L2 regularization and dropout are two common techniques that are often used for this purpose.
