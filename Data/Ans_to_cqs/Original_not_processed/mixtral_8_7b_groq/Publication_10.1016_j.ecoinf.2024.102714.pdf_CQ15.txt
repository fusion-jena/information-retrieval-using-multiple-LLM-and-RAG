Answer:::
The provided context does not give information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context could be referring to the machine learning (ML) algorithm implemented using XGBoostClassifier. However, the specific optimization techniques used in this ML algorithm, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam, are not mentioned. The ML algorithm uses a python implementation of XGBoostClassifier, which is based on optimized random trees, where each new tree learns from the errors of those previous. As input to the ML algorithm, the seasonal vegetation index composites from S2, backscatter composites from S1, elevation, and slope are used, totaling up to 54 features. But, the optimization techniques used during the training of this ML model are not provided in the context.
