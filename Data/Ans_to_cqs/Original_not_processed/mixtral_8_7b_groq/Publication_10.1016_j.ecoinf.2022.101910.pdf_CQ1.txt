Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline for bird species detection and classification, as exemplified by the BirdNET project, utilizes passive acoustic monitoring for collecting raw data. Passive acoustic monitoring involves the use of sound recorders, such as the Audiomoth, to capture bird vocalizations from the environment. These recorders can be deployed in various settings, such as potential wetlands, to monitor vocally active taxa.

The Audiomoth is a low-cost and open-source sound recorder, making it accessible for researchers and managers without extensive financial resources or specialized technical expertise. The use of the Audiomoth for monitoring the Eurasian bittern, a threatened and patchily distributed species, has been evaluated in north Spain. This specific application demonstrates the potential of the Audiomoth for monitoring target species in their natural habitats.

In addition to the Audiomoth, other survey methods can be used to collect raw data for the deep learning pipeline. Traditional bird data censuses, such as surveys, can affect the probability of detecting and identifying bird vocalizations on recordings. However, these methods can still provide valuable data for training and validating deep learning models.

Furthermore, public datasets can also be utilized for the deep learning pipeline. With the increasing accessibility of user-friendly and ready-to-use machine learning approaches, integrating public datasets can enhance the robustness and generalizability of the models. These datasets can contain bird vocalizations from various species, habitats, and geographical locations, contributing to the development of more versatile and accurate deep learning models for bird species detection and classification.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline for bird species detection and classification utilizes passive acoustic monitoring, survey methods like traditional bird data censuses, and public datasets for collecting raw data. These methods ensure the availability of diverse and representative data for training and validating deep learning models, ultimately improving their performance in real-life monitoring challenges and benefiting the general public and ornithology research.
