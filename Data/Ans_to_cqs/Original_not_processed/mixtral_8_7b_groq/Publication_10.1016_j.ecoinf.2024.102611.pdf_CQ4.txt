Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling that were applied in the deep learning pipelines. However, the context does discuss the development and application of deep learning models for plant leaf recognition and disease detection.

Data augmentation is a common technique used in deep learning to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset by applying various transformations to the existing images. Flipping, rotating, and scaling are examples of such transformations that can help improve the model's performance and robustness.

In the context of plant leaf classification, data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling can be helpful to account for variations in leaf appearance due to factors such as lighting conditions, viewpoint, and natural deformations. By applying these transformations, the deep learning model can learn to recognize and classify leaves more accurately, even when they appear in different orientations or scales.

For instance, in the study by Azadnia et al. (2022), the authors used a deep CNN based on global average pooling for medicinal plant identification. They might have employed data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of their training dataset and improve the model's performance. Similarly, in the study by Barhate et al. (2023), the authors used a hybrid deep learning approach for plant species identification. They could have utilized data augmentation techniques to enhance their model's ability to handle variations in leaf appearance.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipelines, it is common practice to use techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling to improve the model's performance and robustness in plant leaf recognition and disease detection tasks.
