Answer: Based on the provided context, a feed-forward neural network is used in the pipeline for predicting global vegetation cover. This is a type of deep learning model that consists of three layers: an input layer with 47 neurons for each climatic feature, a hidden layer with 40 neurons and sigmoid activation functions, and an output layer with 13 neurons and a softmax function. The softmax function ensures that the outputs of the model sum up to unity, which is a constraint for this particular task. The neural network is trained using the Adam optimizer and the mean absolute error loss function, which is chosen for its robustness to outliers. The Keras library is used for implementing this model. Therefore, a feed-forward neural network is the deep learning model used in this pipeline.
