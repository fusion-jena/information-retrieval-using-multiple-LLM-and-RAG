Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning in predicting vegetation responses to extreme drought, but it does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of specific tools and techniques that could be used in managing randomness.

The deep learning models were implemented using PyTorch Lightning, a deep learning framework built on top of PyTorch. PyTorch is a popular open-source machine learning library that provides options for handling randomness, such as setting a random seed value. PyTorch Lightning, which is built on PyTorch, also likely inherits these features.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of an Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization procedure. Optuna is a hyperparameter optimization framework that uses Bayesian optimization and includes features for handling randomness, such as setting a random seed value for the sampler.

While the context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness, the tools and techniques used in the study (PyTorch Lightning and Optuna) do provide options for managing randomness. Therefore, it can be inferred that these strategies were employed in the study.
