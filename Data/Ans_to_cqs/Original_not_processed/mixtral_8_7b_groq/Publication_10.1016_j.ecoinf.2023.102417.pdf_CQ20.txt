Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific details about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mentions that the deep learning model is implemented using the Python library PyTorch, but it does not specify if GPUs, TPUs, or any other specific hardware were used for training. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
