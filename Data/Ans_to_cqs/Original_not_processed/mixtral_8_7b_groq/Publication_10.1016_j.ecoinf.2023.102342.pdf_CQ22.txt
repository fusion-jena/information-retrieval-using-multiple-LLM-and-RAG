Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model, such as accuracy, precision, or recall. However, the context does discuss the use of metrics and evaluation in the context of data mining and ecological informatics.

In the context, metrics are used to evaluate the results of data mining and to determine if the objectives of the study have been achieved. The support metric is discussed as a measure of the frequency or importance of a set of items in a database. In marketing analysis, support can be calculated for antecedents and consequents in association rules.

However, these metrics are specific to data mining and association rule mining, and are not directly applicable to the evaluation of deep learning models. For deep learning models, common metrics used for evaluation include:

* Accuracy: the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made
* Precision: the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made
* Recall: the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances
* F1 score: the harmonic mean of precision and recall
* Area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC): a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative instances

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models in various applications, such as image classification, natural language processing, and time series forecasting. The choice of metrics depends on the specific problem and the business or research objectives.
