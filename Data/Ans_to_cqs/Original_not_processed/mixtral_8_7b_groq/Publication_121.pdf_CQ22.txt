Answer:::
The performance of the deep learning models in this study is evaluated using two primary metrics: accuracy and loss.

Accuracy is a ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total observations. In this context, it measures the percentage of images that are correctly classified by the models. Both the MobileNetV2-based model and the MobileNetV3-based models show impressive training accuracies, with the former reaching 97% and the latter reaching 96%. The validation accuracies are also high, with the MobileNetV2-based model achieving 86% and the MobileNetV3-based model reaching 89%. These accuracy metrics indicate that the models are proficient at classifying the images in the dataset.

Loss, on the other hand, is a measure of the error or discrepancy between the predicted and actual values. It is used to tune the model during the training phase to improve its performance. The study uses sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, which is a common choice for multi-class classification problems. The use of this loss function helps the models to learn and distinguish between different classes in the dataset.

Additionally, the performance of the models is evaluated by calculating the accuracies and losses of the training samples in each epoch. This approach provides insights into how the models' performance changes and improves over time during the training process.

The fine-tuning results further demonstrate the effectiveness of the models, with both models showing improved training accuracies. The MobileNetV2-based model's training accuracy increased to 97%, while the MobileNetV3-based model's training accuracy improved to 96%. The validation accuracy of the MobileNetV2-based model remained at 86%, while the MobileNetV3-based model's validation accuracy increased to 89%. The gap between the training and validation curves for the MobileNetV3-based model is less than that of the MobileNetV2-based model, indicating that the former model has a better fit and is less prone to overfitting.

In summary, the study uses accuracy and loss as the primary metrics to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models. These metrics provide valuable insights into the models' ability to classify images accurately and to minimize the error or discrepancy between the predicted and actual values.
