Answer:::
The Res_AUNet network, a deep learning model for water sun glint detection in UAV water images, was trained on a Dell workstation with specific hardware resources. The workstation was equipped with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6248R CPU (3.00GHz) and 512GB of memory. Additionally, the training process utilized an NVIDIA RTX A6000 graphics card, which has 48GB of memory and is a type of GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). The use of a GPU for training the model is a common practice in deep learning due to its ability to perform parallel processing, which significantly accelerates the training process compared to using a CPU alone. Therefore, the provided context indicates that a GPU, specifically the NVIDIA RTX A6000, was used for training the Res_AUNet network.
