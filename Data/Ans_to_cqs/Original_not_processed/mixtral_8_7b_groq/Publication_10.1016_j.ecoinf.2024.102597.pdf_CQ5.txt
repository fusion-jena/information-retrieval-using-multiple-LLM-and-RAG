Answer:

The provided context does not give information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. It mentions that deep learning algorithms were considered in a study related to water quality prediction, but the limited number of samples was not conducive to deep learning. However, it does not specify which datasets were used.

The context mainly focuses on the application of machine learning and other algorithms in estimating water quality parameters (WQP) using remote sensing data. Researchers have used various machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), neural network models, and ensemble learning models for estimating WQP. For instance, Li et al. established an SVM model to estimate Chla concentrations in 45 typical lakes in China, and Muhammad et al. developed a neural network model called the Ocean Color Network (OGN) to estimate Chla concentrations in the Barents Sea.

The context also mentions the use of Landsat satellites and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) for estimating WQP. However, it notes that when applied to small to medium-sized water bodies, issues such as insufficient spatial resolution and mixed pixels cannot be avoided. Hyperspectral data have great potential for estimating WQP.

The study used an integrated development environment based on Python and Anaconda to complete the construction, training, testing, and hyperparameter optimization of all models. The Scikit-learn library was used for RF and GBDT, while XGBoost, LGBM, and CatBoost were implemented through the Scikit-learn API interfaces.

Therefore, while the context provides valuable information about the application of machine learning and other algorithms in estimating WQP, it does not give specific details about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline.
