Answer:::

The provided context discusses the training of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for species classification, but it does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps applied to the data before training the models. However, it can be inferred that some preprocessing steps were taken based on common practices in deep learning.

Normalization is a common preprocessing step in deep learning, which involves scaling the input data to a range between 0 and 1. This is often necessary because neural networks are sensitive to the scale of the input features. Although not explicitly stated in the context, it is highly likely that the moths dataset was normalized before training the CNN models.

Scaling is another preprocessing step that may have been applied to the data. While normalization scales the data to a specific range, scaling involves transforming the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This can help the model converge faster during training.

Cleaning the data is also an important preprocessing step that may have been taken before training the models. Cleaning the data involves removing any irrelevant or missing values from the dataset. Although not explicitly mentioned in the context, it is assumed that the moths dataset was cleaned before training the models.

Data augmentation is another preprocessing step that was explicitly mentioned in the context. Data augmentation involves creating new synthetic samples from the existing data by applying random transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping. This can help increase the size of the training dataset and reduce overfitting.

Therefore, based on common practices in deep learning and the information provided in the context, it can be inferred that the moths dataset was normalized, scaled, cleaned, and augmented before training the CNN models.
