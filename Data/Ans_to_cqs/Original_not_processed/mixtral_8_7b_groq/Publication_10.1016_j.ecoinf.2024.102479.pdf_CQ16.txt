Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the models. However, it does mention that k-fold cross-validation was used for model evaluation and assessment, and that the training and testing datasets were split 70-30. This suggests that the training process might include monitoring the performance of the model on the testing dataset or a validation set during the training process, and stopping the training when the performance on this validation set stops improving or starts to degrade. This is a common approach to prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well to new data.

In addition, the context also provides information about the hyperparameter tuning process, where Grid Search with Cross-Validation (GSCV) was used to identify the most effective set of hyperparameters that enhance the model's performance. This process involves systematically training and assessing the performance of various models through cross-validation, and selecting the model that demonstrates the most superior performance, determined by its optimal hyperparameter combination. The hyperparameters and their ranges for each algorithm are provided in Table 1, which suggests that the training process might also involve searching for the best combination of hyperparameters that result in the best performance on the validation set.

Overall, while the context does not provide specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, it suggests that the training process might involve monitoring the performance on a validation set and searching for the best hyperparameters using GSCV.
