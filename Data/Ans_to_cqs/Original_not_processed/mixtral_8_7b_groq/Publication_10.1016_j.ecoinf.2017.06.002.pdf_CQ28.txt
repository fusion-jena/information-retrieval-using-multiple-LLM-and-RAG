Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information about the deployment of a deep learning model or any platform (such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform) used for such deployment. The context focuses on the description of FRAMES, a framework for reporting data and metadata for earth systems, and the NGEE Tropics Archive, the project's data repository.

The FRAMES framework includes metadata templates for data originators to enter measurement setting descriptions and data file descriptions. The metadata includes details like data package names and descriptions, site and plot information, authors, institutions, citations, acknowledgements, and funding sources, as well as QA/QC status. The NGEE Tropics Archive is a data repository that manages data packages and has a web portal for data originators to upload and download data packages. The Archive is built on the Django Python web application framework and the Foundation front-end framework.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the platform used for deploying a deep learning model.
