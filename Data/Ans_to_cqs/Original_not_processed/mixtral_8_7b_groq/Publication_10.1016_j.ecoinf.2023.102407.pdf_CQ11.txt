Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about a data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context includes several papers and studies related to machine learning, ecology, and species distribution modeling, but none of them explicitly mention a data repository link for a deep learning pipeline.

It is important to note that data repository links are often provided in the Methods or Data Availability sections of research papers. However, in this case, the context does not contain enough information to answer the query.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to a data repository for a deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
