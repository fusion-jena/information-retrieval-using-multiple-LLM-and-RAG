Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline can utilize various data formats, including images, videos, audio, and structured data such as CSV files.

Images are commonly used in deep learning tasks, such as object detection and image segmentation. For instance, Liu et al. (2016) presented the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD), an image detection algorithm. Similarly, Liu, J., et al. (2023a) developed a deep residual convolutional neural network based on YOLOv5 for object detection in images.

Videos, which are essentially a sequence of images, are used in applications like action recognition and wildlife monitoring. Schindler and Steinhage (2021) used deep learning techniques for identifying animals and recognizing their actions in wildlife videos. Schneider et al. (2018) applied deep learning object detection methods for ecological camera trap data.

Audio data is used in tasks like acoustic chimpanzee detection. Anders et al. (2021) compensated for class imbalance in acoustic chimpanzee detection using convolutional recurrent neural networks.

Structured data, such as CSV files, are used in various applications. For example, A.Y. (2021) employed an automated deep learning-based satellite imagery analysis for ecology management, which likely involves processing structured data.

In summary, deep learning pipelines can handle various data formats, including images, videos, audio, and structured data like CSV files. The choice of data format depends on the specific task and application.
