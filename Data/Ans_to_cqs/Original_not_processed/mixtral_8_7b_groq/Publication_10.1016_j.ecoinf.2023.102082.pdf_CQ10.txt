Answer:::

 The provided context does not include information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used to create the Lang10m high-resolution CHM of the Earth. The context includes details about the dataset, study area, and methods used to create the Lang10m dataset, but it does not mention the code repository or where to find the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
