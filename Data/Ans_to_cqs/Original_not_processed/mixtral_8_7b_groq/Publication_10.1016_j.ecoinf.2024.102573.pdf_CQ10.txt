Answer:::

I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the progress and methods used in bird species recognition tasks, particularly those using deep learning and bioacoustic analysis. It discusses various techniques such as using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Constant-Q Transform (CQT), and SincNet for feature extraction before training neural networks. However, it does not mention or provide a link to any code repository for this pipeline.
