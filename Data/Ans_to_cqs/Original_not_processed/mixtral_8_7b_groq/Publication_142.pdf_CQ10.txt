Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline for Pl@ntNet is not explicitly mentioned to have a dedicated code repository link, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. However, there is an R-package called 'plantnet' available at <https://github.com/BiologicalRecordsCentre/plantnet> which facilitates the implementation of future studies based on the Pl@ntNet API. This package might include parts of the deep learning pipeline, but it does not contain the entire pipeline since the Pl@ntNet classification tool's training requires high-performance computing infrastructure and expertise in deep, distributed, and large-scale learning.

Additionally, there is a photosearcher R package (<https://docs.ropensci.org/photosearcher/>) that allows users to search images for a given taxon using the Pl@ntNet API. This package can be used to understand how the Pl@ntNet API is being accessed and utilized in R.

In summary, while there is no explicit code repository link for the entire deep learning pipeline of Pl@ntNet, there are R packages available that can help you understand and utilize the Pl@ntNet API.
