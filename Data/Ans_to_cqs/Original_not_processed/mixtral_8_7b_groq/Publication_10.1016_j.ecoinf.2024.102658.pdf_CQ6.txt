Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is a specific mention of feature scaling as a preprocessing step for the dataset. Feature scaling, also known as data normalization, is the process of transforming features to have a common range, in this case [0,1], while retaining the shape of the original distribution. This is typically done using min-max scaling, where the minimum value of each feature is subtracted from each value, and then the result is divided by the range of the feature.

However, the context does not explicitly mention other preprocessing steps such as data cleaning or normalization for a deep learning model. Data cleaning involves handling missing or inconsistent data, while normalization is the process of transforming data to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. These preprocessing steps are crucial for the success of deep learning models, as they help to ensure that the model can learn effectively from the data.

Therefore, while the context provides information on feature scaling as a preprocessing step, it does not cover other important preprocessing steps such as data cleaning and normalization. It is assumed that these steps were also performed, but they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
