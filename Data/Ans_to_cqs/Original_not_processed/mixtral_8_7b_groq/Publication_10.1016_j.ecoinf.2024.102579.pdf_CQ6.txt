The provided context does not discuss deep learning model preprocessing steps directly. However, it does mention the use of the NN1, NN2, NN3, and NN4 estimators in the context of forestry and ecological informatics. Although not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that some preprocessing steps were taken before using these estimators.

In the context of machine learning and deep learning, preprocessing steps often include data cleaning, normalization, and scaling. Data cleaning involves handling missing or incorrect data points. Normalization and scaling are used to adjust the range of input features so that the model can learn effectively.

For the NN1, NN2, NN3, and NN4 estimators mentioned in the context, preprocessing might involve:

1. Data cleaning: Ensuring that the input data is accurate and free from errors, such as missing or inconsistent values.
2. Feature scaling: Adjusting the range of input features so that they are on a similar scale. This can help the model learn more effectively, as features with very different scales can dominate the learning process.
3. Weight calculation: Calculating the weights for sample trees and their neighbors, as described in the context. This is an essential preprocessing step for the NN3 and NN4 estimators.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention preprocessing steps for deep learning models, it can be inferred that some preprocessing, such as data cleaning, feature scaling, and weight calculation, was performed before using the NN1, NN2, NN3, and NN4 estimators.
