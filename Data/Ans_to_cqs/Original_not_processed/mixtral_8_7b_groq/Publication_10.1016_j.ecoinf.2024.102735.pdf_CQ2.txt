Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline can use various data formats, including CSV files. In the study by Busari et al. (2024), a dataset containing water quality parameters such as temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, pH, and chlorophyll-a was used to predict harmful algal blooms (HABs). This data was collected at different times of the day and stored in a CSV file format. Similarly, Cen et al. (2022) used a dataset in CSV format to predict chlorophyll-a concentration in the East China Sea using deep learning.

While CSV files are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, other data formats such as images, audio, and video can also be used. For instance, in image recognition tasks, deep learning models can use image files in formats such as JPEG, PNG, or TIFF. Similarly, in audio and video processing, deep learning models can use audio files in formats such as WAV or MP3 and video files in formats such as MP4 or AVI.

It is worth noting that the data format used in a deep learning pipeline depends on the specific problem being addressed. For instance, in natural language processing tasks, text data is typically used, while in time series forecasting, time-series data is used.

To preprocess the data for deep learning, various techniques can be used, including data cleaning, normalization, and augmentation. Data cleaning involves removing or correcting erroneous or missing data points, while normalization involves scaling the data to a common range to improve model convergence. Data augmentation involves creating new data points by applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, or flipping to the existing data.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline can use various data formats, including CSV files, image files, audio files, and video files. The specific data format used depends on the problem being addressed, and the data is typically preprocessed before being fed into the deep learning model.
