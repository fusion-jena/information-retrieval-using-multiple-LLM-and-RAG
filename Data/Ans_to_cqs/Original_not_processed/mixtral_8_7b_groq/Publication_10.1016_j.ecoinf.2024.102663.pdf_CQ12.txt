The provided context discusses the use of deep learning techniques for fish biomass estimation, but it does not explicitly mention a specific deep learning model such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer being used in the pipeline. However, it does mention the use of Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings and modifications to the YOLO architecture.

Bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is capable of learning long-term dependencies in data. GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) is a pre-trained word embedding technique that can be used to represent words in a numerical format that can be input into machine learning models.

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection system that is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). The context mentions altering various parts of the YOLO architecture to handle different environmental factors, such as salinity.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the pipeline uses a combination of deep learning models, including a Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings for fish species detection and classification, and a modified YOLO architecture for object detection. However, it is not explicitly stated that a CNN, RNN, or Transformer model is used in isolation.
