Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset. However, it can be inferred that some form of image segmentation was used, as the paper mentions visual representations of features when fine-tuning with raw and segmented images.

Image segmentation is a process of partitioning an image into multiple segments or parts to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze. Instance segmentation, in particular, is a type of image segmentation that aims to identify and segment each instance of an object within an image.

In the context of the Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset, it is likely that instance segmentation was used to separate the leaves from the background and possibly to distinguish between different species of trees. This would enable the deep learning models to learn more specific and relevant features for each leaf image.

However, the paper does not provide any details about the specific tools or methods used for image segmentation. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a more precise answer to the query without additional information.
