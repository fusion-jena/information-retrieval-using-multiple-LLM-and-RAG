Answer:::
The text provided does not give specific information about the deep learning framework used to build the model. It mentions that a Tesla K80 GPU was used for training, but it does not specify whether a framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch was used to build the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this question.
