Answer:::

The deep learning model in the study was trained using two types of hardware resources: Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Central Processing Units (CPUs).

For the GPU-based training, two different setups were used. The first one involved the use of a GPU server with two NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPUs, each having 24 GB GDDR5 Graphics Card. This setup was used for both zero-start training mode and incremental training mode. The second GPU-based setup was on a desktop PC with an NVIDIA GeForce GT 730 GPU, which had 2 GB GDDR5 Graphics Card. This setup was used only for incremental training mode.

For the CPU-based training, a desktop PC with an Intel Core i7-7700 3.6 GHz processor and 32 GB of RAM was used. This setup was also used for incremental training mode.

The study found that the GPU server with Tesla K80 GPUs provided the best performance in terms of recognition rate, followed by the desktop PC with GeForce GT 730 GPU, and then the desktop PC with the Intel Core i7-7700 CPU. However, the time costs and required computing platform for model training were not explicitly compared among the different setups.

It is worth noting that the study mentioned the use of preprocessing techniques, which could have affected the model training time and recognition rate. Specifically, the study mentioned that one possible reason for the lower recognition rate of a previous study could be the complexity of their preprocessing techniques.

In summary, the deep learning model in the study was trained using GPUs and CPUs. The GPU server with Tesla K80 GPUs provided the best performance, followed by the desktop PC with GeForce GT 730 GPU and the desktop PC with Intel Core i7-7700 CPU. The time costs and required computing platform for model training were not explicitly compared among the different setups.
