Answer:::

The generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through several measures, including the use of diverse datasets, stratified sampling, and a specific training strategy.

Firstly, the model was trained on a diverse dataset consisting of bird species from two different sources: BirdCLEF2018 and Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata. These datasets were chosen to include birds of different class sizes, resulting in a varied and representative sample. Specifically, the BirdCLEF2018 dataset was divided into BirdCLEF-Small (BC-S) and BirdCLEF-Large (BC-L), while the Lishui-Zhejiang Birdsdata was reduced to 100 species (LS) and further halved to create a smaller-scale training set (LS*). This approach allowed the model to learn from a wide range of bird species, thereby enhancing its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Secondly, the datasets were split using the stratified sampling method. This technique ensures that each subset (training, validation, and testing) maintains the same distribution of classes as the original dataset. By doing so, the model was exposed to a balanced representation of bird species during training, validation, and testing, further improving its generalizability.

Lastly, the training strategy included several components that contributed to the model's generalizability. The model was trained for 200 epochs using the Adam optimizer with a weight decay of 1 × 10^-4. The batch size was fixed at 16, and the learning rate was initially set at 0.001, then reduced by a factor of 0.1 in a step-wise manner whenever the validation loss remained constant for five epochs. The minimum learning rate was established at 1 × 10^-5. Additionally, the hyper-parameter λ in Eq. (4) was set to 0.8, and β in Eq. (6) was set to 0.4. These settings helped the model converge to an optimal solution and prevented overfitting.

In summary, the generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through the use of diverse datasets, stratified sampling, and a well-designed training strategy. These measures allowed the model to learn from a wide range of bird species, be exposed to a balanced representation of classes, and converge to an optimal solution without overfitting.
