Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses various aspects of a study on spatiotemporal variations in soil degradation, including data collection and the use of factors, sums of squares, and variances in the model. However, it does not mention any specific methods for hyperparameter optimization such as grid search, random search, or others. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
