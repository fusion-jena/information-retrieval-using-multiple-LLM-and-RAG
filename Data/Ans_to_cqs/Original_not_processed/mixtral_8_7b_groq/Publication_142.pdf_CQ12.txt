Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the Pl@ntNet pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is specified in the statement "the CNN architecture used is the inception model49 extended with batch normalization." CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to effectively learn spatial hierarchies of features. The Pl@ntNet CNN is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, a large dataset of images widely used for pre-training CNNs, and then fine-tuned on the Pl@ntNet data. This two-stage training process allows the model to leverage general image features learned from ImageNet, while also specializing for the task of plant species identification. The model's output provides a list of likely species associated with classification scores, as well as matching images retrieved from the database.
