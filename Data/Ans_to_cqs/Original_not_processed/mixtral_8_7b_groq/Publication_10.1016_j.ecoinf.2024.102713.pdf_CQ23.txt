Answer:::
The provided context does not contain information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The text focuses on the description of CASE's database schema, the creation of a multidimensional spatial cube called Captures, and the validation and loading of enriched H. halys captures in the Harbor tier of the data platform.

However, I can provide some general measures that are commonly used to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model:

1. Diverse dataset: Collecting a diverse dataset with a wide range of variations, such as different geographical locations, time periods, and environmental conditions, can help the model learn from various patterns and improve its ability to generalize.
2. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance and generalizability of a model by dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on one subset, and testing it on another. This process is repeated for each subset, providing a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.
3. Stratified splitting: Stratified splitting is a technique used to ensure that the training and testing sets have a similar distribution of classes or labels. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class and improve its ability to generalize.
4. Regularization: Regularization techniques, such as L1 and L2 regularization, can help prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. This encourages the model to learn simpler and more generalizable patterns.
5. Data augmentation: Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size and diversity of the dataset by applying random transformations, such as rotation, scaling, and flipping, to the existing data. This can help the model learn from various variations and improve its ability to generalize.

Therefore, while the provided context does not contain information about the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the aforementioned measures are commonly used to improve the generalizability of deep learning models.
