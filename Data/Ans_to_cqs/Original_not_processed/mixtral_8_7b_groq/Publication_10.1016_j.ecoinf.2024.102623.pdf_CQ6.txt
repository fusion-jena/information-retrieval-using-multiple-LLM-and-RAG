Answer:::

Before training a deep learning model, several preprocessing steps are typically involved to ensure the data's quality and compatibility with the model. These steps include normalization, scaling, and cleaning.

Normalization is the process of rescaling numeric data to a common range, often between 0 and 1. This technique helps the model converge faster during training and prevents exploding or vanishing gradients. In the provided context, normalization is not explicitly mentioned; however, batch normalization is employed, which normalizes the activations of the neurons in a layer for each mini-batch.

Scaling is another preprocessing technique that resizes the data's range to improve the model's performance. While normalization rescales data to a common range, scaling maintains the original distribution's shape. In the context, no scaling technique is explicitly mentioned.

Cleaning refers to the process of handling missing or corrupted data points. In the provided context, the Teng et al. (2023) paper introduces the Satbird dataset, which combines remote sensing and citizen science data for bird species distribution modeling. However, the specific data cleaning techniques are not discussed.

In addition to these preprocessing steps, feature engineering might be required to extract meaningful features from the raw data. In the context, the authors use remote sensing and citizen science data for bird species distribution modeling. However, the specific feature engineering techniques are not mentioned.

Lastly, it is worth noting that the provided context focuses on the architecture and training of a deep learning model for species distribution modeling. The preprocessing steps might have been performed before presenting the model's details.

In summary, normalization, scaling, and cleaning are common preprocessing steps before training a deep learning model. In the provided context, batch normalization is used for normalization, but no scaling or explicit data cleaning techniques are mentioned.
