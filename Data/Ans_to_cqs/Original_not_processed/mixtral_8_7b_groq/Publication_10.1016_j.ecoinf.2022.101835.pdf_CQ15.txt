Answer:::

The optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include Adam and RMSprop.

In the study mentioned in the context, the researchers used a deep learning algorithm to predict the flowering and full blossom dates of plants. They optimized the structure and hyperparameters of the deep learning model using Optuna, where they considered several candidates for the optimizer, including Adam and RMSprop.

Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is a popular optimization algorithm for training deep learning models. It is an extension of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm that adaptively adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the estimated first and second moments of the gradient. Adam has been shown to converge faster and achieve better performance than SGD in many deep learning applications.

RMSprop, which stands for Root Mean Square Propagation, is another optimization algorithm for training deep learning models. It is similar to Adam but uses a different approach to adaptively adjust the learning rate. RMSprop divides the learning rate by an exponentially decaying average of the squared gradients, which helps to stabilize the learning process and avoid oscillations.

In the study, the researchers found that the optimized deep learning models achieved better performance than the random forest and gradient boosting models in predicting the flowering and full blossom dates of plants. However, they did not provide details on which optimizer performed better between Adam and RMSprop.

Therefore, we can conclude that the optimization techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include Adam and RMSprop, but the study did not provide information on which one performed better in the specific application.
