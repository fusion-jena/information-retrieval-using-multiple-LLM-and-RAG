Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline mentioned is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). This is evident from the context that discusses the use of deep learning for extracting ecological information from camera trap images, including species labels, counts, and behaviors. It is noted that DCNNs have been extensively utilized for image processing and have shown success in extracting information from camera trap images. However, the specific architecture or configuration of the DCNN is not provided in the context.
