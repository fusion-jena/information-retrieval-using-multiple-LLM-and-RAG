Answer:::

 The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline are primarily focused on time, frequency, and spectrogram domains. These techniques include adding Gaussian noise, pink noise, primary and secondary background noise soundscapes, primary and secondary background noise (from the Bird Audio Detection dataset), background noise (such as wind, thunder, or aircrafts), mixed up random bird species, horizontal and vertical rolls, pitch shift, time mask, frequency mask, gain, loudness normalization, horizontal and vertical flips, time stretch, and tanh-based distortion. However, the context does not explicitly mention techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling which are commonly used data augmentation methods in computer vision tasks. It is possible that these techniques were not used in this particular deep learning pipeline.

 The techniques were applied to different domains, such as time domain, frequency domain, and spectrogram. For instance, horizontal and vertical flips were applied in the time domain, while pitch shift, time mask, and frequency mask were applied in the frequency and spectrogram domains. The addition of noise, such as Gaussian and pink noise, was applied in the time domain, while gain and loudness normalization were applied in the frequency domain.

 The impact of these data augmentation techniques on model performance was visualized in Figure 3, and a comprehensive overview of all results was compiled in Table 4, displaying F1-scores for various single and combined augmentation strategies. The results showed that the application of these techniques improved the performance of the models, with the best combined augmentations discussed in the results section.
