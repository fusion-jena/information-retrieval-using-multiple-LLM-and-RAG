Answer:::

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error (SMAPE), and Normalized Mean Prediction Interval Width (NMPIW).

MAE is a common metric for regression problems, which measures the average magnitude of the errors in the predictions made by the model. It is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values.

SMAPE is another metric used for evaluating the accuracy of a model's predictions. It is a percentage error that takes into account the difference between the predicted and actual values, relative to the actual value. SMAPE values below 20% are considered desirable, indicating accurate and balanced predictions.

NMPIW is a metric that measures the quality of prediction intervals in relation to the variability of the observed data. It is calculated as the average width of the prediction intervals, normalized by the range of the observed data. NMPIW values close to 0 reflect narrow prediction intervals compared with the observed data range, indicating a good model.

In addition to these metrics, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) is also considered valid for the analysis of the model's performance. However, the provided context does not mention other metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall, which are commonly used for evaluating classification models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are MAE, SMAPE, and NMPIW.
