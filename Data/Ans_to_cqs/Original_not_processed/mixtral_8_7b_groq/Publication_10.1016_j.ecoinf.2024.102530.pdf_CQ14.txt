Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the InVEST pollination model are optimized. The text does not mention any specific techniques such as grid search, random search, or others.

However, it does provide some information about the choices made for certain parameters of the model. For instance, the flight distance of honey bees was set to 5 km, based on previous studies. Similarly, the biophysical attribute table was created using land cover data, and two evaluations were conducted for each land cover type.

Furthermore, the study mentions that reducing the pixel size in urban and agricultural areas can increase the accuracy of the pollination model. However, it does not specify whether this was considered as a hyperparameter tuning method or simply a choice of resolution for the input data.

Therefore, while some information about the parameter choices and data preprocessing is provided, the specific methods used for hyperparameter optimization are not mentioned in the given context.
