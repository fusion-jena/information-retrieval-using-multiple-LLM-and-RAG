Based on the provided context, there is no information about the deployment of a trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the use of machine learning, specifically hidden Markov models (HMMs), for inferring animal behavior from location and movement data. However, it does not discuss the process of deploying a trained model.

The context explains how HMMs can be used to analyze animal movement paths and infer behavioral states. It describes the use of Weibull or gamma distributions to model step lengths in HMMs. The authors also mention the importance of accurate location estimation for the behavioral segmentation of animal movement paths.

The context includes references to various machine learning and statistical methods, such as supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, approximate Bayesian computation, and Bayesian analysis. However, it does not provide details on how a deep learning model would be trained or deployed.

Therefore, we cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
