Answer:

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on presenting the performance of various models for plant disease classification and does not mention any code repositories like GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.

The models mentioned in the context include DEX, ViT-30, ViT-20, LAMP-LFD, Decision Tree, DHLC-DETR, Hicham et al., Vivek et al., Farian et al., and Vaibhav et al. Additionally, a proposed model called BEiT is presented, which outperforms other models in leaf disease classification tasks. However, there is no information about where the code for these models or the deep learning pipeline is available.

For reproducibility, the definitions of various parameters and functions are provided, but the actual code implementation is not given. The context also includes tables comparing the performance of the models, but the code used to generate these results is not provided.

Therefore, I cannot provide the code repository for the deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
