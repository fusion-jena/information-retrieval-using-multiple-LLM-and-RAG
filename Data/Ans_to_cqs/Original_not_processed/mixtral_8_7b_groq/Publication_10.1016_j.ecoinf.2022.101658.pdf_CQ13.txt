Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The focus of the text is on the use of deep learning for semantic segmentation of boreal forest ground cover vegetation, and the challenges posed by class imbalance. It describes the methodological steps taken and the datasets used, but it does not provide details about the deep learning model's hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
