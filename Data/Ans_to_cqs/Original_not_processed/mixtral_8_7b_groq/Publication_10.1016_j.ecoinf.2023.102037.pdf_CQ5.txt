The context provided does not give information about the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipelines for training and testing the models, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention two datasets that were used specifically for pest detection and classification.

The first dataset is "Pest24" which was used by Wang et al. (2020a, 2020b, 2020c) in their study on crop pests image classification algorithm based on deep convolutional neural network. The dataset consisted of 25,378 annotated images coming from 24 pest species that were all collected by an automatic imaging trap. They obtained a mean Average Precision (mAP) score of 63.54% using YOLOv3 while detecting and classifying pest species from the images in their "Pest24" dataset.

The second dataset is COCO (Common Objects in Context) which was used by Hong et al. (2021) in their study on AI-based pest counting method for monitoring the black pine bast scale. They developed an AI-based pest counting method for monitoring the black pine bast scale (M. thungergianae) which reached a detection and classification accuracy in the popular object detection benchmarking dataset, known as COCO, on which it was originally trained.

It's important to note that these datasets are specific to the studies mentioned and not general deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
