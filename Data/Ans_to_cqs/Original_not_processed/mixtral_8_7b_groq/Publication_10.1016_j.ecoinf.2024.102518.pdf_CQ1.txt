The provided context does not give specific details about the deep learning pipeline used in this study. However, it does mention the use of occurrence data and environmental variables for species distribution modeling.

The occurrence data could be collected through various methods such as surveys, field observations, or even from existing databases and public datasets. For instance, the study by Beery et al. (2021) mentions the use of occurrence data in the context of species distribution modeling. Still, it does not explicitly specify how this data was collected.

On the other hand, environmental variables are often obtained from sensors, remote sensing, or GIS databases. In the study, several environmental variables are used, such as temperature, precipitation, and land cover types. These variables could be sourced from sensors or satellites, which measure and record these environmental factors over time and space.

Additionally, the study by Agua et al. (2017) discusses the use of railway ecology data, which could include occurrence data and environmental variables collected along railway corridors. This could involve a combination of sensors, observations, and existing databases.

It is also worth noting that the study by Boria et al. (2014) discusses the use of spatial filtering techniques to reduce sampling bias in ecological niche models. This implies that the raw data used in their study might have been collected using methods susceptible to bias, such as opportunistic sampling or non-random survey methods. Thus, spatial filtering techniques were applied to improve the performance of the ecological niche models.

In summary, the raw data used in the deep learning pipeline for species distribution modeling could be collected through various methods, such as surveys, sensors, remote sensing, and public datasets. However, the specific methods used in the provided context are not explicitly mentioned.
