Answer:::

The performance of the deep learning model for classifying Brazilian Savanna physiognomies is evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. 

The overall accuracy (OA) of the model is 92.8%, indicating that the model correctly classifies 92.8% of the pixels in the image. 

Precision is calculated for each class (Grassland, Savanna, and Forest) as the number of true positives (correctly classified pixels) divided by the total number of predicted positives (predicted and true positives). The precision for Grassland is 0.95, for Savanna is 0.91, and for Forest is 0.95.

Recall is calculated for each class as the number of true positives divided by the total number of actual positives (true positives and false negatives). The recall for Grassland is 0.89, for Savanna is 0.95, and for Forest is 0.96.

The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of both. The F1-score for Grassland is 0.92, for Savanna is 0.93, and for Forest is 0.95.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model at the first level of classification, using the RGB+EVI2 dataset. The model is further evaluated using a patch-wise analysis of the WorldView-2 image, reference data, and resulting thematic maps.

In addition, the model's performance is evaluated in terms of misclassified areas between Grassland and Savanna (GxS), between Savanna and Forest (SxF), and between Grassland and Forest (GxF).

Therefore, the model's performance is evaluated using a comprehensive set of metrics, providing a thorough understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses.
