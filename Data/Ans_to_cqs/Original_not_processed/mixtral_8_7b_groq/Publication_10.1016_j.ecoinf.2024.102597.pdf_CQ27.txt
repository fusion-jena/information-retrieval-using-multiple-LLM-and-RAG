Based on the provided context, there is no information about the deployment of a trained deep learning model. The text mainly focuses on the use of machine learning models, specifically ensemble learning models, to estimate Chla concentration and turbidity in Nansi Lake.

However, it does mention that deep learning algorithms were considered but not used due to the limited number of samples. Therefore, it can be inferred that the process of deploying a trained deep learning model was not followed in this particular study.

Answer:::
The provided context does not contain information on the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. The focus of the study was on the development and comparison of ensemble learning models for estimating water quality parameters.
