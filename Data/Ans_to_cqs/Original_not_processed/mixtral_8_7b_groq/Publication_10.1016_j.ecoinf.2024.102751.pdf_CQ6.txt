Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model for estimating soil moisture. However, it is generally recommended to perform certain preprocessing steps before training a deep learning model. These steps include:

1. Data cleaning: This involves removing any irrelevant, missing, or inconsistent data from the dataset. In the context of estimating soil moisture, this might involve removing any outlier values or missing data points from the remote sensing data or topographic indices.
2. Data normalization or scaling: This involves transforming the data to a common scale, typically between 0 and 1, to ensure that all the features have equal importance and to prevent any feature from dominating the learning process. This is especially important in deep learning models, where the model can be sensitive to the scale of the input features.
3. Feature engineering: This involves creating new features from the existing data that might help improve the model's performance. For example, in the context of estimating soil moisture, new features might be created by combining remote sensing data with topographic indices or other relevant data.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that these preprocessing steps would be involved before training a deep learning model for estimating soil moisture using remote sensing data and topographic indices. However, the specific preprocessing steps would depend on the characteristics of the data and the specific deep learning model being used.
