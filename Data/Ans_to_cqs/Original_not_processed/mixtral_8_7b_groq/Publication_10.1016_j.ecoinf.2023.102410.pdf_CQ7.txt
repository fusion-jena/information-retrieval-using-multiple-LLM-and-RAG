Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, I can suggest a possible approach based on common practices in data analysis and machine learning.

Answer:::

In the context of data analysis and machine learning, it is essential to split the dataset into training, validation, and testing subsets to evaluate the model's performance and prevent overfitting. However, the provided context does not mention any specific criteria for splitting the data in this particular case.

A common approach for splitting the data is to use 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. This allocation ensures a sufficient sample size for each subset while maintaining a balance between them.

In the context of tracking animal vocalizations, the data could be split based on the song variant or pattern. For instance, you could allocate 70% of the data from each song variant to the training set, 15% to the validation set, and 15% to the testing set. This method ensures that the model is trained and tested on a diverse range of song patterns, improving its ability to generalize and accurately classify new, unseen data.

Additionally, if there is a temporal aspect to the data, such as recordings taken at different times or seasons, you could consider splitting the data based on time to ensure that the model is exposed to various environmental conditions during training.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria for splitting the data, a common approach is to allocate 70% for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. In the context of tracking animal vocalizations, it may be beneficial to split the data based on song variant or pattern and, if applicable, temporal factors.
