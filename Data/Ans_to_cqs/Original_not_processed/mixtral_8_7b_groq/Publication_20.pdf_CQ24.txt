Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe other strategies that are used to ensure the reliability and validity of the model's performance.

To prevent overfitting, the network training was stopped after 70 epochs, and a learning rate decay with a Gamma of 0.95 was used. Additionally, a dropout of 50% was employed, which randomly drops out a number of output features of the layer during training. This helps to prevent over-reliance on specific neurons and encourages the model to learn more robust features.

Furthermore, the training dataset was built using four different strategies to assess the influence of the dataset building on classification results. The first training dataset, T1, contained raw fish thumbnails and their respective mirror images. This strategy doubled the number of thumbnails per fish individual by flipping each thumbnail with respect to the vertical axis, which homogenized the proportion of left-oriented and right-oriented individuals in the database. This approach could improve the average identification rate since fish individuals are seen in all positions.

In the post-processing stage, two decision rules were applied to the raw outputs. The first decision rule (r1) kept the most likely fish class if "environment" was the most likely class. The second decision rule (r2) considered "part of species X" equivalent to "species X". These rules helped to reduce false positives and improve the overall accuracy of the model.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does describe other strategies such as early stopping, learning rate decay, dropout, and decision rules that were used to ensure the reliability and validity of the model's performance.
