Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model for NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) reconstruction. However, some of the articles do mention techniques that could be used as preprocessing steps in similar tasks.

In the context of NDVI reconstruction, preprocessing steps might include:

1. **Data Cleaning**: This could involve removing or correcting erroneous NDVI values. For instance, Zhou et al. (2015) use the Harmonic Analysis of Time Series (HANTS) method to remove noise from MODIS NDVI time series data.

2. **Time-Series Reconstruction**: This is a crucial step in NDVI reconstruction, as it involves filling gaps caused by clouds or other obstructions. Techniques like HANTS (Zhou et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2021) or the Savitzky-Golay filter (Chen et al., 2004) can be used for this purpose.

3. **Normalization or Scaling**: While not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, normalization or scaling is a common preprocessing step in deep learning. It can help to ensure that all features have a similar range and can contribute equally to the model's learning process.

In the context of deep learning model training, the paper by Wang et al. (2023) mentions using a deep learning-enhanced fusion method for improved NDVI reconstruction. However, the specific preprocessing steps are not detailed.

So, while we can infer some potential preprocessing steps from the provided context, the specific preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model for NDVI reconstruction in the mentioned studies are not explicitly stated.

Answer:::
The specific preprocessing steps taken before training a deep learning model for NDVI reconstruction are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, potential steps could include data cleaning, time-series reconstruction, and normalization or scaling.
