Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The text focuses on the use of penalized regression techniques, specifically lasso regression, for predicting intensity maps. It explains how the lasso penalty is tuned using the Bayesian information criteria (BIC) and how new R functions were created to implement these extensions. The simulations were conducted on R4.0.1, and 1000 simulations were performed using a high-performance computing cluster.

However, the process of determining when training is complete is typically an essential part of machine learning models, including those using penalized regression techniques. This process often involves monitoring the performance on a validation set during training and stopping the training when the performance stops improving or starts degrading, indicating that the model is overfitting the training data.

In the context of lasso regression, this process could involve monitoring the performance of the model on a validation set as the lasso penalty is varied. The optimal penalty value could be chosen based on the performance on the validation set, such as by selecting the penalty value that results in the lowest validation loss.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete, it is reasonable to assume that some form of validation-based criteria was used during the training process.
