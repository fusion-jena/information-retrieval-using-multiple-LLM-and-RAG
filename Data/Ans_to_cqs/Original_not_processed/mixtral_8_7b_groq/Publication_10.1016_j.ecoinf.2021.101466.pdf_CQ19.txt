Answer:::
The deep learning model in the given context is built using Keras 2.4.3, which is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. However, based on the provided information, it is not explicitly mentioned if the Theano or CNTK backends were used. Given that Keras is most commonly used with TensorFlow, it is reasonable to assume that TensorFlow was the chosen backend. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the specific backend is not explicitly stated in the context.
