Answer:::

The text does not provide a specific example of stratiified splitting in the context of addressing data bias in deep learning for bioacoustic classification. However, it does mention the use of diverse data collection and techniques such as oversampling and undersampling to address class imbalance.

In the context of bioacoustic classification, diverse data collection could involve collecting data from a variety of sources, locations, and conditions to ensure that the dataset is representative of the target population. This can help to reduce bias in the data by ensuring that it is not skewed towards certain characteristics or situations.

Class imbalance is a common issue in bioacoustic datasets, where some classes may have many more examples than others. This can lead to bias in the training process, where the model becomes better at classifying the majority class and performs poorly on the minority class. To address this issue, techniques such as oversampling and undersampling can be used.

Oversampling involves creating more examples of the minority class, either by duplicating existing examples or by generating synthetic examples using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). This can help to balance the class distribution and give the model more opportunities to learn the features of the minority class.

Undersampling involves reducing the number of examples in the majority class to balance the class distribution. This can be done randomly or by using techniques such as Tomek links, which identify and remove examples that are close to the boundary between the classes.

In addition to these techniques, the use of deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can also help to reduce bias in bioacoustic classification. These models are capable of learning complex features and patterns in the data, which can help to improve the accuracy and robustness of the classification.

Overall, addressing data bias in the deep learning pipeline for bioacoustic classification involves a combination of diverse data collection, techniques to address class imbalance such as oversampling and undersampling, and the use of advanced deep learning models.
