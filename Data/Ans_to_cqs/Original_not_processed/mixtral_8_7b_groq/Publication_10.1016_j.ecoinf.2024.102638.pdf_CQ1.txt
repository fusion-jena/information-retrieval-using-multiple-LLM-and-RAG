Answer:

The context provided does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention various types of data that are used in the pipeline, which can give us some insight into the possible data collection methods.

The data used in the pipeline includes soil moisture, pressure, precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, global radiation, reflected radiation, atmospheric radiation, emitted radiation, sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, and carbon dioxide flux. These variables are measured at semi-hourly intervals.

Given this information, it is likely that the raw data is collected using sensors that measure these variables. For example, soil moisture could be measured using a soil moisture probe, while air temperature and relative humidity could be measured using a thermometer and hygrometer, respectively. Radiation variables could be measured using a radiation station, while heat and carbon dioxide fluxes could be measured using an eddy covariance station.

It is also possible that some of the data is obtained from public datasets. For example, precipitation data could potentially be obtained from a meteorological agency. However, the context does not provide enough information to confirm this.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on the methods used for collecting raw data, it is likely that sensors are used to measure the various variables included in the pipeline. It is also possible that some data is obtained from public datasets.
