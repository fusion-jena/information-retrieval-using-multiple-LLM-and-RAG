The provided context does not give information about the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe the data sources and data types used in a study related to carbon emissions in Xi'an, China. The data types include energy consumption statistics, which are categorized into nine types, including raw coal, crude oil, coke, gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel, fuel oil, natural gas, and electricity. These energy consumption statistics are converted to standard coal consumption based on their calorific value using standard coal conversion factors. Additionally, the study uses carbon emission coefficients for each type of energy source and administrative boundary data for Xi'an.

The data sources for this study include the National Earth System Science Data Centre, the China Statistical Yearbook, the Xi'an Statistical Yearbook, and the National Basic Geographic Information System. The data for nighttime lighting is extended NPP-VIIRS-like NTL Data for 2000-2021, which is available for free download at the National Earth System Science Data Centre. Provincial statistical energy data for 2000-2021 are obtained from the China Statistical Yearbook, municipal statistical data are obtained from the Xi'an Statistical Yearbook, and carbon emission factors for various energy sources are obtained from the "2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventory". Administrative boundary data for Xi'an (district, county, and street administrative boundaries) were provided by the National Basic Geographic Information System.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly answer the query about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline, it does give insight into the data sources and data types used in a specific study.
