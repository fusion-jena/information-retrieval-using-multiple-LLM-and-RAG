Answer:::

The provided context discusses several studies related to land-use types, soil properties, and ecosystem services, but it does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does give some insights into the types of data used in these studies.

In the study by Huang et al. (2019), high-resolution remotely sensed imagery is used to monitor ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen. This suggests that they used satellite or aerial imagery as one of their data sources. In the study by Jiang et al. (2019), land degradation and its drivers in the Amudarya River delta are assessed using data from the Ecol. Indic. journal. The specific data collection method is not mentioned, but it is likely that they used a combination of field measurements and remote sensing data.

Kavian et al. (2014) studied the effects of deforestation on soil properties, runoff, and erosion in northern Iran. They likely used a combination of field measurements and laboratory analyses to collect their data. Kopittke et al. (2019) focused on soil and the intensification of agriculture for global food security, but the data collection method is not specified.

The context also provides information about some of the data sources used in these studies. For example, it mentions the High-resolution World Soil Database (HWSD) and the Basic Soil Property Dataset of High-resolution China Soil Information Grids. These are likely public datasets that were used in the studies.

In addition, the context mentions that future research on soil degradation should process data from the HWSD and the Basic Soil Property Dataset of High-resolution China Soil Information Grids jointly to improve temporal and spatial accuracy. This suggests that these datasets are important sources of information for soil degradation research.

Based on this information, we can infer that the studies likely used a combination of field measurements, remote sensing data, and public datasets for collecting raw data. However, the specific methods used for data collection are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
