Answer:::
The training of the model is determined to be complete when the validation EarthNetScore (ENS) repeatedly fails to improve compared to the score evaluated from previous epochs. In other words, when the model's performance on the validation set stops getting better, the training is considered complete. This is often referred to as a validation loss plateau, where the loss (or score) remains relatively constant across multiple epochs.

In the specific case described in the context, the model training on the NVIDIA GTX 1080 GPU took approximately 460 hours. The optimization was stopped once the validation ENS repeatedly failed to improve. The model at the epoch with the highest attained validation score was selected as the final model.

It's worth noting that the SGED-ConvLSTM model tended to improve more rapidly on the validation score with an increasing number of training epochs, but started at a lower initial score. However, it reached its validation score plateau considerably sooner (after 44 epochs) than the SGConvLSTM model. On the other hand, the SGConvLSTM model continued to improve on its validation score and reached its validation score plateau after 92 epochs at a higher final ENS than the SGEDConvLSTM model. This suggests that different models may have different training dynamics and may require different stopping criteria for optimal performance.

In summary, the training of a model is determined to be complete when the validation score stops improving or reaches a plateau, indicating that the model's performance on unseen data has stabilized. The specific number of epochs required to reach this plateau may vary depending on the model and the dataset.
