The text provided does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention several roles and responsibilities related to data handling in a research context. These include resources, project administration, data curation, investigation, and validation.

Data curation generally refers to the process of collecting, cleaning, maintaining, and making data available for further use. This can involve various methods of data collection, such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets. Investigation and research often require the collection of new data, which could be done through various means depending on the specific research question and context. Validation, on the other hand, involves checking and confirming the quality and accuracy of the data.

Based on the roles and responsibilities mentioned, it is likely that the research project involves the collection and handling of data in some way. However, the text does not provide enough information to determine the specific methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

In the context of deep learning, data collection methods can vary widely depending on the specific application. For example, in computer vision applications, data might be collected through image or video cameras, while in natural language processing, data might be collected through text corpora or speech recordings. Public datasets are often used in deep learning research, as they provide large amounts of labeled data that can be used for training and testing models.

In summary, while the text provided does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention roles and responsibilities related to data handling. Based on these, it is likely that the research project involves the collection and handling of data in some way. The specific methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning applications can vary widely, and may include surveys, sensors, or public datasets.
