Answer:::

In the context provided, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include Gaussian Noise, Speckle Noise, converting the image to a tensor, and normalization.

Firstly, Gaussian Noise and Speckle Noise are added to the dataset. Gaussian Noise introduces a random variation to the image data, which can help the model generalize better to unseen data. Speckle Noise, on the other hand, is a type of multiplicative noise that can simulate various real-world scenarios such as ultrasound or radar imaging.

Next, the images are converted to tensors, which are a multi-dimensional array data structure used in deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. This step is necessary as it allows the images to be processed and manipulated using mathematical operations that are optimized for GPU processing.

Finally, the images are normalized. Normalization is a preprocessing step that scales the pixel values of the image to a range between 0 and 1. This is done by subtracting the mean pixel value and dividing by the standard deviation of the pixel values. In the provided context, the mean pixel value is [0.485, 0.456, 0.406] and the standard deviation is [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]. Normalization helps the model converge faster during training and can improve the accuracy of the model.

Therefore, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, as described in the provided context, include adding Gaussian and Speckle Noise, converting the image to a tensor, and normalizing the pixel values.
