Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention that the deep learning model used in the study is a Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE) and that it was trained using Landsat image data combined with phenological features of paddy rice. The authors suggest that the deep learning model (SAE) benefited more than the Support Vector Machine (SVM) from combining data in the two phenological stages using Ppf-CM, likely due to the deep network structure and strong self-learning ability of the SAE.

Additionally, the context states that a sensitivity analysis method was used to determine the optimal parameters for the SVM model, including the "gamma" parameter in the RBF kernel and the "cost" parameter. However, it does not mention any sensitivity analysis or hyperparameter tuning for the deep learning model.

Therefore, while the context provides some information about the training of the deep learning model, it does not give specific details about the hyperparameters used.
