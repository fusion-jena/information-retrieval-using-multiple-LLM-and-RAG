Answer:::

The context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. Hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in training machine learning models, including deep learning models, to ensure good performance. Common methods for hyperparameter optimization include grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. Grid search involves testing all possible combinations of hyperparameters within a specified range, while random search selects hyperparameters at random within a specified range. Bayesian optimization, on the other hand, uses Bayes' theorem to iteratively select hyperparameters that are likely to result in better performance.

In the context provided, the focus is on the use of deep learning models for remote sensing data classification. The authors describe the architecture of a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) commonly used for sequential data. The LSTM network consists of input, forget, and output gates, which control the flow of information into and out of the memory cell. The authors also mention some approaches for evaluating the interpretability of deep learning models, such as gradient-based sensitivity analysis, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), and class activation maps. However, there is no information on how the hyperparameters of the LSTM network are optimized.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
