Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the performance of different CNN architectures, including customized models and state-of-the-art models like EfficientNetB0 and DenseNet121, on a moths dataset. However, it does not mention where the dataset or the code for the deep learning pipeline is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
