Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific deep learning model used in the pipeline. The text discusses the process of data filtering and scaling for environmental data, but it does not mention any deep learning models.

Data filtering involves acquiring data from the EECE and applying masks to filter and preprocess the data. Data scaling is the final step, which includes gap filling and data matching. The approach follows a "pre-modelling scaling" protocol, and sequential processes are implemented within GEE for scaling up environmental time series.

However, the text does not mention any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this query without additional information.
