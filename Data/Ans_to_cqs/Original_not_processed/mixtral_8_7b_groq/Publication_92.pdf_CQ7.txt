Answer:::

The text provided does not give explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the dataset is composed of 13,000 fish thumbnails, and additional data has been added for the background, part of fish, and fish classes.

In general, for deep learning model training, it is common to split the dataset into three subsets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

The splitting criteria can vary depending on the specific problem and dataset size. A common approach is to use 60-20-20 or 70-15-15 splits for training, validation, and testing, respectively. Another approach is to use k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is divided into k subsets or "folds," and the model is trained and validated k times, each time using a different fold for validation and the remaining k-1 folds for training.

In the context of this coral reef fish detection and recognition problem, the authors might have used a similar approach for splitting their dataset. However, without explicit information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
