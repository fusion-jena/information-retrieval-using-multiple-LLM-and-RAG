The text provided does not give information about a deep learning model or the metrics used to evaluate its performance. Instead, it discusses the use of redescriptions as building blocks for identifying new ecoregions and the parameters and constraints set for this process. The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the redescriptions are accuracy, support, and Jaccard coefficient.

Accuracy is used to rank the redescriptions, with higher accuracy redescriptions given precedence. Support is used to filter out redescriptions that have more than 90% of their support in common with a higher-ranked redescription. The Jaccard coefficient is used to measure the accuracy of candidate queries in the second run, with a candidate query only being extended if the Jaccard coefficient increases by at least 0.1.
