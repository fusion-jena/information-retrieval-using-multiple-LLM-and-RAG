Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, the URL provided refers to an article that discusses improving cloud detection with machine learning, and the abstract is from an article focused on wetland use intensity in East Africa using Sentinel-2 data.

In the context of remote sensing and image processing, common data annotation techniques for deep learning include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This technique involves drawing a rectangle around the object of interest in an image. It is a simple and efficient way to label objects, especially when dealing with large datasets.
2. Instance segmentation: This method involves creating a mask for each object instance in an image, differentiating it from other objects and the background. It is a more time-consuming and complex process than bounding box annotation but provides more precise information about the object's shape and location.
3. Semantic segmentation: This technique involves classifying each pixel in an image into a specific class or category. It is useful for understanding the composition and context of a scene but does not differentiate between individual object instances.

For the Sentinel-2 data used in the wetland study, data annotation techniques might include semantic segmentation for land cover classification or instance segmentation for identifying specific wetland areas. However, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
