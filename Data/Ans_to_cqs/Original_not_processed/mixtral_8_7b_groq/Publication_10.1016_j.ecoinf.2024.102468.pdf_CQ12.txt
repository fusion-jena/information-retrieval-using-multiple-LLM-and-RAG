Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of any specific type of deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or Transformer being used in the pipeline. The described methodology mainly focuses on the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for the detection of North Atlantic right whale up-calls. 

The pipeline involves training two HMMs (HMM1 and HMM2) independently and then combining them into an ergodic-type HMM with 8 states and 4 mixture weights. One HMM represents the waveform of blue whale vocalizations, while the other represents the noise signal. The feature vectors extracted from the test datasets are updated using the trained Gaussian parameters to produce refined feature vectors. These refined feature vectors, along with T and Ï€, are used by the V-alg to classify the test dataset as either blue whale vocalizations or noise.

However, it is important to note that the context does mention the use of a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring, Birdnet, in a separate study. This solution uses deep learning techniques, but it is not directly related to the blue whale vocalization detection pipeline described in the context.

Therefore, based on the given context, it can be concluded that the pipeline primarily uses HMMs, and there is no explicit mention of any specific deep learning models like CNN, RNN, or Transformer being employed in the process.
