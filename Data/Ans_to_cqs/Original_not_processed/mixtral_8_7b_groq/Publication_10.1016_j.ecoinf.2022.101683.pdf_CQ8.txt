Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study by M.S. Freeman et al. in the Ecological Informatics journal article from 2022. The context includes details about the methodology and data sources used in the study, but it does not mention where the code for the deep learning pipeline can be found.

It is possible that the code repository is not publicly available, or it may be hosted on a platform other than GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific location for the code repository.

If you are interested in accessing the code for the deep learning pipeline, I would recommend reaching out to the authors of the study directly to inquire about its availability. They may be able to provide more information or direct you to the appropriate location.
