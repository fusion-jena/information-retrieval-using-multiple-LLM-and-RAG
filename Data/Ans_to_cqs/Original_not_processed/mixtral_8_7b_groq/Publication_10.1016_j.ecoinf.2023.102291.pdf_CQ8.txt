Unfortunately, the provided context does not specify where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. The context mentions that the algorithm scripts are available in Supporting Information B, but it does not mention a code repository on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
