The text provided does not explicitly mention the methods used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention some steps that could indirectly contribute to the model's generalizability.

Firstly, the authors normalized all input channels (red, green, blue, and depth) by subtracting the respective mean and dividing by the respective standard deviation over the whole dataset. This step is a common technique to improve the model's performance and generalizability by reducing the effect of varying scales and biases in the input data.

Secondly, the authors introduced a feature fusion module to combine the extracted features from both backbones using one 3 × 3 convolution per FPN scale and reduce the number of channels from 2 × 256 to 256. This step allows them to use weights pre-trained on the Microsoft COCO dataset for the region proposal network (RPN) classifier and mask head. Using pre-trained weights can help improve the model's generalizability by providing a good initial point for optimization and reducing overfitting.

Thirdly, the authors restricted their evaluation of D-Mask R-CNN to instances of deers as it is the most common species in their RGB-D dataset. While this step may not directly contribute to the model's generalizability, it allows them to focus on a specific task and evaluate the model's performance more accurately.

Lastly, the authors used the average precision (AP), AP50, and AP75 metrics as defined by the Microsoft COCO dataset to quantify the results of D-Mask R-CNN. These metrics are widely used in object detection and segmentation tasks and can provide a good measure of the model's performance and generalizability.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the methods used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, it does mention some steps that could indirectly contribute to the model's generalizability, such as data normalization, feature fusion, using pre-trained weights, and evaluation metrics. However, it is possible that the authors used other methods, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, which are not mentioned in the text.
