Answer:::

The provided context discusses various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures such as VGG16, ResNet-50, Xception, DenseNet121, and a proposed model, but it does not explicitly mention any optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. However, it can be inferred that some optimization techniques might have been used during the training of these models.

For instance, the VGG16 model was trained on the ImageNet dataset, which consists of 1,000,000 images. Training such a large dataset would require an optimization technique to converge to the optimal solution within a reasonable time. Similarly, the training of ResNet-50, Xception, DenseNet121, and the proposed model was done on the Google Colab repository with a CPU running at 2.30GHz. Training these models on such a setup would require an optimization technique to avoid long training times.

Additionally, the context mentions that the training runtime for VGG16, Xception, and ResNet50 is 22.27, 21.26, and 30.8 minutes, respectively. These training times suggest that some optimization techniques might have been used to reduce the training time.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention any optimization techniques, it can be inferred that some optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, or others might have been used during the training of these CNN models.
