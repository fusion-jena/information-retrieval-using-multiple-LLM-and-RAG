Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, as described in the provided context, include the learning rate, the number of training epochs, and the batch size. The learning rate is set to 0.0001, which is a common choice for optimizing neural networks to avoid overshooting the optimal solution. There are 300 training epochs, which refers to the number of times the learning algorithm works through the entire training dataset. A batch size of 24 indicates that the model processes 24 data instances at a time before updating the model's weights. Additionally, an attention rate of 0.05 is implemented, but it is not clear from the context if this is a hyperparameter or a parameter of the attention mechanism. The dataset is divided chronologically into a training set (70%), a validation set (10%), and a test set (20%), which helps enhance the generalizability of the model. The model is implemented and tested on a Windows 11 operating system using Python 3.8, with specific hardware, including a laptop with a 12th-Gen Intel Core i7-12700H GPU at 2.30 GHz and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 GPU. The early stopping strategy is employed to prevent overfitting issues. However, the context does not provide information on the optimizer used in the model.
