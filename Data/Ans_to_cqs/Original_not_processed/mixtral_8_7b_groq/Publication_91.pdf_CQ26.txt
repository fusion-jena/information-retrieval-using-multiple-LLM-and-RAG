The provided context discusses the creation and use of a large dataset for training a deep learning model to identify pollen species based on multispectral images. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. Therefore, based on the given information, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.

However, I can discuss some common techniques used to address data bias in deep learning preprocessing, which may provide context and background for the query:

1. Stratified splitting: When splitting a dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, it is important to maintain the same distribution of classes in each set. Stratified splitting ensures that each set has a representative sample of all classes in the original dataset.
2. Oversampling: When a dataset is imbalanced, with some classes having significantly more instances than others, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances in the minority classes. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority classes.
3. Undersampling: Alternatively, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of instances in the majority classes, balancing the dataset. However, this technique may result in loss of information and should be used with caution.
4. Diverse data collection: To avoid bias in the first place, it is important to collect a diverse dataset that represents all relevant classes and variations. This may involve collecting data from multiple sources or using techniques such as active learning to identify and acquire underrepresented instances.

While the provided context does not mention these techniques specifically, it does describe some preprocessing steps that can help reduce bias:

1. Centre cropping: By cropping all images to an equally sized rectangle, the model is less likely to be biased by differences in image size or aspect ratio.
2. Data augmentation: By augmenting the training set with flipped, brightness-adjusted, saturation-adjusted, contrast-adjusted, and hue-adjusted images, the model is exposed to a wider variety of instances, reducing the risk of overfitting and bias.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, it does describe some preprocessing steps that can help reduce bias. Additionally, I have provided a brief overview of common techniques used to address data bias in deep learning preprocessing.
