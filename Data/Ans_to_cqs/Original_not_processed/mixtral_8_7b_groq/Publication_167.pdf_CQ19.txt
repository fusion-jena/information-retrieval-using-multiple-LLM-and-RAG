Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention which framework was used to build the deep learning model. The deep learning module mentioned in the study could have been implemented using any of the popular deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Caffe, or Theano. The choice of the framework would depend on the specific requirements of the study, such as computational efficiency, ease of use, and support for the required neural network architectures. It is possible that the authors used one of these popular deep learning frameworks or a custom-built solution to implement the deep learning module. Without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
