Based on the provided context, the raw data used in the studies are obtained through the use of bioclimatic datasets, which are derived from meteorological measurements and observations. These datasets include variables related to temperature and precipitation, such as:

* bio1, 'Annual Mean Temperature'
* bio8, 'Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter'
* bio9, 'Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter'
* bio13, 'Precipitation of Wettest Month'
* bio19, 'Precipitation of Coldest Quarter'

These variables are used to analyze the ecological niches and distributions of various species in the Mediterranean region.

Additionally, the context also mentions the use of 'Slope' as a variable, which is likely derived from digital elevation models (DEMs) or other geographical data sources.

It is not explicitly stated in the provided context how these datasets are collected or if they are obtained from public repositories or through partnerships with meteorological institutions. However, it is common practice in scientific research to use publicly available datasets or to collaborate with organizations that collect and maintain such data.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the raw data used in these studies are collected through a combination of meteorological measurements, geographical data, and possibly public datasets.
