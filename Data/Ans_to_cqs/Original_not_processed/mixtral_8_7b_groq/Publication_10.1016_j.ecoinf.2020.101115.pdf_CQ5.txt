Answer:

The provided context does not give specific information about the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for fish scale and otolith image analysis. However, it does mention that scale and otolith images are used for age and growth estimations and are stored in a collaborative online space in the Irish Fish Biochronology Archive (IFBA) database. The image file name for any image is the same as the unique archive sample id in the IFBA database.

Moreover, the context discusses the MI's metadata repository, known as the Data Catalogue, which supports the storage of datasets generated by systems, programs, and individual researchers within the Marine Institute. The Data Catalogue is operated through Drupal, an open-source, web-based content management system, which enables database specialization by permitting developers to build custom modules. The IFBA database is a self-contained module, specifically designed for scales and otoliths, but flexible enough to be adapted for any biological sample type.

Therefore, while the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline for fish scale and otolith image analysis are not mentioned, it can be inferred that the datasets are likely stored in the MI Data Catalogue and possibly the IFBA database, and are used for age and growth estimations of fish.
