Answer:::
The provided context discusses various strategies to enhance the performance of deep learning models, particularly in the context of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), by reducing memory access and model complexity. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models such as learning rate or optimizer.

Hyperparameters are crucial configuration variables in machine learning models that control the training process and can significantly impact model performance. Common hyperparameters in deep learning models include:

1. Learning rate: The step size at which the model updates its parameters during training. A learning rate that is too high may cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, while a learning rate that is too low may result in slow convergence.
2. Optimizer: The algorithm used to update the model's parameters during training. Common optimizers include stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop. These optimizers use different strategies to update the parameters, such as incorporating momentum or adaptive learning rates.
3. Regularization: Techniques used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Common regularization techniques include L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping.
4. Batch size: The number of samples used in each iteration of the training process. A larger batch size can result in more stable gradients and faster training, but may also require more memory.
5. Number of epochs: The number of times the training process is repeated over the entire dataset. A larger number of epochs can result in better convergence, but may also lead to overfitting.

The context does mention that the number of layers in a model, as well as the number of convolutions and data parameters, can impact model performance and memory access. However, these are not hyperparameters but rather architectural choices made during model design.

In summary, while the provided context discusses various strategies to improve deep learning model performance, it does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the models. Common hyperparameters include learning rate, optimizer, regularization, batch size, and number of epochs.
