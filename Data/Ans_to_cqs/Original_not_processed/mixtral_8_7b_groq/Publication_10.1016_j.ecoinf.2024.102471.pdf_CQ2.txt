Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline discussed in the provided context involves working with audio data specifically. The raw waveform of the bird vocalization audio is initially used as input data. This waveform is then processed by the feature encoder of the pre-trained Wav2vec model, which converts the raw waveform into a sequence of feature vectors every 20 milliseconds.

Additionally, Mel spectrograms and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) are also used to represent the bird sounds. These are visual representations of the audio signals, where the Mel spectrogram shows the power of the signal as a function of frequency and time, and MFCC is a representation of the short-term power spectrum of a sound.

Therefore, in this particular deep learning pipeline, the data formats used are audio waveforms, Mel spectrograms, and MFCCs. No mention is made of other data formats such as images, videos, or CSV files.
