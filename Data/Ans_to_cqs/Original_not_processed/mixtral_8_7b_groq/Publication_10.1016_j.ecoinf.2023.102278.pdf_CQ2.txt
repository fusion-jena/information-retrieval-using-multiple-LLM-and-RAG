Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in the given context uses image data format as the input to the models. The models are trained and validated on the TLm dataset, which consists of images. The images are preprocessed using a network called NCNN, and the transformed input is then passed through a CNN such as ResNet or EfficientNet. The output of the CNN is viewed as a root representation, which is then transformed into level outputs using fully connected (FC) layers and an activation function. The final predicted class for each level is determined based on the maximum output value from the network at that level.

There is no mention of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV being used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it can be concluded that the pipeline uses only image data format.
