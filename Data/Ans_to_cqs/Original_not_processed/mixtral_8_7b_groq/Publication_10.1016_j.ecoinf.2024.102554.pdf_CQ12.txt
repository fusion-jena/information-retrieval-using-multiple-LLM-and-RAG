Based on the provided context, the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline for satellite data interpretation and Chl-a concentration estimation is not explicitly mentioned. The text focuses on the significance of machine learning methodologies and sophisticated algorithms for atmospheric correction, primarily in the context of the Sentinel-3 satellite and the analysis of optically complex waters.

However, it is important to note that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for analyzing image data, such as satellite imagery. CNNs are particularly effective in extracting spatial features from images, making them a strong candidate for this application. Nonetheless, without explicit information in the context, it is impossible to definitively state the specific deep learning model used in the pipeline.

Additionally, other deep learning models like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers might be used for processing sequential data or time-series data related to the satellite imagery. Still, the context does not provide enough information to confirm the use of these models.

In conclusion, while CNNs are a strong candidate for satellite image analysis, the specific deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
