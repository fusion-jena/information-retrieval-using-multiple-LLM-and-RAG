After training the model, several postprocessing steps were taken, including the calculation of metrics, generation of a confusion matrix, and creation of saliency maps. However, the text only explicitly mentions the creation of a confusion matrix.

To evaluate the performance of their farm dam detection model, the researchers generated a confusion matrix (Figure S1 in the Supplementary Materials). A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It compares the predicted labels with the actual labels and provides information about the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. From the confusion matrix, other metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, can be calculated. However, the text does not provide these additional metrics.

The text does not explicitly mention the creation of saliency maps. Saliency maps are a way to visualize the parts of an input that are most important for a model's prediction. They can be useful for understanding how a model is making its decisions and for identifying potential biases or errors.

In addition to the postprocessing steps mentioned above, the researchers also took several steps to improve the model's performance and generalizability. These steps included data augmentation, transfer learning, and the use of an 80-20% split for training and validation datasets. Data augmentation involves creating modified versions of the training data to increase the size and diversity of the training set. Transfer learning involves using a pre-trained model as a starting point for training a new model. This can help improve the new model's performance by leveraging the knowledge and features learned by the pre-trained model. The 80-20% split for training and validation datasets involves setting aside a portion of the labeled data for validating the model during training. This can help prevent overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

In summary, after training the model, the researchers generated a confusion matrix to evaluate its performance. However, they did not explicitly mention the creation of saliency maps or the calculation of additional metrics. They did take several steps to improve the model's performance and generalizability, including data augmentation, transfer learning, and the use of an 80-20% split for training and validation datasets.
