Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the research on groundwater-climate interactions in the Great Artesian Basin (GAB). The research article does not mention any specific code repository platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket where the code for the deep learning pipeline is available.

It is common practice in research to make the code and data used in the study available to other researchers for verification and reproducibility purposes. However, the context does not provide information on whether the authors have made the code publicly available or not.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query regarding the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this research.
