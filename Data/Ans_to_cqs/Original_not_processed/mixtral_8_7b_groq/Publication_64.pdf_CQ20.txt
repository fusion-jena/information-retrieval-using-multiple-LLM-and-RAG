Answer:::
The deep learning model for plant classification is trained using a GTX 1080, which is a type of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). There is no mention of the use of Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) in the provided context.

The use of a GPU for training the model is an important choice, as GPUs are well-suited for the types of computations required by deep learning algorithms. Specifically, GPUs are designed to handle many simultaneous computations, which is useful for the matrix and vector operations that are common in deep learning. The use of a GPU can significantly speed up the training process compared to using a Central Processing Unit (CPU).

In this case, the model is trained for 100 epochs on the GTX 1080, which takes 6 days. The training process involves applying data augmentation techniques to the images, such as shearing, translation, and mirroring. These techniques help to increase the amount of training data available to the model and can improve its performance. However, they also increase the computational requirements of the training process.

It's worth noting that the specific type of GPU used (in this case, a GTX 1080) can have a significant impact on the training time and overall performance of the model. Different GPUs have different numbers of processing cores, memory capacities, and other characteristics that can affect their suitability for deep learning tasks. In general, more powerful GPUs with larger memory capacities will be better suited for training larger and more complex deep learning models.
