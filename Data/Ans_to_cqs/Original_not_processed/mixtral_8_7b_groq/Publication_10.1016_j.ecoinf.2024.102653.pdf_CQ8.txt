Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the toxicovigilance tool described in the article. The article, "Using honey bee flight activity data and a deep learning model as a toxicovigilance tool," by Ulises Olivares-Pinto, CÃ©dric Alaux, Yves Le Conte, Didier Crauser, and Alberto Prado, focuses on the methodology, data collection, and application of the deep learning model for toxicovigilance. However, it does not mention where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline can be found, whether on GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other platform. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information.
