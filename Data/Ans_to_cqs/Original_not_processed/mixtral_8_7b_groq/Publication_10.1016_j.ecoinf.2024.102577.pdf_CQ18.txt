Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit description of a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during the training process. However, it is mentioned that the models' performance was evaluated after the training phase.

The performance of the models during the 5 x 10-fold cross-validations was measured using mean accuracies and standard deviations for each method and species. This step seems to have served as a form of validation during the training phase, as it would have provided insights into the models' performance at different stages of the training process.

Additionally, after training a model for each species using the selected variables, the results of the validation of the trained models are shown in Table 5. This validation step is crucial for assessing the models' performance and could be seen as a form of monitoring the models' behavior after training.

It is also important to note that the authors considered periodic updates of the models with new catch data to improve their performance. This iterative approach implies a level of monitoring and evaluation of the models' performance over time.

In summary, while there is no explicit description of a strategy to monitor the models' performance during the training process, the context suggests that validation and evaluation steps were taken after training, and an iterative approach was proposed for updating the models with new data.
