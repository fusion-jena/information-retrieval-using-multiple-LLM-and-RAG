Answer:

The provided context discusses various applications of deep learning in the field of fisheries and aquatic research, but it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general practices in deep learning, we can infer some of the data annotation techniques that might be used in this context.

Data annotation is a crucial step in the deep learning pipeline, where human annotators manually label or segment the objects of interest in the input data. This annotated data is then used to train deep learning models. In the context of fisheries and aquatic research, the objects of interest could be fish, cetaceans, or underwater machinery.

Some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning include:

1. **Bounding box annotation**: In this technique, human annotators draw rectangular boxes around the objects of interest in the input data. These boxes provide the location and size of the objects, enabling the deep learning model to learn to detect these objects in the input data. For instance, in the study by Palmer (2022), the authors might have used bounding box annotation to label fish in the landings data.

2. **Instance segmentation**: In this technique, human annotators draw precise boundaries around each instance of the object of interest in the input data. This technique provides more detailed information about the objects, enabling the deep learning model to learn to segment the objects in the input data. For instance, in the study by Qin et al. (2022), the authors might have used instance segmentation to label fish in the underwater images.

3. **Semantic segmentation**: In this technique, human annotators draw boundaries around categories of objects in the input data. This technique provides less detailed information about the objects compared to instance segmentation, but it enables the deep learning model to learn to segment categories of objects in the input data. For instance, in the study by Li et al. (2022a), the authors might have used semantic segmentation to label fish in the video data.

4. **Keypoint annotation**: In this technique, human annotators label specific keypoints or landmarks on the objects of interest in the input data. This technique enables the deep learning model to learn to detect and localize specific parts of the objects in the input data. For instance, in the study by Patton et al. (2023), the authors might have used keypoint annotation to label cetaceans in the photo data.

Overall, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, we can infer that some of these techniques might have been used based on general practices in deep learning.
