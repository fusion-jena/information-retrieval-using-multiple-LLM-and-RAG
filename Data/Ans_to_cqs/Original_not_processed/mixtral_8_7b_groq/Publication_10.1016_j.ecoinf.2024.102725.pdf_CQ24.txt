The provided context does not contain direct information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does discuss various methods and techniques used for improving the accuracy of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) reconstruction and vegetation cover studies.

One of the strategies mentioned is the use of fusion methods enhanced by deep learning techniques (Wang et al., 2023). These methods could potentially include strategies to handle randomness, such as the use of a fixed random seed value during training to ensure reproducibility of results. However, the context does not explicitly mention this.

Another technique discussed is the reconstruction of NDVI time series using the Harmonic ANalysis of Time Series (HANTS) method (Zhou et al., 2015, 2021). This method involves the decomposition of time series into harmonic components, which could potentially involve strategies to handle randomness in the data.

The Savitzky-Golay filter is another method mentioned for reconstructing high-quality NDVI time-series data sets (Chen et al., 2004). This filter uses a moving window to perform local polynomial regression, which could be affected by randomness in the data. However, the context does not discuss how this method handles randomness.

In the context of wildfire event probability prediction using NDVI data, Charizanos and Demirhan (2023) use a Bayesian prediction approach. Bayesian methods inherently include a probabilistic approach to handling uncertainty and randomness in the data.

In the context of SAR to optical image synthesis for cloud removal using generative adversarial networks (Bermudez et al., 2018), randomness could be an issue during the training of the generative model. However, the context does not discuss how this randomness is handled.

Overall, while the context discusses various methods and techniques for improving the accuracy of NDVI reconstruction and vegetation cover studies, it does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
