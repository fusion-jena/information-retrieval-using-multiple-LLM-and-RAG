Answer: Based on the provided context, the deep learning model presented in the study is used for image segmentation. The model aims to accurately segment fish bodies in digital images by creating precise pixel-level mask contours around the fish body boundary. This is achieved through a process called transfer learning, where pre-trained COCO weights are used to automate the image segmentation of fishes that are currently unrepresented with high-fidelity in readily accessible, annotated datasets for training neural networks. The overarching goal of training a neural network is to iteratively minimize the error between model output and expected output by optimally adjusting model weights and reaching model convergence. This allows the trained neural network to generalize well to novel input data, even when there is no prior task experience supplied. The deep learning model's purpose is to facilitate the rapid execution of accurate, high-throughput image segmentation of digitized organisms, requiring no extensive programming expertise from the users.
