Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets, are not specified in the provided context. However, it is common practice in machine learning to split the data into these three subsets to evaluate the performance and generalization of the model.

Typically, the data is split into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model.

In the context of the BirdNET model, the authors created the "Agmon annotated dataset" to evaluate its performance. The dataset comprises over 10,900 annotated recordings of >75 species, and the annotations have been carried out by expert birders highly skilled in species identification through vocalizations. However, the specific criteria used to split the data for training, validating, and testing the BirdNET model are not mentioned.

It is important to note that the data splitting strategy can affect the performance and generalization of the deep learning model. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider the criteria used to split the data and ensure that the subsets are representative of the entire dataset. Common approaches for data splitting include random sampling, stratified sampling, and k-fold cross-validation.
