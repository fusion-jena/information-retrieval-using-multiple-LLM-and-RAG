Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific criteria used to determine when the training of the model is complete. However, in machine learning, it is common to use certain conditions to decide when to stop the training process. These conditions often include:

1. Validation loss plateau: The training process is stopped when the validation loss does not decrease for a certain number of epochs, indicating that the model has likely learned the underlying patterns in the training data and further training might lead to overfitting.

2. Early stopping: This technique involves stopping the training process before the validation loss starts to increase, based on a predefined number of epochs or a predetermined patience level.

3. Monitoring other metrics: In some cases, the training can be stopped based on other performance metrics, such as accuracy or F1-score, if they reach a satisfactory level or stop improving significantly.

In the given context, the authors have presented evaluation results using various metrics, such as accuracy, F1-score, and Matthew's Correlation Coefficient (MCC). However, they have not explicitly mentioned the criteria used to determine when the training is complete.
