Answer:::

In the context provided, several preprocessing steps are described that are taken before training deep learning models. 

First, the resolution of input data is set to 224x224 with Red Green Blue (RGB) format. This is a form of data scaling, where the input data is resized to a specific dimension to ensure consistency and compatibility with the model's requirements.

Second, the inputs are batch normalized before training. Batch normalization is a technique where the inputs in each batch are normalized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This helps to reduce internal covariate shift, which is the change in the distribution of internal nodes of the network due to the change in parameters during training. By doing so, the network can learn more robust features, and the training process can be more stable and faster.

Third, a batch size of 30 is applied during training, but images are tested one by one. This is a form of data sampling, where a subset of the data is used for training at each iteration. Using a batch size can help to reduce the computational cost of training, as well as provide a regularization effect that can improve the generalization of the model.

Fourth, an optimized rectified linear activation, Leaky ReLU, is introduced into the models after the convolution or concatenate layer. This is a form of data transformation, where the activation function is used to introduce non-linearity into the model. The Leaky ReLU activation function is a variant of the ReLU function that allows a small, non-zero gradient for negative input values, which can help to mitigate the problem of dying ReLU.

Overall, these preprocessing steps are designed to ensure the accuracy of the experimental results and obtain the best classification. They help to prepare the data for training, reduce internal covariate shift, provide a regularization effect, and introduce non-linearity into the model.
