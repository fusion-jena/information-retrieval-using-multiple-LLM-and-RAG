Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. Regularization techniques such as dropout, L1/L2 regularization, early stopping, and data augmentation are commonly used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. However, the text only mentions the use of a deep learning model with a NASnet architecture and a Faster-rcnn backbone, implemented in Tensorflow2, and the training parameters. It does not specify any regularization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
