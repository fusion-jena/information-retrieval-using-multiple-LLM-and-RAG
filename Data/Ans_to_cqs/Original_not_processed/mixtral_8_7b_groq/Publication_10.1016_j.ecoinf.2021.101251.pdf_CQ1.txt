The provided context discusses data management and citation in the Earth and Environmental Science Data Information System (ESS-DIVE), particularly in the context of the ESS program and its funded projects such as AmeriFlux. However, it does not directly address the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, the methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline can vary widely depending on the specific application and domain. Some common methods include:

1. Surveys: Surveys can be used to collect data from human respondents, either through online forms or in-person interviews.
2. Sensors: Sensors can be used to collect data from the environment, such as temperature, humidity, or motion data.
3. Public datasets: Public datasets, such as those available through government agencies or data repositories, can be used to collect data for analysis.

In the context of ESS-DIVE and the ESS program, the funded projects are required to submit data to ESS-DIVE for long-term stewardship. This data is collected through various methods, such as sensors and field measurements, and is then processed and submitted to ESS-DIVE.

The context also discusses the challenges of citing and giving credit to the underlying datasets when creating data collections, as well as the potential solutions to these challenges. However, it does not provide specific information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, while the provided context discusses data management and citation in the ESS program and its funded projects, it does not provide information on the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. Common methods for collecting raw data in deep learning include surveys, sensors, and public datasets.
