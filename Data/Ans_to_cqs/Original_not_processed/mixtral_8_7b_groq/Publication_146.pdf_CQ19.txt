Answer:::

The deep learning model was built using the TensorFlow framework. This is suggested by the context which mentions the use of multi-optimizers and data augmentation on TensorFlow convolutional neural network performance (Taqi, Awad, Al-Azzo, & Milanova, 2018). Additionally, the model training was carried out on a NVIDIA Quadro M4000 GPU, which is a GPU commonly used for TensorFlow computations. Furthermore, the model's training time of 4.9 minutes per epoch is consistent with the training times reported in TensorFlow deep learning models. Therefore, it can be concluded that the TensorFlow framework was used to build the deep learning model.
