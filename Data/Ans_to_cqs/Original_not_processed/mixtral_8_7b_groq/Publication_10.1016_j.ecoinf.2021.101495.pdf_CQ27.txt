Answer:::

The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved several steps, including model serialization and platform selection.

Firstly, the deep learning models for fish segmentation and classification were trained using the Nvidia Tesla V100 (16GB) computing infrastructure. The classifier was based on a residual neural network, specifically the ResNet50V2 model implemented in TensorFlow and pre-trained with the ImageNet dataset. The segmentation model was obtained from the TensorFlow Object Detection API. Hyperparameters such as epochs, batch size, learning rate, activation function, and train/test split were manually tuned to obtain the best assignments for each model.

Once the models were trained, they were serialized to save the trained weights and architecture for future use. Model serialization is an essential step in deep learning model deployment as it allows the model to be used in different platforms and environments.

The serialized models were then deployed on a platform for fish species classification. The platform selection would depend on the specific requirements of the application, such as computational resources, real-time processing, and integration with other systems.

For instance, if the application requires real-time fish species classification on a mobile device, a lightweight deep learning framework such as TensorFlow Lite could be used for model deployment. TensorFlow Lite is a lean version of TensorFlow that is optimized for mobile and embedded devices. It supports model quantization, which reduces the model size without significantly affecting the accuracy.

On the other hand, if the application requires high-performance fish species classification on a server, a high-performance deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch could be used for model deployment. These frameworks support distributed computing, which allows the model to be run on multiple GPUs or CPUs for faster processing.

In summary, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved training the models using the Nvidia Tesla V100 (16GB) computing infrastructure, tuning hyperparameters, serializing the models, and selecting a platform for deployment based on the specific requirements of the application.
