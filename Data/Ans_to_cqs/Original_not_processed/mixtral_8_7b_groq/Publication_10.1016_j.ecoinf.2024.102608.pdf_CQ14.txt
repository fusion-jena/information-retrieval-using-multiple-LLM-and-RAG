Answer:::

The hyperparameters of the models used in the study are optimized using a method called randomized grid search. This approach is different from the traditional grid search, as it offers several advantages, including reducing computational cost and finding equally or more optimal solutions than an exhaustive grid search, particularly when some hyperparameters are more influential than others (Bergstra and Bengio, 2012; Lee et al., 2022).

Randomized grid search provides a balance between model complexity and the dataset, reducing the risk of overfitting. In this method, various cases are generated by combining hyperparameter values extracted from a uniform distribution, and their performance is evaluated. The hyperparameters, their ranges, and the intervals used in the grid search are summarized in Table S4 of the supplementary file.

The main research objectives of the study include demonstrating the performance of machine learning models for predicting CHL-a, SD, and TSS using surface reflectance values from Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI imagery. To optimize the performance of these models, hyperparameter tuning was conducted using randomized grid search.

The study selected the set of hyperparameter values that resulted in the minimum MAE and RMSE, as well as the highest R2, for each machine learning model. The resulting hyperparameter values for the four machine learning models are presented in Table 1 of the study.

In summary, the hyperparameters of the models in this study are optimized using a randomized grid search method, which offers advantages over traditional grid search, reduces the risk of overfitting, and helps find optimal solutions for the machine learning models used in the study.
