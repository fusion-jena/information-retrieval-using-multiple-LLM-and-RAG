Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that when applying deep learning models over a longer period of time, the training dataset and the dataset on which the model is applied can have different data distributions due to various reasons such as different recording conditions or devices. To address this issue, the field of machine learning called domain adaptation is used to increase the transferability of models to datasets with similar statistical properties.

In the context of the study, the authors focused on small-scale remote sensing data obtained by hand-held camera devices and developed a domain adaptation approach and a joint energy-based semantic segmentation model (JESS) with broad applicability. Although the specific data augmentation techniques are not mentioned, it can be inferred that data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling could have been used in the deep learning pipeline to increase the size of the training data and improve the model's performance. These techniques are commonly used in deep learning to generate new training samples by applying transformations to the existing data, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize and reducing overfitting.

Therefore, while the specific data augmentation techniques used in the study are not mentioned, it is reasonable to assume that techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling were used in the deep learning pipeline.
