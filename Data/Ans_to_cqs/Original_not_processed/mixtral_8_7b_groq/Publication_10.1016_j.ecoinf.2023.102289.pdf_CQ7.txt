Answer:
The context does not provide explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, it mentions that MXNet, an open-source AI platform, is used for computations in this study. MXNet, along with other tools like GluonCV, provides functionalities for AI development, including data loading and model training. Common practices in deep learning usually involve splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets, which could be applied in this case. The specific ratio and method of splitting the data might depend on the dataset size, the complexity of the model, and the preferences of the researchers. It is also possible that cross-validation techniques are used, especially when the dataset size is limited. However, without specific details provided in the context, the exact criteria for data splitting remain unknown.
