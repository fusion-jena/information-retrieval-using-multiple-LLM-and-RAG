The provided context does not discuss the specific data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. However, it does mention the use of big data from a public repository (GBIF) and additional reliable records observed in the field for training artificial intelligence models to predict biodiversity changes.

In general, data annotation techniques in deep learning pipelines for computer vision tasks like object detection and segmentation involve labeling the data to help the model learn to identify and locate objects of interest. Some common data annotation techniques include:

1. Bounding box annotation: This involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image. The box defines the object's location and size, and the model learns to detect and classify objects based on these boxes.
2. Instance segmentation: This is a more detailed form of annotation where the model learns to segment individual objects from the background and other objects in the image. Each object is labeled with a unique identifier, allowing the model to distinguish between different instances of the same object.
3. Semantic segmentation: This is a form of image segmentation where the model learns to classify each pixel in an image into a specific category or class. This technique is useful for applications where the model needs to understand the composition of an image at a pixel level.

These data annotation techniques are important for training deep learning models for computer vision tasks, and the choice of technique depends on the specific application and the level of detail required for the model to make accurate predictions.
