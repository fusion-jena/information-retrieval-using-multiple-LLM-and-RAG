Answer:::

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline for weed detection include jitter, mosaic, random crop, and scale augmentations. Jitter augmentation involves adding small random displacements to the pixel values of the input images, while mosaic augmentation combines four randomly selected images into a single image, creating a mosaic-like effect. This technique helps the model to learn from a more diverse set of images and improves its ability to generalize. On the other hand, random crop and scale augmentations involve randomly cropping and rescaling the input images to different sizes, which helps the model to learn invariance to image scale and orientation.

In addition to these techniques, the deep learning pipeline also involves resizing the original high-resolution weed images to a fixed input size of 800 Ã— 800 pixels. This is done by rescaling the long side of each image to 800 and adding padding to the short side to maintain the original image aspect ratio. This technique helps to ensure compatibility with the model architectures and improve training efficiency.

It is worth noting that different learning rate schemes were implemented to train the I3Net modules for weed detection. Specifically, an initial learning rate of 0.001 was set for training the I3Net modules to ensure effective learning of source-domain information, which was less disturbed by the target domain images. Afterward, the learning rate was reinitialized to 0.01 to enhance feature adaptation to the target domain.

Overall, the use of these data augmentation techniques and learning rate schemes helps to improve the robustness and accuracy of the deep learning pipeline for weed detection, enabling effective in-season and cross-season weed detection.
