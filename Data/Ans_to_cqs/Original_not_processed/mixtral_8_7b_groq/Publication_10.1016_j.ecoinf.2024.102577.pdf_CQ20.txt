Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context includes several articles and abstracts related to machine learning, sustainable fishing, and tropical tuna, but none of them mention the hardware used for training the deep learning model.

However, it can be inferred that the training of the deep learning model likely required significant computational resources. For instance, one of the articles is a systematic review of AI applications in sustainable fisheries, which suggests that deep learning models were used in some of the studies. Deep learning models are known for their high computational demands, and using them typically requires specialized hardware such as GPUs or TPUs.

Furthermore, one of the articles cites the use of R, a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. R can run on various hardware platforms, including Windows, Mac, and Linux, but it does not specify whether the computations were performed on a CPU or a GPU.

Therefore, while the context does not provide explicit information on the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, it can be inferred that the training likely required specialized hardware due to the computational demands of deep learning models.
