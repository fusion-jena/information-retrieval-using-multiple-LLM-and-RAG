Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about the use of any deep learning models for training or about the specific hardware resources used, such as GPUs or TPUs. The text describes a study that uses a tree-based fuzzy inference system (FIS) for ecological landscape unit provision. The FIS architecture consists of two input Prox-FIS and LCWT-FIS, and the output of Apis-FIS has triangular and trapezoidal membership functions with five fuzzy sets. However, there is no mention of deep learning models or hardware resources used for training.

The study uses various data types, including raster and vector data, with different temporal and spatial resolutions. The data sources include the Land Use/Land Cover Map (LULC), Lidar-derived digital elevation models (MNT-Lidar), weather data, a database of parcels and declared agricultural production (BDPPAD), and the Quebec hydrographic network (GRHQ). The study compares landscapes unit provision based on expert data from the literature against those from a field survey, using the Nova Scotia Forest Ecosystem Classification at 10 m resolution.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query regarding the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model since there is no information about it in the given context.
