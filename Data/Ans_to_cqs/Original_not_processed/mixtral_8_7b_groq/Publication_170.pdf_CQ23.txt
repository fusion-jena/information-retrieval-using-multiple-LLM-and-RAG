The generalizability of a deep learning model refers to its ability to perform well on new, unseen data. Several measures were taken in the study to ensure the generalizability of the DCNN model.

Firstly, a diverse dataset was used for training the model. The BMXSM dataset, which contains images from various camera sites, was used for training the model. The diversity of the dataset helps the model to learn a wide range of features and patterns, thereby improving its ability to generalize to new data.

Secondly, the model was trained on different training sets of varying sizes. This incremental training mode helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to a particular training set, and it can learn from different subsets of the data. The figure shows the error values for the models trained on different training sets, and it can be observed that the error values are not significantly different, indicating that the model is not overfitting.

Thirdly, the study recommended determining the minimum sample size according to the user's error tolerance and the number of camera sites. A larger sample size helps to ensure that the model is trained on a diverse and representative dataset, which in turn improves its ability to generalize to new data.

Fourthly, the model was trained on a GPU server, which allows for faster training times and the ability to train on larger datasets. This can help to ensure that the model is trained on a sufficiently large and diverse dataset to learn the necessary features and patterns.

Lastly, while the study does not explicitly mention cross-validation or stratified splitting, these techniques are commonly used in deep learning to ensure the generalizability of the model. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple folds, training the model on one fold, and testing it on another fold. This helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data and can generalize to new data. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset such that each fold has a similar distribution of classes. This is particularly important in imbalanced datasets where one class may be overrepresented in the training data.

In summary, the study took several measures to ensure the generalizability of the DCNN model, including using a diverse dataset, incremental training, determining the minimum sample size, training on a GPU server, and potentially using cross-validation and stratified splitting.
