Based on the provided context, there is no information that directly states the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. However, there are some papers that discuss the use of machine learning techniques for biodiversity analysis.

For instance, the paper "Data integration enables global biodiversity synthesis" by Heberling et al. (2021) mentions the use of machine learning algorithms for predicting species distributions. However, it does not specify the type of deep learning model used.

The paper "Discriminating well surveyed spatial units from exhaustive biodiversity databases" by Guisande and Lobo (2019) uses the R package "KnowBR" for biodiversity analysis. While the package uses machine learning techniques, it does not mention the use of deep learning models.

The paper "No one-size-fits-all solution to clean GBIF" by Zizka et al. (2020) discusses the challenges of cleaning and standardizing biodiversity data. While it mentions the use of machine learning techniques for data cleaning, it does not specify the type of deep learning model used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.

Answer:::
The provided context does not contain information on the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
