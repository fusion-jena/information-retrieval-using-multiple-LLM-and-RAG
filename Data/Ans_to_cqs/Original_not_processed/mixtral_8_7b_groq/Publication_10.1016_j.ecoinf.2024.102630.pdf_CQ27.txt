I don't have enough information to provide an accurate answer to the query. The provided context discusses the data used in a study, including various NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) datasets from MODIS, AVHRR, and GIMMS sensors, as well as information about land cover area changes. However, it does not mention anything about deploying a trained deep learning model, including the steps taken for model serialization or platform selection. Therefore, I cannot provide a reliable answer to this question based on the given context.
