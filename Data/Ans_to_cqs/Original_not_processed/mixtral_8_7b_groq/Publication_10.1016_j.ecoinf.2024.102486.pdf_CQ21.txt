Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. However, we can infer some possible postprocessing steps based on the context.

The context mentions that "Gaussian kernel density estimation was used, with bandwidth equal to one fifth of the sample standard deviation of posterior samples for each respective parameter" for visualizing posterior marginal distributions. This suggests that some form of density estimation or probability distribution calculation is performed during postprocessing.

Furthermore, the context mentions that the study focuses on "animal audio classification" and "disease dynamics modellers" as applications. Therefore, it is possible that the postprocessing steps include calculating various metrics relevant to these applications, such as classification accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or epidemiological metrics such as R0, prevalence, or incidence.

However, the context does not explicitly mention any other postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices. Saliency maps are typically used in computer vision tasks to visualize the importance of different input features for the model's prediction. However, the context does not mention any computer vision tasks or image data. Similarly, confusion matrices are typically used to evaluate the performance of classification models by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels. However, the context does not explicitly mention any classification model evaluation steps.

Therefore, while some forms of probability distribution calculation and metrics calculation are likely to be involved in the postprocessing steps, the context does not provide enough information to definitively answer the query about specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrices.
