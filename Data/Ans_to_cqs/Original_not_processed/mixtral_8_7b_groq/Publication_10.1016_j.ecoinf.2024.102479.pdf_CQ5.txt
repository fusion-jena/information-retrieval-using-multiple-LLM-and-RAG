Answer:::

The provided context does not include specific information about the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some datasets used in other machine learning contexts, such as k-fold cross-validation, which can be used to assess the performance of deep learning models.

In the context of k-fold cross-validation, the dataset used is a set of 138 ground-based Aboveground Biomass (AGB) estimates, which were reduced from an initial set of 152 estimates after eliminating outliers. This dataset was split into two distinct sets, with 70% used for model training and the remaining 30% used as a testing dataset.

In general, the choice of dataset for a deep learning pipeline depends on the specific task or application. Some commonly used datasets for deep learning include MNIST for image classification, CIFAR for object recognition, and ImageNet for large-scale image recognition. These datasets are widely used because they provide a standard benchmark for evaluating the performance of deep learning models.

Therefore, while the provided context does not specify the datasets used in a deep learning pipeline, it is mentioned that k-fold cross-validation was used to assess the performance of the models. Additionally, some commonly used datasets for deep learning include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet.
