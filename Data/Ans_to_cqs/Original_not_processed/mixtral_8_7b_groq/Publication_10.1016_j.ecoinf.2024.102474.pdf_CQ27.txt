Answer:::

The context does not provide detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does offer some insights that can help us infer the possible steps taken.

The model was trained using the EarthNet2021 Challenge data, which consists of 23,904 training datacubes located across Europe. The specific deep learning model used is not mentioned, but it is noted that a ConvLSTM model was used in a related study by the same authors.

The model training was conducted on NVIDIA GTX 1080 GPU, and the optimization was stopped once the validation ENS repeatedly failed to improve. The model at the epoch with the highest attained validation score was selected. This suggests that the training process likely included model validation and versioning, where multiple models were trained and evaluated, and the best-performing one was selected for deployment.

As for model serialization, the context does not provide explicit information. However, it is a common practice in deep learning model development to serialize the model, i.e., save the model architecture and weights to a file, for later use. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the trained model was likely serialized for deployment.

Regarding platform selection, the context does not provide information on where or how the model was deployed. It could have been deployed on a local machine, a server, or a cloud platform, depending on the use case and resource requirements.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it is possible to infer that the process likely included model validation, versioning, serialization, and platform selection.
