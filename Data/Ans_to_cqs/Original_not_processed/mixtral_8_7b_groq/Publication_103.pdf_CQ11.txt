Answer:::

 The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text mentions the use of herbarium data and a dataset from the National Museum of Costa Rica, but it does not specify where this data is stored or how it can be accessed. Additionally, there is no mention of any data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested link.
