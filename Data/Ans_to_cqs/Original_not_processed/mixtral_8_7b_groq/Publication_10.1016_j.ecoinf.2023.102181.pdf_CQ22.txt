The provided context discusses the evaluation of a model's performance, but it does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models. Moreover, it focuses on the use of spatial density and covariance-weighted bagging approaches for model validation rather than traditional metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall.

However, the context does mention the use of two metrics for evaluating the model's performance: variance explained (̂ve) and root mean square error (̂rmse). The variance explained (̂ve) is a relative measure of performance, while the root mean square error (̂rmse) is an absolute performance metric, both in response units.

The variance explained (̂ve) measures the proportion of variance in the response variable that is explained by the model. It is a relative measure of performance because it is expressed as a percentage of the total variance. A higher value of ̂ve indicates that the model explains a larger proportion of the variance in the response variable, indicating better performance.

The root mean square error (̂rmse) measures the difference between the predicted and actual values of the response variable. It is an absolute performance metric because it is expressed in the same units as the response variable. A lower value of ̂rmse indicates that the model's predictions are closer to the actual values, indicating better performance.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of accuracy, precision, or recall for evaluating the performance of a deep learning model, it does mention the use of variance explained (̂ve) and root mean square error (̂rmse) as metrics for evaluating model performance.
