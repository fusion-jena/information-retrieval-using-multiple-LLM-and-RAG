The text does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe the use of data augmentation as a regularization method.

Data augmentation involves creating adjusted copies of existing data to increase the amount of information available for training. In this specific case, before input into the model, each image was randomly sampled and adjusted using one of the following options: the entire original image, horizontal flip, grayscale, blur, noise, or cropping. Specifically, 25% of images had grayscale applied, blur was up to 10px, noise was up to 10% of pixels, and a patch with the same size as the original image was randomly cropped from the image.

Data augmentation helps to reduce overfitting by increasing the size and diversity of the training set, which in turn improves the model's ability to generalize from the training data to new, unseen data. This is because data augmentation creates new training examples that are similar to, but not identical to, the original training examples. As a result, the model is forced to learn more general features that are applicable to a wider range of inputs, rather than memorizing the specific details of the training examples.

In addition to data augmentation, other regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization can also be used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models. Dropout involves randomly setting a fraction of the activations in a layer to zero during training, which helps to prevent over-reliance on any single neuron and encourages the model to learn more robust features. L2 regularization, on the other hand, involves adding a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This helps to prevent the model from assigning too much importance to any single weight and encourages the model to learn more balanced features.

Overall, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of dropout or L2 regularization, it does describe the use of data augmentation as a regularization method to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline.
