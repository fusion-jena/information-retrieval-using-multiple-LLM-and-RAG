Answer:::

The provided context does not contain information on deep learning pipelines or strategies for handling randomness in such pipelines. However, I can provide some general strategies employed in deep learning to handle randomness.

In deep learning, randomness can be introduced through various means, such as random initialization of weights, dropout, data shuffling, and random selection of mini-batches during training. These techniques help improve model performance, prevent overfitting, and provide a measure of uncertainty. Here are some strategies to handle randomness:

1. **Fixed random seed value**: To ensure reproducibility, a fixed random seed value is set at the beginning of the training process. This ensures that the same sequence of random numbers is generated during each run, making the training process deterministic.

2. **Model initialization**: Deep learning models typically initialize weights randomly. Different initialization methods, such as Xavier initialization or He initialization, can be used to ensure that the initial weights are within a reasonable range.

3. **Dropout**: Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly drops out a fraction of neurons during training. This helps prevent overfitting and encourages the model to learn more robust features.

4. **Data shuffling**: Shuffling the training data before each epoch ensures that the model does not learn the data in a specific order, reducing the risk of overfitting.

5. **Mini-batch sampling**: During training, the dataset is divided into mini-batches, and a random subset of these mini-batches is selected for each training iteration. This introduces stochasticity into the training process and helps the model converge faster.

6. **Ensemble methods**: Ensemble methods, such as bagging or boosting, can be used to reduce the impact of randomness on model performance. These methods combine the predictions of multiple models trained on different subsets of the data, reducing the variance of the predictions.

While the provided context does not contain information on the specific query, the above strategies are commonly used in deep learning to handle randomness.
