Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in the context provided makes use of audio data specifically in the form of spectrograms. A spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies in a signal as it varies with time, often used in the analysis of sound signals. In this case, the spectrograms are derived from covey call recordings, which are then analyzed using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

The CNN model is trained on these spectrograms, which are a type of image data, to detect and localize all covey calls within the Automatic Recording Units (ARU) during the recording period. The model notes the associated time and peak power (dB) of each detected covey call. The model then uses a score threshold to classify the detections, with only calls that receive a score of 0.95 or higher being officially classified as a positive bobwhite detection.

The model's performance is then evaluated by manually reviewing all CNN detections at a 0.95 score threshold from a random sample of five one-hour files from each year. This process calculates a false positive rate, which is the number of calls incorrectly labeled as bobwhite.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in this context uses spectrograms derived from audio recordings as the primary data format. These spectrograms are treated as image data within the CNN model. Additionally, CSV files may be used for storing and analyzing the results of the model, such as the times, peak powers, and classifications of detected covey calls.
