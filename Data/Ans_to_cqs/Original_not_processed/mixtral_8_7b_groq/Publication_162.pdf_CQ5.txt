The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the text are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that they normalize all input channels (red, green, blue, and depth) by subtracting the respective mean and dividing by the respective standard deviation over the whole dataset. This suggests that they have a dataset of RGB-D images, where RGB stands for Red, Green, Blue color channels and D for depth.

Additionally, they use pre-trained weights from the Microsoft COCO dataset for the region proposal network (RPN) classifier and mask head. The Microsoft COCO dataset is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. It contains 330,000 images and 1.5 million object instances belonging to 80 categories.

It's also worth noting that the pipeline is evaluated on instances of deer as it is the most common species in their RGB-D dataset. They quantify the results using the average precision (AP), AP50, and AP75 metrics as defined by the Microsoft COCO dataset.

So, in summary, the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the text are an RGB-D dataset for training and testing the model and the Microsoft COCO dataset for pre-trained weights.
