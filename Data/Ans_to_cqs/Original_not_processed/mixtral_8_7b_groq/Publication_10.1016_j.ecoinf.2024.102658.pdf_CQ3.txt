The provided context does not include information about the data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the use of different feature sets and models for machine learning in the field of ecology, specifically for building Species Distribution Models (SDMs). It discusses the use of bootstrap sampling, binary split decisions, and a random subset of features in the Random Forest model, but it does not mention any data annotation techniques. Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot answer the query about data annotation techniques used in deep learning.
