Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for the study in question. However, it is mentioned that a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model was used for waste disposal rate estimation (Vu et al., 2022). In general, optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop are commonly used in deep learning pipelines to update the weights and biases of the neural network during training. These optimization algorithms aim to minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance.

For instance, in the study by Vu et al. (2022), the authors used the k-fold cross-validation method for evaluating the performance of various machine learning algorithms, including the RNN model. However, they did not explicitly mention the optimization technique employed in their deep learning pipeline.

In other studies, such as those by Wang et al. (2022) and Asadollah et al. (2021), the optimization techniques used in their deep learning pipelines are not specified either. It is essential to consider that different optimization techniques might be used depending on the specific problem, dataset, and deep learning architecture.

In summary, while optimization techniques like SGD, Adam, and RMSprop are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, the provided context does not offer enough information to determine which optimization technique was applied in the study focused on waste disposal rate estimation.
