The provided context does not directly discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of various datasets in the context of training machine learning models for land cover classification and carbon stock estimation.

In the study by Staiano (2019), the authors used 10 input datasets for training their models. These datasets likely consist of remote sensing data collected through various sensors, although the specific sources are not mentioned. The sensors could include aerial or satellite-based instruments that measure spectral reflectance or other properties of the Earth's surface.

The study by Matiza, et al. (2024) specifically uses Planetscope spectral data for quantifying above-ground carbon stock in an urban reforested landscape. Planetscope is a commercial satellite constellation operated by Planet Labs, which provides high-resolution multispectral imagery.

In addition to sensors, public datasets are also a common source of raw data for deep learning applications. For example, in the field of computer vision, large-scale image datasets such as ImageNet or COCO are widely used for training models. These datasets are created through crowdsourcing efforts, where contributors label images with various attributes or objects.

Surveys, on the other hand, are less commonly used as a source of raw data for deep learning, as they typically involve subjective human responses rather than objective measurements. However, surveys can be used to collect ground truth data for evaluating the performance of machine learning models.

Overall, while the provided context does not directly answer the query, it suggests that remote sensing data collected through sensors and satellite imagery are common sources of raw data for deep learning applications in the field of ecological informatics. Public datasets and surveys may also be used, but their relevance depends on the specific application.
