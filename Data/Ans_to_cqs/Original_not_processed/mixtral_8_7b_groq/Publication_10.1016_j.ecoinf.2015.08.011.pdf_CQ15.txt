The provided context discusses the use of a trial-and-error method and early stopping as optimization techniques in the development of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. However, it does not explicitly mention any specific optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.

In the trial-and-error method, different configurations of the ANN model, such as the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the learning rate, were tested to determine the optimal number of neurons and learning rate that result in the maximum model performance. This approach is a manual way of searching for the best hyperparameters without relying on any mathematical formulation.

On the other hand, early stopping is a regularization technique used to prevent overfitting in the model. The dataset is split into two sets, a training set and a validation set. The training process is stopped when the network begins to overfit the data, i.e., the error on the validation set starts to increase. This technique helps to ensure that the model can generalize well to new data.

While the context does not mention any specific optimization algorithms, it is worth noting that Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam are commonly used optimization algorithms in deep learning pipelines. SGD is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters by taking a step in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. Adam, on the other hand, is an adaptive optimization algorithm that adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on its past gradients.

Therefore, while the provided context discusses the use of the trial-and-error method and early stopping as optimization techniques, it does not explicitly mention any specific optimization algorithms such as SGD or Adam.
