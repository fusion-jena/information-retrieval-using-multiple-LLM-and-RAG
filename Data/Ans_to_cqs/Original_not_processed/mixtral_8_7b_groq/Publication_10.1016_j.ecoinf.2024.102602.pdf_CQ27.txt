The text provided does not give specific details about the process of deploying the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that the models were optimized using the Adam optimizer algorithm, a batch size of 10, and 100 epochs. The learning rates were chosen based on empirical trials over 100 epochs. The best results were obtained with the EfficientNetB0 model, which had a learning rate of 10 and achieved high accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and f1-score.

In terms of model serialization, the text mentions that the confusion matrices for the models are presented in Tables A.6 and A.7, which suggests that the models were saved in some format that allowed for the generation of these matrices. However, the specific format or method of serialization is not mentioned.

As for platform selection, there is no information provided about where or how the model was deployed. It is possible that the model was deployed on a local machine for testing and evaluation, but the text does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion.

Therefore, while the text provides some details about the training and optimization of the deep learning models, it does not give a complete picture of the process of deploying the trained model.
