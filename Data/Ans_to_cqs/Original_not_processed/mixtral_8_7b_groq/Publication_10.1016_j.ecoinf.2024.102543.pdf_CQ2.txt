Answer: The text provided for context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does give substantial information about the processing and evaluation of image data.

From the context, we can infer that the primary data format used is related to image data, since the preprocessing and augmentation techniques mentioned (such as auto-orientation, resizing, tiling, filtering, and saturation adjustments) are commonly applied to image datasets. It is also mentioned that the images have a uniform size of 640 x 640 pixels, and that the model processes these images for tasks like NBSB detection and counting.

As for other data formats (like audio, video, or CSV), there is no explicit information in the text that indicates their use. The evaluation metrics mentioned, such as Precision, Recall, mAP0.5 and mAP0.5:0.95, are commonly used for object detection tasks in image data. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the deep learning pipeline in this context deals primarily with image data.
