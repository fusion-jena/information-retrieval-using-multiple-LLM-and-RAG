Answer: The deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, three types of CNNs are employed: PConv networks, Pix2Pix networks, and pre-trained classification networks.

1. PConv networks: These networks are used for image inpainting tasks, where the goal is to fill in missing regions of an image in a visually plausible manner. The PConv network used here is a modified version of the original implementation, which requires a two-phase training process due to issues with batch normalization. In this study, however, all models were trained in a single process while freezing the batch normalization layer in the encoder part. The network uses pre-trained weights, and models were optimized using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0002 and ReLU activation for the encoder part and leakyRelu activation for the decoder part.

2. Pix2Pix networks: These networks are used for image-to-image translation tasks, where the goal is to learn a mapping between an input image and an output image. In this study, the Pix2Pix network was trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 9e-5 and a batch size of 1. The network was trained for 50 epochs, and models were evaluated using the validation set and saved as the best model based on validation loss.

3. Pre-trained classification networks: These networks are used for plant species identification tasks. The study adapted the VGG16 network, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, and replaced the fully connected layers with a global max-pooling layer, a dropout layer, and a single hidden layer. The networks were trained for 20 epochs with a batch size of 32 and various data augmentation techniques.

In summary, the deep learning models used in the pipeline are CNNs, specifically PConv networks for image inpainting, Pix2Pix networks for image-to-image translation, and pre-trained classification networks for plant species identification. All input images were preprocessed by mean centering the image with ImageNet values and then rescaling between 0 and 1.
