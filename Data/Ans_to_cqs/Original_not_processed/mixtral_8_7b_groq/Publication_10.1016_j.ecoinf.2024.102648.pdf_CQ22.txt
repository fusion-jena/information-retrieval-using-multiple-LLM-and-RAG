The performance of the deep learning model for predicting Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD) is evaluated using the following metrics: R-squared (R2), Root Average Squared Errors (RASE), and Average Absolute Error (AAE). These metrics are used to compare the deep learning model with other statistical and machine learning models such as Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Bootstrap Forest, and Boosted Tree.

The R-squared value measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. The deep learning model has an R-squared value of 0.59, which means that it can explain 59% of the variance in CLCuD. However, other models such as Bootstrap Forest and Boosted Tree have higher R-squared values of 0.78 and 0.69, respectively.

The Root Average Squared Errors (RASE) measures the average magnitude of the errors in the predicted values. The deep learning model has a RASE value of 24.53, which is higher than the Bootstrap Forest model (17.96) but lower than the Boosted Tree model (21.44).

The Average Absolute Error (AAE) measures the average magnitude of the absolute errors in the predicted values. The deep learning model has an AAE value of 13.03, which is lower than the Bootstrap Forest model (16.17) but higher than the Boosted Tree model (16.02).

In summary, the deep learning model has a moderate performance in predicting CLCuD with an R-squared value of 0.59, RASE value of 24.53, and AAE value of 13.03. Other models such as Bootstrap Forest and Boosted Tree have higher R-squared values and lower RASE and AAE values, indicating better performance. However, the deep learning model has the advantage of learning complex patterns and relationships in the data, which may not be captured by the other models. Therefore, a holistic model that combines the strengths of different models may provide better accuracy and reliability for the prediction of CLCuD.
