After reviewing the provided context, I was unable to find information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several studies related to environmental pollution, water quality management, and remote sensing, but none of them mention the data repository for the deep learning pipeline.

The studies do mention various data sources, such as the China National Environmental Monitoring Centre (CNEMC) and remote sensing data from Poyang Lake in China. However, these sources do not appear to be related to the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as I could not locate the necessary information in the given context.
