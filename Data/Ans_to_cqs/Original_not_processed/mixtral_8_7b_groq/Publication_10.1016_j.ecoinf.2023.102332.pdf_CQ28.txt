Answer:::

The provided context does not give information about which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. The texts mention several models and platforms, but none of them directly relates to the deployment platform for a specific deep learning model.

The GÃ¼nther et al. (2015) and Baroni et al. (2014) texts describe the creation and evaluation of a high-quality word vector space called "gen.de/z2/LSAspaces" using the CBOW algorithm. However, these texts do not mention any cloud platforms related to the deployment of the model.

Devlin et al. (2018) introduce the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, a powerful deep learning model for natural language processing tasks. Yet, the text does not mention any cloud platforms related to the deployment of the model.

Edwards et al. (2022), Egarter Vigl et al. (2021), Feinerer and Hornik (2018), Fox et al. (2021a, 2021b), and Ghermandi and Sinclair (2019) discuss various topics related to text mining, social media data, and natural language processing, but none of them mention the deployment platform for a deep learning model.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
