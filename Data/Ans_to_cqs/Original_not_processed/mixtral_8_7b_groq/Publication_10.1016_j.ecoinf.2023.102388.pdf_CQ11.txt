Answer:::
I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context mainly discusses the methodology of query-based attacks on machine learning models, specifically in the context of ecological informatics. It describes how to determine membership status using label-only attacks and the experimental configuration of three different datasets. However, there is no mention of any data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
