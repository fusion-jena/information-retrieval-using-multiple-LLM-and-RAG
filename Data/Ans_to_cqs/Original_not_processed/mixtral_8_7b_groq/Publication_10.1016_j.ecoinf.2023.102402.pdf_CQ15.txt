The provided context does not include information about the optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. The context focuses on the use of Maxent models in bioclimatic modelling and the evaluation of these models using the Akaike Information Criterion (AICc). Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query about optimization techniques in a deep learning pipeline.
