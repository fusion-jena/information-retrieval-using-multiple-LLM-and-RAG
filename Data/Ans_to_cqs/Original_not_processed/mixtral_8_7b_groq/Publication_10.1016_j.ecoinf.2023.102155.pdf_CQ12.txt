Answer:

The provided context does not specify any type of deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers being used in the pipeline. The focus of the study is on extending the tools developed in Guilbault et al. (2021) by incorporating bias correction and lasso-type penalties for observer bias correction and model complexity control. The methods used for comparison in the study are based on mixture modeling (EM algorithm) and machine learning (semi-supervised learning), and the paper tests their performance in the context of low species abundance. The study presents predicted intensity maps for different combinations of lasso regularization and bias correction, but it does not mention any deep learning models.
