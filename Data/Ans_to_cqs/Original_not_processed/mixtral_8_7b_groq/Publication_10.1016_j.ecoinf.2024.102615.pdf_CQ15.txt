The text provided does not give specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. However, it does describe a grid search approach used to optimize the hyperparameters of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model.

In the first stage of the optimization process, the neural network structure and the number of neurons in the hidden layers are adjusted. Specifically, 60 sets of combinations including one to five hidden layers and neurons with a range of 64-2048 (nth power of 2) are considered.

In the second stage, the percentage of the dropout layers, the learning rate, and the batch size are adjusted, resulting in a total of 192 combinations (4*4*3*4). The learning rate is one of the hyperparameters that are tuned, but the specific optimization technique used for updating the weights is not mentioned.

The grid search method is used to optimize the MLP model's hyperparameters by comparing the values of evaluation metrics for different parameters and selecting the optimal parameters from the search space. The evaluation metric used in this study is the R-value of the validation set, which is maximized during the optimization process.

Therefore, while the text provides information on the hyperparameter optimization method used in the deep learning pipeline, it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used for updating the weights of the model.
