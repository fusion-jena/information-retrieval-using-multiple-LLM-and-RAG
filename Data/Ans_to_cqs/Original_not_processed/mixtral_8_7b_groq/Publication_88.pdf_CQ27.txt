The text provided does not give a detailed description of the process used to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does provide some context that can help us infer a general idea of the process.

The deep learning model in question is an EF network architecture, which consists of three convolutional layers, two max-pooling layers, two fully connected layers, and a softmax layer at the end. This model is trained using a batch size of 32, with 100 number of epochs, early stopping after 10 epochs with no improvement, a dropout rate of 0.2 in the final FC layer, and the Adam optimizer with weight decay equal to 0.9 and learning rate equal to 10âˆ’3. The binary cross-entropy is used as the loss function.

The model is trained using samples from the Amazon and Cerrado databases, with the number of training samples varying in four scenarios. In each scenario, samples are collected from the training set of one, two, three, or four tiles. The validation set is used to stop training once the loss increases in 10 consecutive epochs.

However, the text does not provide information on how the trained model was serialized or the platform on which it was deployed. It is possible that the model was saved in a format that can be loaded and used for making predictions on new data. The platform on which the model was deployed could be a server, a cloud-based platform, or an edge device, but the text does not provide information on this.

Therefore, while the text provides some context on the training of the deep learning model, it does not provide a complete description of the process used to deploy the model.
