Based on the provided context, the focus of the preprocessing methods discussed is primarily on image enhancement and noise reduction to improve the performance of the object detection model (YOLOv8) rather than addressing data bias. Therefore, the text does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

However, it does discuss four preprocessing techniques: white balance, gamma correction, sharpening, and dehazing. These techniques aim to improve image quality and reduce noise, which can indirectly help mitigate some sources of data bias by ensuring that the model receives higher-quality input data.

For instance, white balance and gamma correction can help ensure that color and brightness are consistent across images, which can be important if these factors vary systematically with the classes being detected. Sharpening can help improve the clarity of object boundaries, which can be useful if objects are often blurry or indistinct. Dehazing can help remove atmospheric effects that might obscure objects in some images.

In summary, while the provided context does not discuss techniques specifically aimed at addressing data bias during preprocessing, it does describe image enhancement techniques that can indirectly help mitigate some sources of data bias by improving image quality. However, if the goal is to address data bias directly, other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection may be more appropriate.
