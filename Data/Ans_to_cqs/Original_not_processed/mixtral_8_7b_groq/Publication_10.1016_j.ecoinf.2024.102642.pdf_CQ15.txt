Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of multi-annotation campaigns, distinctive annotation profiles, and two annotation aggregation methods (majority voting and soft labeling) to improve the accuracy and efficiency of cetacean vocalization detection. The text emphasizes the importance of annotation guidelines encouraging a more conservative approach to improve overall annotation quality. It also highlights the impact of annotation sets' permissiveness on model performance, with "permissive annotators" having lower performance than "conservative annotators," even with comparable F1 scores.

The study focuses on the influence of annotation strategies and the application of annotation aggregation methods to optimize the potential of multi-annotation and mitigate the presence of noisy labels. The evaluation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on annotations from both novices and experts demonstrates variations in model performance. The results suggest that simple convolutional neural network models generalize better from the most obvious examples, and the introduction of false positives deteriorates performance more than the omission of a vocalization in the annotation set.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention specific optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam, it discusses various methods to optimize the deep learning pipeline, focusing on annotation strategies, guidelines, and aggregation methods.
