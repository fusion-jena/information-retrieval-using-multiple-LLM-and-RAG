Answer:::

The datasets used in deep learning pipelines include MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet, which are widely used for training and testing deep learning models. However, according to the provided context, two other datasets, Herbarium255 and Herbarium1K, were used in the deep learning pipeline for herbarium specimen classification.

Herbarium255 contains 255 species from Costa Rica, and it was divided into 70% training data and 30% test data for computing the top-1 and top-5 classification accuracy. Herbarium1K contains 1,000 species from France, and it was divided into 80% and 20% for training and testing, respectively, to keep the proportion of the data provided by the PC challenge.

Furthermore, the authors in [36] used the ImageNet dataset to pre-train their neural network and fine-tune it on the Herbarium255 training set. This approach, known as transfer learning, is commonly used in deep learning to leverage pre-trained models on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet and fine-tune them on smaller, task-specific datasets such as Herbarium255.

Therefore, in addition to MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet, Herbarium255 and Herbarium1K are two other datasets used in deep learning pipelines for herbarium specimen classification.
