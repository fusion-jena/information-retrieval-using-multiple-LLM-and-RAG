Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there is no explicit description of a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The text mainly focuses on the experimental setup, the results of these experiments, and the insights gained from them. However, it does provide some information about the training and test sets used for the models, as well as the precision results for each experiment.

The authors conducted several initial experiments to evaluate different aspects of their feature extraction and recognition framework, including architecture, data augmentation, feature extraction enhancement, and handling different poses. These experiments resulted in varying levels of precision, with some achieving over 80% in certain measures and others achieving less than 50%. Specifically, for the P6 measure, all initial experiments resulted in precision of less than 50%.

The context also mentions that the methods explored in the initial experiments, which did not produce fruitful results, support future research by indicating not to repeat these methodologies. This suggests that the authors did monitor the performance of their models during training and were able to make informed decisions based on these results.

In summary, while there is no explicit description of a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, the context does provide some information about the training and test sets used for the models, as well as the precision results for each experiment. Additionally, the authors' decision to not repeat unsuccessful methodologies in future research suggests that they did monitor the performance of their models during training.
