Answer:::

The provided context does not include specific information about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. The context mainly discusses the use of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model and the Multiobjective Programming (MOP) model in the context of time series data prediction and land use optimization, respectively.

The LSTM model is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is commonly used for time series data prediction. However, the context does not mention any specific optimization techniques used during the training of the LSTM model.

On the other hand, the MOP model is used for optimizing land use demand in 2030, as shown in Table 8. However, the context does not provide information on the optimization techniques used in the MOP model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
