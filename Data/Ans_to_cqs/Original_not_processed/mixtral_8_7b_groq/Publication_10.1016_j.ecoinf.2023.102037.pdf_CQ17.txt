Answer:::
Based on the provided context, specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned. However, the text does discuss the importance of proper validation procedures in the evaluation of model performance, which is closely related to the concept of regularization.

Regularization methods, such as dropout and L2 regularization, are techniques used to prevent overfitting in deep learning models by adding a penalty to the loss function, which encourages the model to have simpler weights and avoid memorizing the training data. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to 0 during training, which helps to prevent over-reliance on any single feature and promotes the development of more robust features. L2 regularization, on the other hand, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the weights, which encourages the model to have smaller weights and avoid overfitting.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention these regularization techniques, it does highlight the importance of proper validation procedures in the evaluation of model performance. Specifically, it notes that model performance can be highly overestimated when weak validation procedures, like random data splitting, are followed. This suggests that the researchers recognize the importance of using rigorous validation procedures to evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting.

Therefore, while the specific regularization methods used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned in the provided context, it is reasonable to assume that the researchers employ some form of regularization to prevent overfitting and ensure the development of robust and accurate models.
