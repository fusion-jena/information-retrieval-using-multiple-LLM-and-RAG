In the deep learning pipeline for land use and climate studies, such as the one discussed in the provided context, raw data is primarily collected through satellite sensors and public datasets.

For instance, in the study mentioned, the Land Surface Temperature (LST) data is collected using satellite sensors. Specifically, they utilized the MODIS-TERRA sensor, which measures infrared radiations on channels 31 and 32. The data was obtained from the MOD11A2 product, which provides 8-day temporal and 1 km spatial resolutions, covering the period from 2005-2018. It's crucial to note that LST can only be accurately measured under clear-sky conditions.

Moreover, the Near-Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) data is collected from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS. The study used NDBI data from 2014 to 2018, applying machine learning to explore correlations between NDBI and various parameters.

In addition to satellite data, public datasets are another significant source of raw data in such studies. However, the provided context does not explicitly mention any public datasets being used in this specific study.

Therefore, the primary methods for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for land use and climate studies are through satellite sensors and public datasets.
