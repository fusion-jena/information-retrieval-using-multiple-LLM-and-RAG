Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is bird species classification.

In the Quinn et al. (2022) study, the authors used a deep learning model to classify soundscape recordings into different bird species categories. Specifically, they used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze ecoacoustic data and reveal temporal and geographic patterns in bird diversity. The CNN model was trained on a dataset of labeled bird sounds, allowing it to learn the distinct acoustic features of different bird species.

Similarly, in the BirdCLEF competitions mentioned in the Roca et al. (n.d.) abstract, the deep learning models were also used for bird species classification. However, these competitions used weakly-labeled audio data, which presents a significant obstacle for training accurate models.

The Pouyanfar et al. (2018) survey on deep learning provides further context for the use of deep learning models in bird species classification. They mention that deep learning has been successfully applied to various domains, including audio recognition, and that CNNs are commonly used for image and audio classification tasks.

Overall, the purpose of the deep learning models in the provided context is to classify bird species based on their acoustic features. These models use CNNs to learn the distinct patterns and features of different bird sounds, allowing for accurate classification and analysis of bird diversity in various ecosystems.
