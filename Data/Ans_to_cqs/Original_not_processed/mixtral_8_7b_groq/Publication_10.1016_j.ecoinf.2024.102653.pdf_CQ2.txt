Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the data used in the deep learning pipeline is in the form of flight activity recordings. The specific format of this data is not explicitly mentioned; however, it can be inferred that the data is likely in a structured format, such as a CSV file, since it is collected over time and used to train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model. RNNs are particularly well-suited to tasks involving sequential data, such as time series data. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the data is not in the form of images, audio, or video. However, the context does mention that the deep learning architecture includes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is commonly used for image classification tasks. It is possible that the CNN is used for a different part of the toxicovigilance tool or that the CNN is used in conjunction with the RNN to analyze the flight activity recordings. Without further information, it is not possible to definitively determine the data format, but it is most likely in a structured format such as a CSV file.
