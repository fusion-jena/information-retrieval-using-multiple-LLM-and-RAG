Answer:

The context provided does not give specific details about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it does provide some insights into the data and the training process used in a specific study.

In the study, the authors used a Siamese network for animal tracking, and they faced the challenge of training the network with a limited number of samples. To address this, they used few-shot learning, a method where the classification task is defined as the N-way K-shot problem, where the training set contains N different categories with each category comprising K labeled samples. In this case, two categories were defined: target and non-target.

The authors performed experiments using two-way one-shot learning, which means that each category in the training set contained only one labeled sample. This is an example of a very limited data scenario, where the conventional approach of splitting the data into train, test, and validation sets might not be feasible or optimal.

Additionally, the context provides information about the duration of the training process for the Siamese network, measured in seconds (927 s, 1374 s, and 678 s). It also mentions the number of features extracted from the video data (27,819, 41,225, and 20,340). However, these details do not provide direct insights into the data splitting criteria.

In summary, based on the provided context, the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation) are not mentioned. The study used few-shot learning due to the limited number of samples and performed experiments with two-way one-shot learning. The conventional data splitting approach might not be applicable in such limited data scenarios.
