Answer:::

The text does not explicitly mention the use of techniques such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does provide some information that suggests steps were taken to promote the model's ability to perform well on new data.

Firstly, separate two-class models were trained for Finnmark and Yamal, indicating that the model was adapted to specific sites. This approach acknowledges the potential differences in image quality and content between locations, which could help improve the model's performance on new, unseen data from similar contexts.

Secondly, the models were based on the ResNet-5
