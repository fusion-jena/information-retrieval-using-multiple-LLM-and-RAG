Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model's performance is evaluated by comparing the classified results with the actual land use/land cover (LULC) classes based on the CLC methodology. This is evident from Table 3, which provides the LULC classes and their respective codes and RGB colors. 

Moreover, the authors have mentioned that they have followed Congalton (1991) and Hay (1979), who suggest at least 50 pixels per thematic class for training. The authors have implemented an alternative strategy by including pure training areas that should contain at least 50 pixels in total and prominently represent the class of interest. This distribution was carried out through simplified random sampling (Chuvieco, 2020). This strategy might also serve as a method to monitor the model performance during training.

Furthermore, the authors have used various spectral indices such as NDVI, EVI, SAVI, BSI, MNDWI, and NDMI (as mentioned in Table 1) to extract relevant features from the datasets, which could be used to monitor the model performance during training.

However, the specific strategy or techniques used to monitor the model performance during training are not provided in the given context.
