Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text focuses on discussing the performance of various models such as ResNet50, MobileNet, VGG-19, EfficientNet, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2 in a specific classification task, along with details about their architecture and transfer learning technique. However, it does not mention where the code repository is located. I would recommend reaching out to the authors or the publication directly to inquire about the code repository.
