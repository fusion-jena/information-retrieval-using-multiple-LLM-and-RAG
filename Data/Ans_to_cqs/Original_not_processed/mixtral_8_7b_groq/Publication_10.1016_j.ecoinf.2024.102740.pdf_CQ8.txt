Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning pipeline or a code repository for it on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The context focuses on the use of Random Forest (RF) as a machine learning technique for geoscientific analysis, specifically for classifying and estimating forage quality of grasslands using remote sensing data. The RF model was implemented using the SAGA software (version 9.4.0) and the QGIS software, but there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the code repository as it was not mentioned in the context.
