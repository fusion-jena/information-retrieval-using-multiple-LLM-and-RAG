The provided context does not contain information about data bias techniques used during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide a general explanation of some common techniques used to address data bias:

1. **Stratified sampling**: This technique is used to ensure that the training and testing datasets are representative of the overall data distribution. In stratified sampling, the data is divided into subgroups or strata based on specific criteria (e.g., class labels), and then a balanced number of samples from each stratum are selected for the training and testing sets.
2. **Oversampling**: In oversampling, the minority class in the dataset is increased by replicating samples from that class. This technique helps to balance the dataset and prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class. However, oversampling can lead to overfitting if not done carefully.
3. **Undersampling**: Undersampling is the opposite of oversampling, where the majority class is reduced by removing samples from that class. This technique also helps balance the dataset, but it can result in loss of valuable information.
4. **Diverse data collection**: This technique involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is diverse and representative of the population. This can help reduce bias by ensuring that the model is exposed to a wide range of variations and patterns in the data.
5. **Data augmentation**: Data augmentation involves creating new synthetic samples by applying transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping) to the existing dataset. This technique can help increase the size of the dataset and reduce bias by exposing the model to different variations of the data.

It is important to note that the choice of technique depends on the specific dataset and the problem at hand. A combination of these techniques may also be used to address data bias effectively.
