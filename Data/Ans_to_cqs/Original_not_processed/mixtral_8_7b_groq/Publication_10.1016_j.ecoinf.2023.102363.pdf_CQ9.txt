Unfortunately, the provided context does not specify where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is available. Common data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, and GBIF are not mentioned. It is possible that the data repository is not publicly available or was not specified in the given text. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
