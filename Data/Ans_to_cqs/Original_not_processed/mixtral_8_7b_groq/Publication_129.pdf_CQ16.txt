Answer:
The criteria used to determine when training is complete for the insect pest classification system is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the system uses a Faster R-CNN for image-based classification, which typically involves training a deep neural network until certain performance metrics are achieved or a specified number of training epochs have been completed.

In the context, several performance metrics for the classification system are provided, including accuracy, precision, sensitivity or recall, and F1-score. These metrics are calculated based on the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions made by the system. It is possible that the training of the system is completed when a certain level of performance is achieved based on these metrics.

Additionally, it is mentioned that the system's performance was evaluated using four basic classification learning methods, but the specific criteria used for comparison are not provided.

In summary, while the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the insect pest classification system are not explicitly stated in the provided context, it is mentioned that several performance metrics are used to evaluate the system's performance, and it is possible that training is completed based on these metrics.
