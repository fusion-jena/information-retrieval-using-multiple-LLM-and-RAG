Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, there are some details about the dataset, model, and training procedure that can provide some insights.

Firstly, the authors used the COCO dataset, which is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. The COCO dataset contains 330,000 images and 1.5 million object instances, annotated with 80 object categories. This diverse and extensive dataset can help improve the generalizability of the model.

Secondly, the authors used a well-known deep learning model, Mask R-CNN, which is a state-of-the-art object detection and instance segmentation method. Mask R-CNN is built on Faster R-CNN, which is a region-based convolutional neural network (CNN) for object detection. Mask R-CNN extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. Mask R-CNN has been widely used and shown to be effective in various applications, which suggests its good generalizability.

Thirdly, the authors used a five-fold cross-validation strategy to evaluate the model's performance. Cross-validation is a commonly used technique for assessing the generalizability of a model by dividing the dataset into multiple folds and training and testing the model on different subsets of the data. This approach can help reduce overfitting and provide a more reliable estimate of the model's performance.

In summary, while there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, the use of a diverse dataset, a well-established model, and cross-validation suggests that the authors took some steps to improve the model's generalizability. However, without further information, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer to this query.
