Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the specific criteria used to split the data for training a deep learning model. The context focuses on the importance of selected factors, such as objects and text in the thumbnail information, number of uploaded videos, length of each video, and number of days since uploading, in relation to the number of views of videos featuring wild birds on YouTube.

The data extraction process for these videos is described, where the keyword "Yacho" was used on the official YouTube platform to search for videos of wild birds. Videos were sorted by the number of views and those with more than 100 views were extracted. However, there is no mention of how the data was split for training a deep learning model.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
