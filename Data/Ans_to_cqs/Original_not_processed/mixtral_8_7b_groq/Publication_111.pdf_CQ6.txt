Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are no specific preprocessing steps mentioned for the deep learning model (GRU-DNN) used in the study. However, it is mentioned that the training data is separated into training and validation groups to track the generalization performance. This is a common practice in machine learning to assess the model's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data.

The study focuses more on the optimization of the GRU-DNN model's hyperparameters, such as the number of previous observations (K) used in the training and forecasting task. A grid search method was used to obtain the optimal K value, which was found to be different for water temperature forecasting and significant wave height forecasting.

In general, preprocessing steps for deep learning models can include data cleaning, scaling, and normalization. Data cleaning involves removing or correcting erroneous or missing data. Scaling and normalization are used to transform the data to a common scale, which can help improve the model's performance and convergence during training. Common scaling techniques include min-max scaling, which scales the data to a range of [0, 1], and standardization, which scales the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Normalization techniques, such as L1 and L2 normalization, can also be used to transform the data.

Therefore, while the provided context does not mention specific preprocessing steps for the GRU-DNN model, it is still important to consider these steps when working with deep learning models to ensure the data is prepared properly for training.
