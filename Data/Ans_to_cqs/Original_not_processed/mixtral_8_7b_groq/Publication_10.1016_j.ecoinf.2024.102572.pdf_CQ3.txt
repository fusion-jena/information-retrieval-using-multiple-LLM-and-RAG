Based on the provided context, the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, we can infer that some form of image annotation was likely used to classify fire-damaged monuments in the study.

The context states that machine learning techniques were used to classify fire-damaged monuments, demonstrating notable success in identifying minor fires. It also mentions that researchers utilized a platform's advanced cloud computing capabilities to do extensive geospatial computations for quantifying carbon emissions from forest fires with intricate influencing factors.

Given that this study involved satellite imagery, it is reasonable to assume that image annotation techniques such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation were used to train the machine learning models. These techniques involve labeling or outlining specific objects or areas of interest in images, allowing the model to learn and recognize those features.

However, the specific data annotation techniques used in the study are not provided in the context. Therefore, we cannot give a definitive answer to this query without additional information.
