Answer:::

The specific deep learning framework used to build the model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the model was developed using a multi-branch CNN, which is a type of deep learning architecture.

In the references, there is a citation to TensorFlow, a popular open-source framework for building and deploying machine learning models (Abadi et al., 2015). It is possible that the authors used TensorFlow to build their deep learning model, but this is not explicitly stated in the context.

Therefore, while it is not possible to definitively answer this question without additional information, it is reasonable to infer that TensorFlow may have been used to build the deep learning model based on the reference in the text.
