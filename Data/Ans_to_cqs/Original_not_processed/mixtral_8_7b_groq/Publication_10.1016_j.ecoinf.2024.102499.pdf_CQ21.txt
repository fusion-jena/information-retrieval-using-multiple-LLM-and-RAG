The provided text discusses the training of a model for shark detection in underwater videos but does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps. However, based on common practices in machine learning, we can infer some possible postprocessing steps that might have been involved.

Answer:
After the model training, several postprocessing steps could have been applied. These steps might include:

1. **Saliency Maps**: Saliency maps can be used to visualize the areas of the image that the model is focusing on for its predictions. This can help in understanding if the model is focusing on the correct features for shark detection.

2. **Metrics Calculation**: Various metrics can be calculated to evaluate the performance of the model. These might include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. These metrics can provide a quantitative measure of how well the model is performing.

3. **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix can be created to further understand the performance of the model. This matrix can provide information on the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This can help in identifying any classes that the model is having trouble with.

4. **Model Optimization**: Based on the results of the above steps, the model might be optimized further. This could involve tuning hyperparameters, collecting more data, or trying different architectures.

However, the provided text does not mention any of these steps specifically, so it is possible that they were not performed.
