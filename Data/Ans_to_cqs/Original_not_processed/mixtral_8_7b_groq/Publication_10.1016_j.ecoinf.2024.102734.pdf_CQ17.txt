The provided context does not give specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe an active learning approach used for fine-tuning a model in a specific application.

To answer the query, I will provide a general explanation of common regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning:

Answer:::
Regularization methods are essential in deep learning pipelines to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Two common regularization techniques are L2 regularization and dropout.

L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is the sum of the squares of all model weights multiplied by a regularization factor. This penalty term discourages large weight values, leading to a simpler model that generalizes better.

Dropout is a technique that randomly sets a fraction of neuron outputs to zero during training, preventing the model from relying too much on specific connections. This leads to a more robust and generalized model.

In summary, L2 regularization and dropout are two common regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines.
