Answer:::

The generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through a specific data splitting approach and the use of pre-trained models. First, the annotated dataset, AnnotationsActions, was split randomly but fixed for all experiments and networks into a train set, validation set, and test set. The test set included 20% of the video clips of each class, and the validation set consisted of another 20% of the clips in each class. The remaining clips formed the training set. This splitting method aimed to maintain a balance of classes across the different sets.

Secondly, the models utilized in the study were pre-trained on large-scale datasets. The Mask R-CNN model was pre-trained on the COCO 2017train dataset, while the ResNets were pre-trained on the Kinetics-400 dataset. These pre-trained models were then fine-tuned on the specific action recognition task using the AnnotationsActions dataset. Leveraging pre-trained models that have been trained on diverse datasets can help improve the generalizability of the model by providing a good initialization and reducing overfitting.

However, the text does not explicitly mention techniques such as cross-validation or stratified splitting, which are also common methods to enhance model generalizability. Cross-validation involves dividing the data into multiple folds, training the model on different subsets, and averaging the performance metrics. Stratified splitting, on the other hand, ensures that the distribution of classes remains similar in each subset when splitting the data. Despite not being explicitly mentioned, the chosen methodology still provides a reasonable basis for ensuring the generalizability of the deep learning model.
