Answer:

The provided context does not give information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for bird species recognition. However, it does provide details about the feature extraction methods and classification models used in the study.

The feature extraction methods used include HHT (Hilbert-Huang Transform), STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform), WT (Wavelet Transform), Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), and a combination of these methods. These feature extraction methods are used to extract spectral features from bird songs, which are then used as input to the classification models.

The classification models used include a classic CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model and proposed models. The classic CNN model takes the features F1, F2, and F3 as input, and the proposed models take various combinations of features as input. The performance of these models is evaluated using test accuracy on a test set consisting of 3094 samples.

Therefore, while the context does not provide information about data annotation techniques, it does provide insights into the feature extraction and classification methods used in the deep learning pipeline for bird species recognition.
