Answer:::

The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using several metrics, including precision, recall, and accuracy. These metrics are calculated based on the number of true and false positive detections (NTP and NFP) and the number of true and false negative detections (NTN and NTP).

Precision (P) is the ratio of the number of true positive detections to the total number of positive detections (both true and false positives). It measures the proportion of correct positive detections out of all positive detections made by the model.

Recall (R) is the ratio of the number of true positive detections to the total number of actual positive instances (both true positives and false negatives). It measures the proportion of correctly detected positive instances out of all actual positive instances.

Accuracy (A) is the ratio of the total number of correct detections (both true positives and true negatives) to the total number of detections made by the model. It measures the overall performance of the model in correctly classifying both positive and negative instances.

In addition to these metrics, the F1 score is also used to evaluate the model's performance. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which takes into account both metrics to provide a balanced assessment of the model's performance.

These metrics are used to evaluate the model's performance for each experimental batch size and sound source, as shown in Table 3. The mean performance metrics for each batch size and sound source are reported, along with the standard error for the entire test set.
