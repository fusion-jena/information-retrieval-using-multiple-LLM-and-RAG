Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of various machine learning methods for predicting potential natural vegetation (PNV) in ecology and biogeography, but it does not specify the use of any particular frameworks for building deep learning models such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

The study by Hengl et al. (2018) evaluates different machine learning methods for PNV mapping, including neural networks, random forests, gradient boosting, and k-nearest neighbors. However, the study does not mention any specific deep learning frameworks used for building the neural network models.

In the study by BeigaitÄ— et al. (2022), the authors formulate a new computational setting for regression in the context of predicting global vegetation cover, where target labels are structurally incomplete. The study focuses on weakly supervised learning tasks and various terms used to describe them, but it does not discuss any specific deep learning frameworks.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding which frameworks are used to build deep learning models for predicting PNV or vegetation cover.
