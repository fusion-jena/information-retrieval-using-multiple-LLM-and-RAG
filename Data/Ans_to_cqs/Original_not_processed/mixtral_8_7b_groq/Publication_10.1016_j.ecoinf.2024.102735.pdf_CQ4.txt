Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling in the described deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the application of machine learning models for predicting chlorophyll-a levels in water quality datasets, including the use of random forest models with varying max_depth parameters. It also discusses the impact of measurement uncertainties on chlorophyll-a predictions and the importance of high-frequency datasets for improving prediction accuracy.

However, data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in image processing and computer vision tasks. These techniques can help increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, improving the model's ability to generalize and reducing overfitting.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques used in the described deep learning pipeline, such techniques are commonly employed in other applications to enhance model performance.
