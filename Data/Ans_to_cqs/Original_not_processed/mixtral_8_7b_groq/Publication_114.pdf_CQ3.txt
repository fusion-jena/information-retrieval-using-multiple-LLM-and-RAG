Answer:::

In the context provided, there is a specific example of data annotation used in a deep learning pipeline for remote sensing applications. Flood et al. [35] used a U-net convolutional neural network to extract woody vegetation extent from high-resolution three-band Earth-I imagery. For training the model, a selection of 1 km2 was manually labeled. However, the context does not explicitly mention the type of data annotation technique used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation.

From general knowledge of deep learning applications in computer vision, there are several data annotation techniques commonly used. Bounding box annotation involves drawing a box around the object of interest in an image. This technique is often used for object detection tasks where the goal is to locate the object within the image.

Instance segmentation, on the other hand, involves labeling each pixel of the object of interest in an image. This technique is more detailed and time-consuming than bounding box annotation, but it allows for more precise object localization and can be useful for tasks such as semantic segmentation or object counting.

In the context of remote sensing and tree species classification, data annotation techniques could include drawing polygons around individual trees or labeling each pixel of a tree canopy. The choice of data annotation technique would depend on the specific task and the level of detail required for accurate classification.

Overall, while the context provided does not explicitly mention the data annotation technique used in the deep learning pipeline for remote sensing applications, there are several commonly used techniques in deep learning applications that could be applied depending on the specific task and level of detail required.
