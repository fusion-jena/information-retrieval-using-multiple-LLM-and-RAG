Answer:::
The provided context does not contain specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that datasets can be in various file formats such as spreadsheet, video, and audio. It is also mentioned that datasets may have cited references or can be citable, but more commonly they inherit metadata of the overall study. This suggests that a wide range of data formats could be used in the deep learning pipeline, depending on the specific application and data sources. Ultimately, the choice of data format would depend on the nature of the data being used and the requirements of the deep learning algorithm.
