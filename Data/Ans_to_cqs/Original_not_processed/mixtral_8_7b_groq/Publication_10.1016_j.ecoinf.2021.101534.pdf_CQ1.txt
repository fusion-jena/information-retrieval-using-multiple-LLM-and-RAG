The text provides information on the use of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) as a method for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline, specifically in the context of analyzing sound sources in terrestrial and freshwater ecology.

Passive acoustic monitoring involves the use of sensors to record sounds in the environment. These sensors can be deployed in a variety of settings, such as forests, wetlands, and other habitats, to capture audio data. The sensors used in PAM can vary, but they typically consist of hydrophones for underwater recordings and microphones for terrestrial recordings.

The massive amount of data generated by PAM sensors can be analyzed using deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to automatically identify sound sources. However, the use of CNNs requires a large amount of training data, which can be a challenge in PAM applications.

To address this challenge, the text describes a method for converting mixed audio clips into spectrograms as input images for model training. This involves applying the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a window size of 1600 samples, hop size of 400 samples, and 240 mel-scale frequency bins. The resulting spectrograms have a height of 438 pixels and a width of 436 pixels.

The use of spectrograms as input images for CNN training can minimize the dilution effect and reduce the required amount of training data. This is because spectrograms provide a visual representation of the frequency content of audio signals over time, allowing CNNs to learn patterns and features that are specific to the sound sources of interest.

In summary, the raw data in the deep learning pipeline for PAM applications is collected using sensors that record sounds in the environment. The mixed audio clips are then converted into spectrograms as input images for CNN training, which can minimize the dilution effect and reduce the required amount of training data.
