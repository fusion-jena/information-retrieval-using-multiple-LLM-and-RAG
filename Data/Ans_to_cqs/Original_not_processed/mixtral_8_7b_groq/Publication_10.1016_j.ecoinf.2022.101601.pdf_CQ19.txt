Answer:::
The provided context does not include information about the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the model. The text focuses on the development of a Bayesian network (BN) model for predicting permafrost thaw depth, and discusses various aspects of this model such as input parameters, limitations, and comparison with other models. However, it does not mention any deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
