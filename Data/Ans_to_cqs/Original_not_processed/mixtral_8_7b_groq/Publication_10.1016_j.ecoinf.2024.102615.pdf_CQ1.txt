The provided context does not include specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of spectral reflectance data in the context of predicting total phosphorus concentration in rivers and mapping soil properties. Spectral reflectance data is often collected using sensors, specifically spectrometers, which measure the reflectance of light off of surfaces across the electromagnetic spectrum (Atkinson & Tatnall, 1997).

In the context of soil property mapping, spectral reflectance data can be collected using various sensors mounted on different platforms such as handheld devices, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or satellites (Xia & Zhang, 2022). For instance, Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and Gaofen-2 images are used for mapping soil pH in Dehui, northeastern China (Xia & Zhang, 2022). Similarly, in the context of predicting total phosphorus concentration in rivers, the raw spectral data could be collected using sensors mounted on boats or other watercraft.

Furthermore, the context also mentions the use of public datasets in the application of machine learning algorithms. These datasets could be collected through various methods, including surveys, sensors, or other data collection techniques. For example, the authors of "A review of deep learning techniques used in agriculture" (Attri et al., 2023) mention the use of public datasets for training deep learning models in agriculture.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that spectral reflectance data is often collected using sensors such as spectrometers. Additionally, public datasets may be used in the deep learning pipeline, which could be collected through various methods such as surveys, sensors, or other data collection techniques.
