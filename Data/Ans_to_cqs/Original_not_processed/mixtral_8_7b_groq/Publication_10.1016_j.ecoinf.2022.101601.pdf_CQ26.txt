The provided context does not directly discuss data bias techniques used during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention several studies related to permafrost models and their parameters. I will provide a general answer about data bias techniques that could be applicable to these studies or any other research that involves data preprocessing.

When dealing with data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed to address the issue:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific features or labels, ensuring a balanced representation in the training, validation, and test sets. Stratified splitting helps maintain the original distribution of the data and prevents bias in the learning process.

2. Oversampling: When a dataset is imbalanced, with one class having significantly more instances than another, oversampling can be used to increase the minority class's representation. This can be done by replicating instances from the minority class or using techniques like Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to generate new synthetic samples.

3. Undersampling: Alternatively, undersampling can be used to balance the dataset by reducing the number of instances in the majority class. This technique, however, may result in loss of information and should be used carefully.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources, perspectives, and conditions can help minimize data bias. By ensuring that the dataset is diverse and representative of the target population, the deep learning model is more likely to generalize well and perform accurately.

5. Data augmentation: This technique involves creating new instances by applying transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling, flipping) to the existing data. Data augmentation can help increase the size of the dataset, improve model robustness, and reduce overfitting.

6. Reweighting: In this approach, instances from the minority class are given higher weights during training, compensating for their underrepresentation in the dataset. Reweighting ensures that the model pays more attention to the minority class, reducing bias.

While the provided context does not discuss these techniques explicitly, they can be applied to various domains, including permafrost modeling, to ensure a fair and unbiased deep learning pipeline.
