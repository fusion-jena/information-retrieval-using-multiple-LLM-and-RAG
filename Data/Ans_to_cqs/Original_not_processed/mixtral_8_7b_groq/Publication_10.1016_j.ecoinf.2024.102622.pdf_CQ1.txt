Answer:::

The provided context discusses various sources of data used in remote sensing and image processing, particularly for agricultural applications. However, it does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. Nevertheless, I can infer that sensors and public datasets are commonly used for collecting raw data in this context.

Sensors refer to devices that capture data from the environment. In remote sensing, sensors are mounted on satellites, aircraft, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from a distance. For instance, the Sentinel-2 satellite is a sensor that provides multispectral images of the Earth's surface (Kˇríˇzov´a et al., 2022). Similarly, UAVs equipped with visible light cameras are used to capture images of vegetation in Karst areas (Yin et al., 2020).

Public datasets are another source of raw data in deep learning pipelines. These datasets are often created by aggregating data from various sources and made available for researchers to use. For example, the 10-m crop type maps in Northeast China during 2017-2019 are publicly available datasets used to train deep learning models for crop type classification (You et al., 2021).

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines, it can be inferred that sensors and public datasets are commonly used sources of data in this field.
