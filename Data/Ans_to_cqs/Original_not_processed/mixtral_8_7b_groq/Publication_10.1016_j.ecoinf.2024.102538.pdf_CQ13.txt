Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are as follows:

1. The number of epochs: The model was trained over 200 epochs.
2. Optimizer: The Adam optimizer was used.
3. Batch size: The batch size was fixed at 16.
4. Weight decay: A weight decay of 1 x 10 was used.
5. Learning rate: The initial learning rate was set at 0.001 and was subsequently reduced by a factor of 0.1 in a step-wise manner whenever the validation loss remained constant for five epochs. The minimum learning rate was not specified.
6. Hyper-parameter λ in Eq. (4): The value of λ was set to 0.8.
7. Hyper-parameter Mk in Eq. (5): Mk was defined as 2k+1, where k = 1, 2, ...K.
8. Hyper-parameter β in Eq. (6): The value of β was set to 0.4.

These hyperparameters were used to train a deep learning model for bird sound identification. The model consists of convolutional kernels and pooling layers, followed by a classification module that includes parallel K fully-connected layers followed by a softmax activation function. The primary objective is to learn the model parameters, namely θ = {θa, θb, θc}, through end-to-end training.

It is important to note that the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) such as the CRNN model requires more computing resources for training, and performance improvement is not always guaranteed. Another common approach to addressing the limitations of CNNs is to introduce attention mechanisms.

These hyperparameters were chosen to optimize the performance of the deep learning model for bird sound identification. The choice of hyperparameters can significantly impact the performance of the model, and selecting appropriate hyperparameters is crucial for achieving accurate and reliable results.
