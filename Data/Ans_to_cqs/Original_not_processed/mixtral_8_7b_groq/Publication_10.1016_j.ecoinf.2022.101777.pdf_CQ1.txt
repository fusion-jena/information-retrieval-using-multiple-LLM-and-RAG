The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of data from sensors related to water flow, specifically in the context of ecological informatics.

Answer:::
Based on the context, it can be inferred that sensors are used to collect data for the deep learning pipeline. The sensors are used to measure water flow in different events and seasons. For example, the context mentions "Direct Flow (m3/s)" and "Simula(cid:2)on (cid:2)me" which are likely measurements taken by sensors.

Answer:::
Furthermore, the context also mentions specific dates and Sentinel-2 satellite data (S2A\_MSI\_L1C and S2B\_MSI\_2A), which suggests that remote sensing data may also be used in addition to sensor data. Remote sensing data can be a valuable source of information for deep learning pipelines, especially in the field of ecological informatics.

Answer:::
However, it's important to note that the context does not explicitly state that surveys or public datasets are not used. It's possible that these methods were used in addition to or instead of sensor and remote sensing data.

Answer:::
In summary, based on the provided context, sensors and remote sensing data are likely used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, the context does not provide enough information to definitively say that surveys or public datasets are not used.
