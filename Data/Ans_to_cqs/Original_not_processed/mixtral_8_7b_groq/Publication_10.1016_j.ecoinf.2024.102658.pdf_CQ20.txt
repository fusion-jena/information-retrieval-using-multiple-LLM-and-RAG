Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text focuses on data collection, processing, and preprocessing, as well as the use of different climate datasets and feature sets for model training.

However, it can be inferred that given the complexity of deep learning models and the large amount of data used for training, it is highly likely that high-performance computing resources, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), were employed for training. These hardware resources can significantly speed up the training process due to their ability to perform parallel computations, which is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets and complex models.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, it is highly probable that GPUs or TPUs were utilized given the complexity of the models and the large datasets involved.

Answer::: The specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, considering the complexity of the models and the large datasets, it is highly likely that high-performance computing resources such as GPUs or TPUs were employed.
