Answer:::

The pieces of context provided do not specify the exact data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention the use of images in the context of fungal image analysis. Specifically, the methods described involve processing and analyzing sets of fungal images to identify and measure features such as hyphal length and branch points.

In Section 2.5.1, the authors describe computing precision, recall, F1-measure, and MMC for three different sets of fungal images. These images are likely in a format that can be processed and analyzed by the deep learning algorithms used in the study.

Additionally, in the approach proposed by Guo et al. (2021), spherical patches are extracted around points of interest in 3D volumetric images. This suggests that the input data for this deep learning pipeline includes 3D image data.

Therefore, while the specific data formats are not mentioned, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline described in the context involves processing and analyzing image data, specifically fungal images and potentially 3D image data. Other data formats such as audio or video are not mentioned in the provided context.
