The provided context discusses the pre-processing steps and experiments conducted for bioacoustic data, but it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing. However, it can be inferred that the authors took steps to address class imbalance in their data.

To create a balanced dataset, the authors applied a time-shift operation to generate synthetic spectrograms for the presence class, which was underrepresented. This technique is a form of oversampling, where the minority class is increased to match the size of the majority class. By doing so, they aimed to reduce the impact of class imbalance on the model's performance.

Additionally, the context implies that the datasets were randomly selected, but it does not mention whether stratified sampling was used during splitting. Stratified sampling ensures that the train and test sets maintain the original dataset's class distribution, which can help prevent bias in the preprocessing stage.

In summary, the context suggests that the authors used oversampling through time-shift operations and possibly stratified sampling to address data bias during preprocessing. However, it does not explicitly mention other techniques such as diverse data collection or undersampling.
