Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the models are optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. The focus of the provided information is on the comparison of the performance of different models and techniques for image classification tasks.

However, it is mentioned that the models are fine-tuned using raw and segmented images, which suggests that some hyperparameter tuning may have been performed during the fine-tuning process. Fine-tuning involves adjusting the pre-trained model's parameters to better fit the specific task and dataset, and hyperparameter tuning can be an important part of this process.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of the Adam optimizer, which is a popular optimization algorithm for deep learning models. However, the use of Adam does not necessarily imply a specific method for hyperparameter tuning.

Therefore, while some hyperparameter tuning may have been performed during the fine-tuning process, the specific method used for optimizing the hyperparameters is not provided in the given context.
