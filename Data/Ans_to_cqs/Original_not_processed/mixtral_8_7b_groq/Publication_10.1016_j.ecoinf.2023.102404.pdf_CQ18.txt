Answer:::
The strategy implemented to monitor the model's performance during training involves a systematic approach using cross-validation techniques and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric. In this process, a grid search method was adopted to optimize the parameters of the Random Forest (RF) model. The RF model's performance was evaluated for multiple combinations of parameters, including 'numberOfTrees', 'minLeafPopulation', 'bagFraction', and 'seed'.

The 'numberOfTrees' parameter, which represents the number of decision trees in the ensemble, was explored to determine the ideal number of trees that balances model complexity and predictive performance. Similarly, the 'minLeafPopulation' parameter, referring to the minimum number of samples required to form a leaf node in each tree, was experimented with to find the optimal setting that prevents overfitting while capturing meaningful patterns in the data.

The 'bagFraction' indicates the proportion of the training dataset used to train each individual tree. The search for the best value aimed to enhance model diversity and generalization. Lastly, the 'seed' parameter, a random number seed, was evaluated to ensure reproducibility and select the most stable and reliable results.

For each combination of these parameters, the model's performance was evaluated using cross-validation techniques, and the RMSE was calculated. The goal was to minimize the RMSE, which would result in the most accurate predictions. By employing the grid search method, the model's hyperparameters were optimized, enhancing its ability to generalize well to new, unseen data, making it a robust and effective tool for the regression task.

In summary, the strategy for monitoring the model's performance during training includes a comprehensive grid search for optimal parameters, cross-validation techniques, and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric. This systematic approach ensures that the RF model's hyperparameters are optimized, leading to accurate and reliable predictions for the regression task.
