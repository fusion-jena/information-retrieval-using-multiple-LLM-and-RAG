Answer: The dataset used in the deep learning pipeline for training the Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, and DenseNet-121 models is not explicitly named in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the models were trained on data consisting of 33,984 images taken during day and night with 6 animal classes. Therefore, it can be inferred that the dataset used is a wildlife camera trap dataset with 6 animal classes, and it was used for animal classification in the context of biodiversity monitoring and wildlife research.
