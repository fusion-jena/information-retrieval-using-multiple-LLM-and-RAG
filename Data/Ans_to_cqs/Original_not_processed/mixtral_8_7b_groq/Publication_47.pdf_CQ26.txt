Answer:::

The text provided discusses the development and implementation of a deep learning algorithm (IUC-NN) to predict the conservation status of orchid species using the IUCN Red List criteria. However, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.

From the context, it can be inferred that the dataset used for training and testing the IUC-NN model was randomly split. While random splitting is a common practice in machine learning, it may not be effective in addressing data bias, especially if the data is imbalanced or contains sampling bias.

To address data bias during preprocessing, several techniques can be employed, such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Stratified sampling involves dividing the data into subgroups or strata based on certain criteria, such as class labels or demographic features, and then randomly selecting samples from each stratum. This technique ensures that each subgroup is proportionally represented in the training and testing datasets, reducing bias and improving model performance.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance the class distribution in imbalanced datasets. Oversampling involves duplicating samples from the minority class, while undersampling involves removing samples from the majority class. These techniques can help reduce bias and improve model performance, but they may also lead to overfitting or underfitting.

Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population. This technique can help reduce bias and improve model performance by providing a more comprehensive view of the data.

In summary, while the text provided does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, several techniques can be employed, such as stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These techniques can help reduce bias and improve model performance by ensuring that the data is balanced, representative, and free from sampling bias.
