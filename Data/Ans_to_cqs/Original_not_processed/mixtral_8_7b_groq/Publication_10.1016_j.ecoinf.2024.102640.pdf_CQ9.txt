Answer:::
The provided context does not give information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of a specific deep learning model, SegFormer, for Green View Index (GVI) extraction, and the creation of a new dataset, UGE-D, for this purpose. However, it does not mention where the dataset or the trained models are available for access. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
