Answer:::

The code repository of the deep learning pipeline is not available on popular platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Instead, it is located on the ITINERIS Critical Zone Virtual Research Environment available on the D4Science e-Infrastructure. To access the repository, you need to register for free on the platform and the Virtual Research Environment.

The code repository contains all data, including ESRI-GRID raster files, tables, images, animations, and data-manipulation scripts. It is organized as a step-by-step process in subsequent folders and includes the list of species used to estimate species richness. The complete set of observation records is also available in the repository.

Additionally, the data and scripts are continuously updated on the ITINERIS Critical Zone Virtual Research Environment. The project code for ITINERIS is No. IR0000032 - ESFRI.
