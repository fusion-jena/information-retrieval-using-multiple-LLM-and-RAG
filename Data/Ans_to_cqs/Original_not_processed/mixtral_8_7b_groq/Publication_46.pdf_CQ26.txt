Answer:::

The provided context discusses various aspects of deep learning, particularly related to convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and their applications in remote sensing and species distribution modeling. However, it does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline.

Nevertheless, some techniques that are commonly used to address data bias in machine learning and deep learning include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain criteria (strata) and then ensuring that each stratum is proportionally represented in both the training and testing sets. This can help ensure that the model is exposed to the full range of data variability during training.

2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances from underrepresented classes in the dataset. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances from the majority class in the dataset. This can help prevent the model from being overwhelmed by the majority class and improve the model's performance on the minority class.

4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a wide range of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards a particular subset of the population.

While the provided context does not mention these techniques specifically in the context of addressing data bias during preprocessing, they are commonly used in deep learning and machine learning to ensure that the models are fair, accurate, and robust.
