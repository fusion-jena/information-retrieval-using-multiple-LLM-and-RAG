Based on the provided context, the specific metric used to evaluate the performance of the methods in classifying hidden observations is meanRSS (Root Sum of Squared Residuals). The context does not mention any other metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall that are commonly used in evaluating deep learning models.

The focus of the text is on comparing different methods for predicting intensity maps and their relative performance as measured by meanRSS. The authors note that some methods like LoopT and knn are competitive with the individual method, especially when a lasso penalty is used. They also emphasize that adding lasso regularization results in better performances, i.e., lower meanRSS, particularly for the badly performing methods when 80% of hidden observations are present.

The predicted intensity maps for the best-performing methods across the performance measures are shown in Figures 3 to 6, with 80% hidden observations and different combinations of lasso regularization and bias correction. The results for 20% and 50% hidden observations are presented in Appendix A.1.2.

In summary, while the context provides valuable information on comparing different methods for predicting intensity maps and their performance as measured by meanRSS, it does not mention any other metrics commonly used in evaluating deep learning models such as accuracy, precision, or recall.
