The provided pieces of context do not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention some methods related to data preprocessing and model evaluation.

In the context of soil moisture modeling, the authors extracted predictor values for the whole study area in a regular 10 Ã— 10 m square grid and used them for wall-to-wall prediction of volumetric water content (VWC) using a developed GAM model (Generalized Additive Model) (Larson et al., 2022). This process involves data preprocessing, but it does not specifically address data bias.

In the context of evaluating topographic wetness indices, Buchanan et al. (2014) used a method called Stratified sampling to ensure that their evaluation included a diverse set of landscape positions. Stratified sampling can help reduce bias by ensuring that different subgroups of the population are adequately represented in the sample. However, it does not directly address data bias during preprocessing.

The context also includes references to various machine learning and statistical learning techniques, such as the Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (Nordhausen, 2009), which discusses various methods for addressing data bias, including oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.

Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance classes in a dataset. Oversampling involves creating more instances of the minority class, while undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class. Both techniques can help reduce bias in a model by ensuring that all classes are adequately represented.

Diverse data collection involves gathering data from a variety of sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help reduce bias by ensuring that the dataset includes a variety of perspectives and experiences.

In conclusion, while the provided pieces of context do not directly discuss techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, they do mention some methods related to data preprocessing and model evaluation. Additionally, there are several techniques commonly used to address data bias during preprocessing, including oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
