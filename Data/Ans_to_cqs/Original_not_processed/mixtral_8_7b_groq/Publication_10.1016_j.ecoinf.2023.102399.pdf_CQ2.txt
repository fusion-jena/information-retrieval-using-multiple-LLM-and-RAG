Answer: The provided context does not discuss the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study focuses on fish biomass estimation using underwater stereo images. Therefore, it can be inferred that image data is used in this particular deep learning pipeline.

The abstract of the study mentions that the approach addresses challenges of preprocessing fish images, such as fish body occlusion, overlapping, conglutination, bending, and non-orthogonal imaging angles. This further supports the inference that image data is used in this study.

Additionally, the study by Jalal et al. (2020) mentioned in the context focuses on fish detection and species classification in underwater environments using deep learning with temporal information. This study also likely uses image data, as underwater video imagery is used to acquire the data.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly state the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that image data is used in the pipeline. Other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV may also be used, but this information is not provided in the context.
