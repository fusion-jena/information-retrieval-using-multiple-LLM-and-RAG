The provided context does not contain information about the specific type of deep learning model used in a pipeline. There are various types of deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers, among others. However, the context discusses the application of deep learning in ecology and mentions specific studies that use machine learning techniques for various ecological purposes, such as species distribution modeling, land use change characterization, and biodiversity conservation.

For instance, Christin et al. (2019) discuss the applications of deep learning in ecology but do not mention a specific deep learning model. Similarly, Cheng et al. (2018) use machine learning techniques to advance analytical methods and modeling tools in ecology but do not specify the type of deep learning model used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
