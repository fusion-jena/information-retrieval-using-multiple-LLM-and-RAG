Answer:::
The specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model in the study are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it does mention the configuration of the machine used for the experiments. According to Table 1, the machine used for training the models has a Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1 ~ 16.04.5 operating system, an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7700K CPU @ 4.20GHz for the central processing unit, 32G of memory, and a NVIDIA GeForce GTX TITAN Xp video card. Given that the study uses CUDA8.0 with cudnn, it can be inferred that the deep learning models were likely trained using the NVIDIA GPU, which is a common practice in deep learning training due to its high computational power and efficiency. However, the context does not provide information on whether other hardware resources, such as TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), were also used in the training process.
