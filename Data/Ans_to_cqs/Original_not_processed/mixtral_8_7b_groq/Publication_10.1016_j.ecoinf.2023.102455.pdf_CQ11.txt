Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct information given about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several research papers and a table with model performance metrics, but it does not mention any data repository link for the deep learning pipeline.

The first paper by Martinho et al., 2023, focuses on short-term prediction of natural daily streamflows using hybrid machine learning enhanced with grey wolf optimization. The second paper by Meng et al., 2022, proposes a novel wind power prediction approach using multivariate variational mode decomposition and multi-objective crisscross optimization based deep extreme learning machine. The third paper discusses the performance of hydrological models. However, none of these papers provide a link to the data repository of the deep learning pipeline.

The table with model performance metrics includes various models such as CNN-BiGRU, KELM, RVFL, CNN-BiRNN, and Phase. The metrics include R, RMSE, and MAPE for training and testing phases. But, this table is also not accompanied by any information about the data repository link.

Therefore, I am unable to provide the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
