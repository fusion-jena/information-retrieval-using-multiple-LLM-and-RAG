Unfortunately, the provided context does not specify the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes references to several articles and datasets, but it does not mention where the data repository is located. The datasets and articles referenced in the context are available through online databases such as DOI, arXiv, and Frontiers in Marine Science, but there is no information about a data repository on Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
