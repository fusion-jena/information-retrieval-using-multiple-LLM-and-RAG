Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the IP102 dataset in the context of comparing the performance of a ResNet-50 model with previous studies.

The IP102 dataset is likely a dataset used for image classification tasks, as ResNet-50 is a well-known CNN model for image recognition and classification. The dataset is likely to contain a large number of images, as the ResNet-50 model has been trained and evaluated on it.

Additionally, the context mentions that the ResNet-50 model was compared with previous studies, which suggests that the IP102 dataset may be a standard or commonly used dataset in the field of image recognition and classification.

Furthermore, the context also mentions other datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet in the context of deep learning, but it does not explicitly mention their use in the deep learning pipeline. MNIST is a dataset of handwritten digits, CIFAR is a dataset of natural images, and ImageNet is a large-scale dataset of images that has been widely used for object recognition tasks.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the IP102 dataset in the context of comparing the performance of a ResNet-50 model with previous studies. Additionally, it also mentions other datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet in the context of deep learning.
