Answer:::
Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context includes details about the use of the YOLOv3 algorithm for fish detection in underwater images, as well as information about the training dataset, hyperparameters, and data augmentation techniques used. However, it does not mention where the code for this pipeline is located. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
