Answer:::

The provided context discusses various studies related to air quality and deep learning models, but it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, based on general knowledge of data preprocessing techniques, I can provide some possible methods that could be used to address data bias.

Stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling are common techniques used to handle data bias during preprocessing. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to ensure that the training, validation, and testing sets have similar distributions. Oversampling is a technique used when the minority class is underrepresented in the dataset. It involves creating more instances of the minority class to balance the dataset. Undersampling, on the other hand, is used when the majority class is overrepresented. It involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class to balance the dataset.

Diverse data collection is another technique that can help address data bias. By collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population, data bias can be minimized. This technique can help ensure that the deep learning model is not biased towards a particular group or class.

In the context of air quality data, data bias can occur due to various factors such as geographical location, time of day, and weather conditions. To address data bias, researchers can use techniques such as stratified splitting to ensure that the training, validation, and testing sets have similar distributions of air quality parameters. They can also use oversampling or undersampling techniques to balance the dataset if certain air quality parameters are underrepresented or overrepresented. Additionally, collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of different geographical locations, time of day, and weather conditions can help minimize data bias.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, common techniques include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. These techniques can help ensure that the deep learning model is not biased towards a particular group or class and can improve the accuracy and generalizability of the model.
