Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the performance of the models was evaluated using precision, recall, and F-measure metrics, as reported in Tables 3, 4, and 5.

Moreover, the EfficientNet model was trained using the Adagrad optimizer for 100 epochs, and the dropout rate for each task was set at 0.5. The batch size was set at 20. These hyperparameters could have been tuned based on the performance of the model during training.

Furthermore, the authors used IoU (Intersection over Union) as the threshold for positives or negatives based on the object confidence scores estimated by the object detector. IoU was defined as the intersection over the union of the two bounding boxes, which were the ground-truth bounding box and the predicted bounding box. In this paper, the threshold of IoU was set at 0.3 to consider correct or incorrect detection results. This evaluation metric could have been used to monitor the model's performance during training.

Therefore, while the specific strategy for monitoring the model performance during training is not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that the authors used various evaluation metrics and hyperparameter tuning to ensure the model's performance.
