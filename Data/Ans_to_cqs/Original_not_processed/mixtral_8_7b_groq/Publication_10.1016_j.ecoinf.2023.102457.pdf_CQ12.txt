Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of the BirdNET model for extracting embeddings. BirdNET is a CNN trained specifically on audio data of bird vocalizations. The authors of the study expected higher performance of the embeddings from this model, as it had shown better classification accuracy compared to other models like VGGish and Wav2Vec 2.0. These other models are also CNNs, trained on vast YouTube audio and human speech audio datasets, respectively. The authors chose to use pre-trained CNNs, like BirdNET, due to the need for large datasets and high computational cost of training a model with gibbon vocalization data. However, they suggest that training a model with such data could result in even better performance for individual gibbon discrimination.
