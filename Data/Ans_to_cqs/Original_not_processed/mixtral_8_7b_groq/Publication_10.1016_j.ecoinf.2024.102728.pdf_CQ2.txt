Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline can utilize various data formats, including image, video, audio, and CSV files, depending on the specific application and task. The provided context shows examples of image and CSV data formats used in deep learning research.

In the Mohedano et al. (2017) study, the deep convolutional neural network is applied to object retrieval using image data. The authors use a dataset of images, and the deep learning model is trained to identify and locate specific objects within these images.

Petrovska et al. (2020) present a deep learning case study for aerial scene classification using remote sensing data. In this study, image data in the form of aerial photographs are used as input to the deep learning model for feature extraction and scene classification.

Furthermore, the Survey of Israel provides geospatial data in the form of maps and orthophotos, which can be used as image data in deep learning applications related to geographic information systems (GIS), land cover classification, or object detection in satellite or aerial imagery.

While the context does not explicitly mention audio or video data formats, deep learning models can also process these types of data. For instance, deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be used for audio signal processing, speech recognition, or video analysis tasks.

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) data format is another common input for deep learning models, especially for tasks involving structured data, such as regression, classification, or time series analysis. However, the provided context does not include examples of CSV data format usage in deep learning applications.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline can handle various data formats, including image, video, audio, and CSV. The provided context demonstrates the use of image data formats in object retrieval, aerial scene classification, and GIS applications. However, it does not explicitly mention audio or video data formats or CSV data format usage in deep learning applications.
