Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does mention that the proposed classification network demonstrates superior performance on a dataset, with improved classification accuracy for objects of different sizes compared to ResNet50 and ViT. The network incorporates Class Activation Mapping (CAM) to attend to important regions, which contributes to the increase in accuracy.

It can be inferred that the training process might include monitoring key performance metrics such as accuracy, loss, and convergence rate. Additionally, observing the class activation maps during training could provide insights into how well the model is focusing on relevant features for each object size. However, the context does not explicitly state the monitoring strategy.
