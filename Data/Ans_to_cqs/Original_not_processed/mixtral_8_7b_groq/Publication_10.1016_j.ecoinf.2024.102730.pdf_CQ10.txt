Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in any of the mentioned studies. The articles discuss the use of deep learning for various applications such as chimpanzee face recognition, plant species identification, and soil warming effects. However, they do not provide a link to the code repository.

For instance, Carvalho (2019) used deep learning for chimpanzee face recognition from videos in the wild, but the article does not mention the code repository. Similarly, Walker et al. (2023) used a hyperparameter-tuned batch-updated stochastic gradient descent for plant species identification, but the article does not provide a link to the code repository.

Furthermore, the article by Molnar et al. (2021) provides a comprehensive overview of machine learning models used for vegetation studies, but it does not mention any specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I would recommend checking the authors' affiliations and contacting them directly to request access to the code repository. Additionally, you may also look for the code repository on popular platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket by searching for the authors' names or the paper's title.
