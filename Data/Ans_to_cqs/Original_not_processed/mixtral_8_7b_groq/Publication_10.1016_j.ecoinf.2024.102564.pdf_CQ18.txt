Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit description of the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it is mentioned that three machine learning models, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forests (RF), were trained and tested using specific input and output variables related to the Atlantic Forest in Brazil.

For the ANN model, the trained architecture was a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with a hidden layer, and the number of neurons in this layer was determined using the Fletcher-Gloss method. The context also provides the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), correlation coefficient (r), and Bias for both the training and testing phases of each model. These metrics can be used to monitor the model performance during training.

In general, monitoring the model performance during training can be achieved by using various evaluation metrics, such as those provided in the context, and visualization techniques like learning curves, which plot the model performance as a function of the training set size. Additionally, techniques like cross-validation, early stopping, and regularization can be employed to prevent overfitting and ensure the model's generalization ability. However, without specific information in the context, it is not possible to determine the exact strategy used to monitor the model performance during training.
