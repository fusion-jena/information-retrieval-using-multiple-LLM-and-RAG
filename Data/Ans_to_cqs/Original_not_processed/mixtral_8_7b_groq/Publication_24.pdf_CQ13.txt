Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific details about the values of the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the model used is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and was implemented using Theano and Lasagne libraries in Python.

CNNs typically have hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of layers, number of neurons in each layer, optimizer, activation function, batch size, and number of epochs.

The learning rate determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function. The optimizer is a method used to minimize the loss function, such as stochastic gradient descent or Adam. The number of layers and neurons in each layer determine the complexity of the model. The activation function is used to introduce non-linearity in the model. Batch size is the number of samples used in one iteration, and the number of epochs is the number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset.

The context mentions that different normalization strategies were applied before inputting the data into the network. However, it does not provide information about how these strategies affected the hyperparameters.

Therefore, while the context provides information about the type of model used and the libraries used for implementation, it does not give specific details about the values of the hyperparameters used in the model.
