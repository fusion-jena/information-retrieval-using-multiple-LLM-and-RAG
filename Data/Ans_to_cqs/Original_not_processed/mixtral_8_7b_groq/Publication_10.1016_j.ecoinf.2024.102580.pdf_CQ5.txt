Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline described in the study are not specifically mentioned as one of the standard datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the study utilizes a 2012 aerial imagery dataset specific to their research. This dataset is part of the ground-truth imagery used for training and validating the deep learning models in the study. The aerial imagery dataset, along with the deep learning and post-processing scripts, can be found in the open-access repository at https://git.wur.nl/deep-learning-tools-for-marine-ecosystem-monitoring. This allows other researchers to adapt the scripts to various ecosystems, including challenging coastal environments.
