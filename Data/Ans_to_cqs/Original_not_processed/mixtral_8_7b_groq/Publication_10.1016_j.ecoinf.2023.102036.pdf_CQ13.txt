Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include the learning rate, momentum, standard deviation threshold, and input size. The optimized values for these hyperparameters are as follows: the learning rate is 0.096, momentum is 0.845, standard deviation threshold is 0.05, and input size is (200, 250, 3).

The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls how much to change the model in response to the estimated error each time the model weights are updated. Momentum is another hyperparameter that helps the model to overcome local minima by continuing to move in the direction of the previous weight change. The standard deviation threshold is used to determine the similarity or dissimilarity of photos in a batch. Lastly, the input size is the dimension of the input images to the model.

It is worth noting that each optimization run consisted of 3000 training iterations with a batch size of 25 individuals, and the selected parameters correspond to the run shown in Supplementary Fig. S3. The performance of the runs was studied using TensorBoard, a set of visualization tools included in the open-source library TensorFlow.

In summary, the deep learning model used in the study employed several hyperparameters, including the learning rate, momentum, standard deviation threshold, and input size, to optimize the model's performance. These hyperparameters were carefully selected based on the optimization runs and the study's objectives.
