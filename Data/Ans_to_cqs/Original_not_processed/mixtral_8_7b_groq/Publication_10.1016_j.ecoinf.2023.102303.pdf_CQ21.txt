Answer:::
Based on the provided context, there are no specific details mentioned about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, we can infer some possible postprocessing steps that could have been used, given the common practices in machine learning and the specific details provided about the model.

Firstly, after the model training, it is common to evaluate the model's performance using various metrics. In the context, the model's performance is reported to be 94% accuracy, but there is no mention of other metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, etc. Therefore, calculating these metrics could have been one of the postprocessing steps.

Secondly, the model is a deep learning model based on ResNet and contrastive learning, and it is used for binary fish/no-fish classification. Therefore, generating a confusion matrix could have been another postprocessing step to evaluate the model's performance in terms of false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives.

Thirdly, the model is fine-tuned using a small subset of weakly labeled data in the second phase of training. Therefore, generating saliency maps could have been a postprocessing step to visualize the model's attention and understand how it makes its predictions. Saliency maps can highlight the important regions in the input images that contribute to the model's decision-making process.

Finally, the model is implemented using the Keras APIs under the TensorFlow framework, and the training involves several data augmentation techniques such as random horizontal flipping, random ±7o rotation, and random ±40% brightness. Therefore, applying the same data augmentation techniques during the inference time could be another postprocessing step to increase the model's robustness and generalization.

In summary, although there are no specific details provided about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, we can infer some possible steps such as calculating metrics, generating a confusion matrix, generating saliency maps, and applying data augmentation techniques during the inference time.
