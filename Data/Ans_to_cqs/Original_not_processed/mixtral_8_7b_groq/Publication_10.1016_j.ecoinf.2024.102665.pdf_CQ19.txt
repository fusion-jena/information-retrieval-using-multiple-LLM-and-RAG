Based on the provided context, there is no information about the use of deep learning models in the described study. The focus of the study is on the use of a network structure for supervised learning of the fish factor (FF) using measured variables as predictors. The network comprises manifest variables from corals, sponges, and gorgonians. The study uses the MWST-learned network for the final clustering of each group of variables and creates a hierarchical clustering network that summarizes information on the coral reef community from the measured variables across taxa.

The study does mention the use of an optimization algorithm in the context of detecting the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming. However, it does not specify the use of any deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.

Therefore,

Answer:::
The provided context does not contain information about the use of deep learning models or any specific deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
