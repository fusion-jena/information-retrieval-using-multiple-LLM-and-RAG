Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information on how the hyperparameters of the UMAP model were optimized. The text only mentions that further analysis should provide information on how hyperparameter calibration affects the performance of UMAP. It is also noted that UMAP is a stochastic method, and an assessment of how randomness affects the results could be undertaken to obtain an estimate of variability. However, there is no mention of any methods used for hyperparameter optimization such as grid search or random search. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer this question.
