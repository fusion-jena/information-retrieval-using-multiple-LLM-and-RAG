Answer:::
The provided context discusses the architecture and performance of a deep learning model called SeedNet, which is used for single seed classification and retrieval. However, it does not give specific details about the hyperparameters used in the model, such as the learning rate or optimizer.

SeedNet is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that contains six learnable layers, five of which are convolutional layers and the last one is fully-connected. The ReLU activation function is applied to the output of every convolutional layer, and a Max pooling strategy with a 3 × 3 filter size and 1 × 1 stride is employed between successive convolutional layers. The input image size is 224 × 224 × 3, and the output of the last fully-connected layer is fed to a N-way softmax, which produces a distribution over the N class labels to predict.

The context also mentions that the similarity measure used for the retrieval task performed with deep features is the Euclidean distance. However, it does not provide information about other hyperparameters such as learning rate, optimizer, batch size, number of epochs, etc.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model.
