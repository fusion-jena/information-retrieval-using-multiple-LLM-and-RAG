Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are several postprocessing steps that can be inferred to be involved after model training, such as the calculation of various metrics, creating violin plots for visualization, and computing variable importance. However, there is no explicit mention of techniques like saliency maps or confusion matrices.

Firstly, the metrics calculated include the coefficient of determination (R2), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), relative Root Mean Square Error (rRMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the models.

Secondly, violin plots are used for visualizing the distribution of canopy cover. These plots provide a comprehensive view of the data, including the quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3) and the minimum and maximum canopy cover. This helps in understanding the distribution of the observed and predicted canopy cover.

Thirdly, variable importance is calculated for the machine learning models. This is crucial as these models, especially Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Light Gradient Boosting Machine, are prone to overfitting. Therefore, it is essential to address this issue by tuning the hyperparameters. The variables considered for importance are GARI, GI, GNDVI, GREEN, MSR, NDVI, RDVI, RED, SI2, and VARIg.

However, there is no mention of techniques like saliency maps or confusion matrices in the provided context. Saliency maps are often used in image classification tasks to highlight the important regions in the input image that influenced the model's prediction. On the other hand, a confusion matrix is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm in terms of correct and incorrect predictions.

In conclusion, the postprocessing steps involved after model training, as per the provided context, include the calculation of metrics (R2, RMSE, rRMSE, MAE), creating violin plots for visualization, and computing variable importance. There is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrices.
