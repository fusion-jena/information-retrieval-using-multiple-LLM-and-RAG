Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, as described in the provided context, involves dividing the herbarium specimen data into training and test sets. 

For the Herbarium255 dataset, which consists of 255 species from Costa Rica, the data is split into 70% training data and 30% test data. The training set is used to train the model, while the test set is used to compute the top-1 and top-5 classification accuracy.

Similarly, for the Herbarium1K dataset, which consists of 1K species from France, the data is split into 80% training data and 20% test data. This separation is done by species, and within each species, a certain percentage of the data is allocated to the training and test sets.

In addition to the train and test sets, the context also mentions the use of a generalist dataset, ImageNet, for pre-training the neural network. This pre-training step is done to initialize the weights of the network before fine-tuning it on the herbarium specimen data.

Therefore, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training in this context involves dividing the herbarium specimen data into training and test sets, and pre-training the network on a generalist dataset.
