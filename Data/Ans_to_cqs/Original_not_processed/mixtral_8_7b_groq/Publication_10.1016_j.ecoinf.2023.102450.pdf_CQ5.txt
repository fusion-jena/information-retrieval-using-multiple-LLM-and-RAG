Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly name the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does describe a specific dataset created and used for a study on ecological informatics.

The dataset, created by Yin et al., consists of three classes of videos and images: circular curve, straight line, and 8-shaped curve. There are 10 videos in the circular curve class with a total duration of 927 seconds and 27,819 images. The straight line class contains 22 videos with a total duration of 1374 seconds and 41,225 images. Lastly, the 8-shaped curve class has 10 videos with a total duration of 678 seconds and 20,340 images. The purpose of this dataset is to train and test a deep learning model for animal tracking.

As for the other sources mentioned in the context, they do not provide information about the datasets used in their deep learning pipelines. Clune (2018) uses camera-trap images for deep learning-based wild animal identification, but the specific dataset is not named. Okafor et al. (2016) compare deep learning and bag of visual words for wild-animal recognition, but again, the dataset remains unnamed. Schindler and Steinhage (2021) mention the Siamese relation network, which uses a ResNet-50 backbone for feature extraction and a cascade structure of a region-based convolutional neural network for classification, but there is no information about the dataset used for training and testing.

In summary, the provided context mainly focuses on a specific dataset created by Yin et al. (2024) for animal tracking. The other sources do not offer information on the datasets used in their deep learning pipelines.
