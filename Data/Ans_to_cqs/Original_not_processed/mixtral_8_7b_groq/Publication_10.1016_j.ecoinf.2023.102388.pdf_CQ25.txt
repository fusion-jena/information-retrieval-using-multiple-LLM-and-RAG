Answer:::
The purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, we can infer that it is used for image-based discrimination of marine mammals, specifically belugas, based on the following details:

1. The models are trained on a dataset of beluga images, suggesting an image classification or discrimination task (Villon et al., 2022).
2. The use of batch-norm, dropout, and weight decay in the 'no-overfitting' setting indicates that the models are likely trained to classify or discriminate between different belugas (individual identification) rather than detecting or segmenting specific features within the images.
3. The normalization of distance scores and the use of a contrastive loss function further support the idea of a discrimination or classification task, as these techniques aim to minimize the distance between similar images (of the same beluga) and maximize the distance between dissimilar images (of different belugas).
4. The choice of target models, ResNet50 and DenseNet121, are popular architectures for image classification tasks, providing further evidence that the deep learning model is used for beluga discrimination or classification.

In summary, based on the provided context, the purpose of the deep learning model is likely to classify or discriminate between individual belugas using image-based data.
