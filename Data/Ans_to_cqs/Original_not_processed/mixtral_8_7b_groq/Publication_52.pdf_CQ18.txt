Answer:

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about a specific strategy that is implemented to monitor the model performance during the training of Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs). However, it is mentioned that ELMs have the potential to generalize based on their training data set, and they can determine the appropriate output weights towards the most effective resolution of a problem. Moreover, ELMs do not require fine manipulations to determine their operating parameters, and they can handle non-differential activation equations.

ELMs use the SLFFNN's general methodology, where the hidden layer parameters are independent of the activation functions and the training data. The hidden layer parameters can be randomly created before seeing the training data. A mathematical basis has been provided for the understanding of ELMs, and a specific type of ELM, called Online Sequential ELM (OSELM), is an alternative technique for large scale computing and machine learning when data becomes available in a sequential manner.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention a specific strategy for monitoring ELM performance during training, it is mentioned that ELMs have the potential to generalize, do not require fine manipulations to determine operating parameters, and can handle non-differential activation equations. Additionally, OSELM is an alternative technique for large scale computing and machine learning when data becomes available in a sequential manner.
