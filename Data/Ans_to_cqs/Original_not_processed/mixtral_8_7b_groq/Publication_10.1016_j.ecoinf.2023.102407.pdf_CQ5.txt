Answer:::

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Instead, it discusses the use of climate data for machine learning applications.

The context refers to a set of BIOCLIM variables, which are climate data layers used to describe climate surfaces for species distribution modeling. These variables include mean temperature of the wettest quarter, mean temperature of the driest quarter, mean temperature of the warmest quarter, mean temperature of the coldest quarter, annual precipitation, precipitation of the wettest month, precipitation of the driest month, precipitation seasonality, precipitation of the wettest quarter, precipitation of the driest quarter, precipitation of the warmest quarter, and precipitation of the coldest quarter. These variables are continuous and are used for data augmentation in a machine learning pipeline.

The context also mentions the use of scikit-learn, a machine learning library for Python, and Maxent, a machine learning method for species distribution modeling. However, it does not provide information on any specific datasets used in the pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query about the datasets used in deep learning pipelines.
