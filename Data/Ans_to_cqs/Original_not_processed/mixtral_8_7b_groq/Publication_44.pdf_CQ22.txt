Answer:::
The text provided gives information on several metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models in the context of herbarium sheet image analysis. However, it does not explicitly mention standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall.

The metrics mentioned in the text are:

1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): This is the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values. A lower MAE indicates better performance.

2. Mean Squared Error (MSE): This is the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. A lower MSE indicates better performance.

3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): This is the square root of the mean of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. A lower RMSE indicates better performance.

4. Other metrics mentioned are related to the specific task of object detection and segmentation in herbarium sheet images. These include:
   - Filled area: The area of the object filled by pixels.
   - Major/minor axis length: The length of the major and minor axes of the object's bounding box.
   - Perimeter: The length of the boundary of the object.
   - Solidity: The ratio of the object's area to the area of its convex hull.
   - Diameter: The diameter of the object.
   - Aspect ratio: The ratio of the major axis length to the minor axis length.
   - Rectangularity: The ratio of the object's area to the area of a rectangle with the same perimeter.
   - Compactness: The ratio of the square of the perimeter to the area of the object.
   - Circularity: A measure of how closely the object's shape resembles a circle.
   - Narrow factor: A measure of the object's narrowness.
   - Perimeter-diameter ratio: The ratio of the perimeter to the diameter.
   - Perimeter-length ratio: The ratio of the perimeter to the length of the major axis.
   - Width-ratio: The ratio of the major axis length to the width of the bounding box.

The text provides information on several metrics used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models in the context of herbarium sheet image analysis. While it does not explicitly mention standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall, it does mention Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These are all measures of the difference between predicted and actual values, with lower values indicating better performance.

In addition to these general metrics, the text mentions several metrics specific to the task of object detection and segmentation in herbarium sheet images. These include filled area, major/minor axis length, perimeter, solidity, diameter, aspect ratio, rectangularity, compactness, circularity, narrow factor, perimeter-diameter ratio, perimeter-length ratio, and width-ratio. These metrics provide information on the size, shape, and boundary of the detected objects, allowing for a detailed evaluation of the model's performance.

The text also mentions that the deep learning models were trained using an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1 × 10−4 and a binary cross-entropy loss function, as the task was a binary class problem (leaf or background). The models were trained for 100 epochs with a batch size of 3.

Overall, while the text does not explicitly mention accuracy, precision, or recall, it provides a detailed overview of the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in the context of herbarium sheet image analysis. These metrics allow for a thorough evaluation of the models' ability to detect and segment objects in the images, providing valuable insights into the models' performance.
