Based on the provided context, the specific purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated. However, we can infer that it is likely used for image classification or segmentation in the context of remote sensing and GIS applications.

In Congedo (2021), the Semi-automatic Classification Plugin (SCP) is presented as a Python tool for the download and processing of remote sensing images in QGIS. The SCP utilizes machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models, for image classification. Therefore, it is likely that the deep learning model in this context is used for image classification.

In Daryaei et al. (2020), the authors use Sentinel-2 data for fine-scale detection of vegetation in semi-arid mountainous areas. They combine Sentinel-2 data with UAV data and use a deep learning model for object detection. Therefore, in this context, the deep learning model is used for object detection.

In the broader context of remote sensing and GIS applications, deep learning models are often used for image classification, segmentation, and object detection. Image classification involves assigning a label to each pixel in an image based on its spectral characteristics. Segmentation involves dividing an image into regions or segments based on similarities in spectral, textural, or spatial characteristics. Object detection involves identifying and locating objects within an image.

Deep learning models have shown promising results in remote sensing applications due to their ability to learn complex patterns and relationships in large datasets. They have been used for various applications, including land cover classification, land use classification, object detection, and change detection.

Therefore, while the specific purpose of the deep learning model is not explicitly stated in the provided context, it is likely used for image classification or segmentation in the context of remote sensing and GIS applications.
