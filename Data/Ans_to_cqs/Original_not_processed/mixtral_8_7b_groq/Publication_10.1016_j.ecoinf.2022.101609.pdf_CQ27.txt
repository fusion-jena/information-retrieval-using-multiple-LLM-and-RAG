Based on the provided context, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model likely included model serialization and platform selection.

Firstly, the deep learning model was trained to make day-ahead predictions of three pollutants. The model was evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error/root mean squared error (MSE/RMSE) and mean absolute error, which are commonly used for regression problems. The training and validation losses of the model were plotted against the number of epochs, and it was observed that there was a gradual decrease in both losses as the training epochs increased, indicating that the model was learning.

Once the model was trained and evaluated, it was likely serialized to make it easier to deploy. Model serialization involves converting the model into a format that can be easily stored and loaded, such as a .h5 file in the case of Keras models. Serializing the model allows it to be easily deployed to a variety of platforms.

After serialization, a platform was selected for deploying the model. The context does not provide specific details about the platform selection process, but it does mention that the proposed deep learning framework for highway AQ monitoring and prediction is composed of four layers, including a hardware layer and an analytics layer.

The hardware layer consists of two Oracle Cloud instances with different specifications, which were used to test the scalability of the REVIS system. One instance was a Bare Metal Compute - Ampere A1 - OCPU instance with 32GB of CPU memory and no GPU, while the other instance was a VM.Standard.E4 instance with a Pascal GPU and 12 CPU cores, 72GB of CPU memory, and 16GB of GPU memory. It is possible that the trained deep learning model was deployed to one or both of these instances.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model likely included model serialization and platform selection, with the model potentially being deployed to one of the Oracle Cloud instances mentioned in the context. However, specific details about the platform selection process are not provided in the context.
