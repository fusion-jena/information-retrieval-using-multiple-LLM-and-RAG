The provided context does not directly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss a case study where functional data analysis is applied to a multifrequency acoustics dataset acquired from scientific echosounders in the West African water. This dataset is used to explore the spatial arrangement of marine organism aggregations and their attributes, such as thickness, relative density, and depth, in relation to their surroundings.

The environmental conditions are represented at a fine scale using a towed multiparameter system. Although the context does not explicitly state the data format, it can be inferred that the data is likely in a structured format, such as a time series or a matrix, where each column might represent a different variable (e.g., sea temperature, fluorescence, turbidity, and salinity) and each row might represent a measurement at a specific time or location.

Additionally, the study uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Classification Analysis (CAH) for dimension reduction and clustering, respectively. These techniques are typically applied to numerical data, suggesting that the data is likely quantitative and not in an image, audio, or video format.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in this specific study likely uses structured numerical data, such as a time series or matrix, rather than image, audio, or video data.
