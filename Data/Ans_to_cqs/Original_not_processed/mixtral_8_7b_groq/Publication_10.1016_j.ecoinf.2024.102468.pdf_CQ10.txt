Answer:::

I'm sorry, but the provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository link. The context includes several papers and a book, but none of them mention a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket link for a deep learning pipeline.

The first piece of context is a paper titled "Ecological Informatics80(2024)10246811" by O.P. Babalola and J. Versfeld, which discusses the use of a WT-HMM (Wavelet Transform Hidden Markov Model) for detecting a specific signal in a varying dataset size. However, it does not mention a deep learning pipeline or its code repository.

The second piece of context is a paper titled "Feature Extraction Methods for the Detection of North Atlantic Right Whale Up-Calls" by Ibrahim et al., which discusses various feature extraction methods for detecting whale calls. Again, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or its code repository.

The third piece of context is a paper titled "Birdnet: a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring" by Kahl et al., which discusses a deep learning solution for bird species identification. However, the paper does not provide a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.

The fourth piece of context is a book titled "A Friendly Guide to Wavelets" by Kaiser and Hudgins, which provides an introduction to wavelets and their applications. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or its code repository.

The fifth piece of context is a paper titled "What is a complex system?" by Ladyman et al., which discusses the concept of complex systems. There is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or its code repository.

Therefore, I cannot provide the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
