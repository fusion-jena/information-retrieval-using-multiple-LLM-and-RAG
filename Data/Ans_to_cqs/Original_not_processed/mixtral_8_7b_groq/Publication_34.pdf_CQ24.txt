Answer:::

The text provided does not explicitly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does describe several instances of random selection of species subsets, which implies some level of randomness in the data preprocessing stage.

First, a subset of 1000 species (E1000) is randomly selected from an initial set of 7626 species. Then, 200 species are randomly chosen from E1000 to form E200, and finally, 50 species are randomly selected from E200 to create E50, which is the main dataset used for comparison with baseline models.

However, the text does not mention any specific strategies to ensure reproducibility of the results, such as fixing a random seed value for the random selection processes or other aspects of the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, while the text describes instances of randomness in the data preprocessing stage, it does not provide clear information on strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
