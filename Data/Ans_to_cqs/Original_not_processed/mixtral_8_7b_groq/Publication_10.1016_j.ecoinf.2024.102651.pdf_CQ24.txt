The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of specific network architectures and techniques that can contribute to the consistency and reliability of deep learning models.

One such architecture is ResNet, which includes a residual structure that connects different network layers via shortcut connections. This structure helps to preserve input features and mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients, which can be caused by randomness in the training process. By addressing these issues, the residual structure can improve the classification effect of the network and contribute to more consistent performance.

Another architecture mentioned in the context is the CA-Hybrid network, which is constructed for Cervidae classification based on ResNet and ViT. The integration of CAM (Class Activation Mapping) into the residual structure of ResNet can help to better classify objects by highlighting the important features of the input image. This technique can also contribute to more consistent performance by reducing the impact of randomness on the classification process.

In addition to these architectures, the use of pre-trained models and transfer learning can also help to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Pre-trained models are trained on large datasets and can provide a good starting point for training a model on a smaller dataset. Transfer learning involves using a pre-trained model as a starting point and fine-tuning it on a new dataset. These techniques can help to reduce the impact of randomness on the training process by providing a more reliable starting point for training.

Overall, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention several techniques and architectures that can contribute to more consistent and reliable performance. These include the use of ResNet with its residual structure, the integration of CAM into ResNet, and the use of pre-trained models and transfer learning.
