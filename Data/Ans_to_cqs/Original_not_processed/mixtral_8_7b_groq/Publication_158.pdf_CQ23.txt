Based on the provided context, several measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. First, the ensemble approach was used to improve the model's performance and reduce variability. An ensemble of three models was generated, and the average of the final output layer was taken. This method helps to reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Second, data augmentation was applied to enhance sample variation and increase the size of the training dataset. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation, reflectance bias of ±10%, and random noise of ±10% reflectance for 15% of the input image were used. These techniques help to increase the diversity of the training data and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Third, the Adam optimizer was used with 500 epochs and categorical-cross entropy loss function. The batch size was set to 64. These settings help to ensure that the model is trained sufficiently and can converge to an optimal solution.

Fourth, early stopping criteria were applied if no improvement was found in 50 epochs. This technique helps to prevent overfitting and ensures that the model does not continue to train on data that it has already seen.

Finally, the network weights with the best performance were kept by monitoring the validation data across training epochs. This method helps to ensure that the model's performance is evaluated on unseen data and that the model is not overfitting to the training data.

Overall, the ensemble approach, data augmentation, appropriate optimization settings, early stopping criteria, and monitoring of validation data across training epochs were used to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
