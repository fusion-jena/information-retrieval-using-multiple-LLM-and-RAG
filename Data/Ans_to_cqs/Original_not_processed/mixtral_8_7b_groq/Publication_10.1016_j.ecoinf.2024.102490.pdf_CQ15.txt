Answer:::

The provided context does not specifically mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of XGBOOST, which is an implementation of gradient boosting machines (GBMs) and not directly related to deep learning.

In the context of deep learning, some commonly used optimization techniques include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple optimization algorithm used in machine learning and deep learning. It updates the parameters of the model by computing the gradient of the loss function with respect to each parameter and then adjusting the parameter in the opposite direction of the gradient.

Adam is an optimization algorithm that combines the ideas of momentum and adaptive learning rates. It keeps an exponentially decaying average of past gradients and squared past gradients, and uses these averages to update the parameters of the model.

RMSprop is another optimization algorithm that also uses an adaptive learning rate. It keeps a moving average of the squared gradients and uses this average to scale the learning rate.

Adagrad is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the historical gradient information. It keeps a running average of the squared gradients for each parameter and uses this average to scale the learning rate.

Therefore, while the provided context does not specifically mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that one of these techniques was used.
