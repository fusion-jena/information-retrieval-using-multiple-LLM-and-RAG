Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves the use of class weights to give more importance to the minority classes. This is done in two steps. First, the function called 'compute\_class\_weights' from the sklearn library in Python is used to calculate the weights for each class based on the class numbers. Then, these class weights are used as inputs to train the model by setting the class weight parameters using the previously calculated weights. The fit function inside sklearn applies these parameters during training. This strategy ensures that the model pays more attention to the minority classes, which might otherwise be overlooked during training.

Additionally, the model's performance is also measured using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Accuracy measures the overall percentage of correct predictions, while precision measures the number of positive predictions that are actually correct. Recall, on the other hand, measures the number of positive predictions that are actually correct out of all positive predictions made by the model. These metrics provide a more comprehensive view of the model's performance, as accuracy alone might not be sufficient to evaluate the model's efficiency.

For instance, for the EfficientNetB3 model, the recall for class 19 is 0.9979, indicating that the model correctly spotted 99.79% of the positive predictions for class 19. This is a significant improvement compared to the confusion matrix of the model, which shows that the model misclassified class 19 with class 22 23 times. With ensemble modeling, this classification error is removed, further improving the model's performance.

Therefore, by implementing class weights and monitoring the model's performance using various metrics, the model's training process is effectively monitored, ensuring that the model pays more attention to the minority classes and providing a comprehensive view of the model's performance.
