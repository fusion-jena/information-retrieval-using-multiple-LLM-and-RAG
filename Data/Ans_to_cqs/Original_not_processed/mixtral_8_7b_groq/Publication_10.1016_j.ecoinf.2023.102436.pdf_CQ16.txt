Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, the text does discuss the use of a restorative potential model in the context of urban planning and design.

The model for restorative potential is given by equation (1) and (2) in the text, which takes into account various metrics related to the urban landscape, such as tree cover, building density, and water features. Each metric is normalized and assigned a weight, and the final score is calculated as the sum of the weighted metrics.

To estimate the restorative potential for the entire terrain area, a statistical gap-filling technique is used, specifically the interpolative shading approach within MATLAB. This allows for the estimation of restorative potential across the entire area, rather than just at the central points of each grid.

In terms of training a model for restorative potential, it is possible that the criteria for determining when training is complete could involve monitoring the validation loss or other metrics related to the accuracy of the model's predictions. However, this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.

The text also discusses the importance of developing a method for quantitative assessment of restorative quality to improve the effectiveness of landscape planning and design. This suggests that ongoing training and refinement of the restorative potential model could be an important part of this process.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information on the criteria used to determine when training is complete for a restorative potential model, it does provide insight into the use of such a model in urban planning and design, as well as the importance of ongoing training and refinement for quantitative assessment of restorative quality.
