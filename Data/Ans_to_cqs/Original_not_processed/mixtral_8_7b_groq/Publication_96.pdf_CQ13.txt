Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome include the learning rate, batch size, number of interactions, and inputs for classification. The learning rate was set to 0.001, and the batch size was defined as 1,000. The number of interactions, or training iterations, was set to 7,000.

For the inputs of the classification model, the authors selected four spectral bands from the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) satellite images, specifically the red (RED - 0.65 μm), near-infrared (NIR - 0.86 μm), and shortwave infrared (SWIR 1 - 1.6 μm and SWIR 2 - 2.2 μm) bands. These bands were chosen due to their sensitivity to fire events. Additionally, Landsat bands 2 to 7, NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), NBR, and delta NBR (Difference Normalized Burned Index) were tested during the training phase.

The training data input was split into two categories: burned area (BA) and non-burned areas. The spectral training samples of burned and non-burned areas were collected for the entire study area and were well distributed in space.

The deep learning model used in this study is a Deep Neural Network (DNN), which includes a learning algorithm based on an artificial neural network. The DNN model was trained using graphics processing units (GPUs) and specialized hardware components for running parallel arithmetic operations on the Google Cloud Platform.

It is important to note that the specific type of optimizer used in the deep learning model is not mentioned in the provided context.
