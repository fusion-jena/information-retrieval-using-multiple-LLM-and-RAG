Based on the provided context, the specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models are not explicitly mentioned. However, both TensorFlow and PyTorch are widely used and popular frameworks for building deep learning models. Given that the paper was published in the Ecological Informatics journal, it is likely that the authors used one of these two frameworks, or possibly a similar open-source machine learning library, to build and train their models.

The context does provide information on the architecture and components of the deep learning models used in the study. These models include various layers such as Conv2d, BatchNorm2d, Relu, UpsamplingNearest2d, and EmbeddingLayer. These layers are commonly used in both TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Furthermore, the paper mentions the use of data augmentation techniques such as ACGAN and MixUp, which are also available in both TensorFlow and PyTorch. The authors also implemented dynamic convolution, which is a more advanced technique that can be implemented using custom layers in both TensorFlow and PyTorch.

Therefore, while the specific deep learning framework is not explicitly stated in the provided context, it is likely that either TensorFlow or PyTorch was used to build and train the models, given the common usage of these frameworks and the availability of the required layers and techniques within them.
