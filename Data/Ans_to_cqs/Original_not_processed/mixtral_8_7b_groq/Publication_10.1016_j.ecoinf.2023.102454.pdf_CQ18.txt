Based on the provided context, there is no specific strategy mentioned for monitoring the model performance during training. The text focuses on the methodology and data used for constructing provincial-scale fitting models, but it does not discuss the training process or how the performance of the model is evaluated during this process.

The context does provide information on the data sources, the formula used for calculating CO2 emissions, and the CRediT authorship contribution statement, which lists the roles of the authors in the study. However, it does not mention any techniques for monitoring the model performance during training.

It is important to note that monitoring the performance of a model during training is a crucial step in building a reliable and accurate model. This can be done using various techniques such as validation curves, cross-validation, early stopping, and learning rate schedules. These techniques help to ensure that the model is not overfitting or underfitting the data, and that it is generalizing well to unseen data.

Therefore, while the context provides valuable information about the study, it does not answer the query regarding the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
