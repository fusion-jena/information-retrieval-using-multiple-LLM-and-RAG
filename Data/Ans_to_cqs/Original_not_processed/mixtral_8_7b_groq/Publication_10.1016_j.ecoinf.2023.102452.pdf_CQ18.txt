Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves a standard data split approach, where 70% of the available data is used for model training and the remaining 30% is dedicated to testing and evaluating the results. This approach allows for the assessment of the model's ability to generalize from the training data to unseen data. Additionally, the study utilizes the Eureka Pro software for GP modeling, which provides statistical performance results such as Mean Absolute Error (MEE), Determinant of Covariance Matrix (DW), Determinant of Weighted Covariance Matrix (DWE), and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) for both the training and testing phases. These statistical measures help in evaluating the model's performance and identifying any overfitting or underfitting issues during the training process.
