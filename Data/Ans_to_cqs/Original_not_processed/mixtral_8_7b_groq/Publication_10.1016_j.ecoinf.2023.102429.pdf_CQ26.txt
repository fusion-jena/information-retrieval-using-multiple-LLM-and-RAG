The provided context discusses various spectral analysis and pre-processing techniques used in a study related to the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) but does not explicitly mention techniques to address data bias during pre-processing of a deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general techniques used to address data bias during pre-processing, which may be applicable to various studies, including spectral analysis.

Answer:::
In the context of deep learning and machine learning, data pre-processing plays a crucial role in addressing data bias. Data bias can occur due to various factors, such as unequal representation, measurement errors, or unrepresentative sampling. Here are some common techniques used to address data bias during pre-processing:

1. **Stratified sampling**: Stratified sampling is a method of sampling that ensures each stratum (a subgroup of the population) is proportionally represented in the sample. This technique can help ensure that the training data is representative of the entire population and reduce bias.

2. **Oversampling**: Oversampling is a technique used to increase the representation of a minority class in the training data. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

3. **Undersampling**: Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the representation of a majority class in the training data. This can help prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

4. **Synthetic data generation**: Synthetic data generation is a technique used to create new data points based on the existing data. This can help increase the representation of minority classes and reduce bias.

5. **Data augmentation**: Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of the training data by applying transformations (such as rotation, scaling, or flipping) to the existing data. This can help prevent overfitting and reduce bias.

6. **Diverse data collection**: Diverse data collection involves collecting data from various sources, domains, or populations. This can help ensure that the training data is representative of the entire population and reduce bias.

While the provided context does not mention these specific techniques, they are commonly used in pre-processing for deep learning pipelines to address data bias.
