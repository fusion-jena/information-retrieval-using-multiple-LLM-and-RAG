Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context mainly focuses on the use of deep learning for monitoring ecosystem service change and assessing land degradation.

However, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was likely to have been serialized, which is the process of saving the model's architecture and learned parameters to a file, so that it can be reloaded and used for making predictions on new data. This is a common practice in deep learning to ensure that the trained model can be easily shared and deployed.

As for the platform selection, the context does not provide any details about it. The deep learning model could have been deployed on a local machine, a server, or a cloud platform, depending on the requirements of the application.

Furthermore, the context mentions that in future research, data from the Basic Soil Property Dataset of High-resolution China Soil Information Grids and HWSD should be processed jointly to improve temporal and spatial accuracy. This suggests that the deep learning model developed in the study might have been deployed in an offline setting for research purposes, rather than as a part of a larger production system.

Therefore, while the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model is not provided in the context, it can be inferred that the model was likely to have been serialized, and the platform selection would have depended on the specific requirements of the application.
