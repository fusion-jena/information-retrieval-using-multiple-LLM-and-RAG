Answer:::

The context provided does not give specific information about how the hyperparameters of the models are optimized. However, it mentions two models, Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) and BIOCLIM, and the hyperparameters involved in the CNN model.

In the context, the hyperparameters involved in convolution operations are the size and number of kernels. The size could be anything from 3 × 3 to 5 × 5 to 7 × 7, and the kernel could be chosen randomly. However, it does not specify how these hyperparameters are optimized.

In general, hyperparameters of models can be optimized using various methods such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and more. Grid search and random search are exhaustive search methods where the model is trained for every combination of hyperparameters in a predefined grid or random set. Bayesian optimization, on the other hand, uses a probabilistic approach to find the optimal set of hyperparameters.

In the case of the BIOCLIM model, the context mentions that it assigns equal weight to each variable and produces binary predictions. However, it does not specify how the model's hyperparameters are optimized.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer how the hyperparameters of the models are optimized.
