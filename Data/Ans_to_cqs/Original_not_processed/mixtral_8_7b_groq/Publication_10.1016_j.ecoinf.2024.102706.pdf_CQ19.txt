The provided context does not contain information about the use of deep learning methods in the study. Therefore, I cannot specify which frameworks were used to build deep learning models such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The study mainly focuses on machine learning models, including linear regression, Enet, SVM, RF, XGboost, and LightGBM, to predict canopy cover from planet data. The models were built using Python 3.12.2, Scikit-learn library, and the respective Python libraries for XGboost and LightGBM. However, there is no mention of deep learning frameworks in the given context.
