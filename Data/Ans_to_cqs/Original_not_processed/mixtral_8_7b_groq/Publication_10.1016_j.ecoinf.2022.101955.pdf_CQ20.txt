The provided context discusses the use of machine learning algorithms, including artificial neural networks (ANNs), for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training deep learning models such as ANNs.

Typically, deep learning models require significant computational power for training, and graphics processing units (GPUs) are commonly used due to their ability to perform parallel processing. This makes GPUs more efficient than central processing units (CPUs) for deep learning tasks. Additionally, there are specialized hardware resources like tensor processing units (TPUs) developed by Google, which are specifically designed to accelerate machine learning tasks.

However, the context provided here focuses on the methodology and applications of machine learning algorithms for LULC classification and does not delve into the technical details of hardware resources used for training deep learning models. Therefore, a precise answer to the query cannot be provided based on the given context.
