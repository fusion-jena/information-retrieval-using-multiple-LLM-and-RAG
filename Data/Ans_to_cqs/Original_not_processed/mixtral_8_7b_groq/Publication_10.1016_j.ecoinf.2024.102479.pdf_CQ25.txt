Based on the provided context, the specific type of deep learning model used is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), as mentioned in Model 5 of Table 1. However, the exact purpose of this ANN model (e.g., classification, segmentation, detection) is not explicitly stated in the text.

To infer the purpose of the ANN model, we can look at the tuned parameter for this model, which is 'Hiddenlayer Neurons_per_layer'. This parameter suggests that the ANN model is likely used for a regression or prediction task, as the number of neurons per layer is being tuned. Classification and detection tasks typically involve optimizing parameters related to classes or categories, which is not the case here. Segmentation tasks might involve optimizing neurons per layer, but it usually requires additional parameters such as kernel size or activation functions that are not mentioned in the table.

Furthermore, the context mentions that the models, including the ANN, are used for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) using remote sensing data. This biomass estimation is a prediction or regression task, where the model learns to predict AGB values based on input features. Therefore, it is plausible to infer that the purpose of the ANN model in this study is for regression, specifically for estimating AGB values.
