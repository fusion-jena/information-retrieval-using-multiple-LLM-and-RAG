The provided context does not include specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the CNN model used in the study requires equally sized input images, which implies some form of image annotation was used. The time-frequency input window size of 2 seconds was chosen as it is near the mean and median template duration across target call types. This suggests that the annotations may be related to time-series data or audio recordings, where the duration of the annotation is important.

The context also mentions that a pre-trained ResNet50 model was used, which was originally trained on the ImageNet dataset. ImageNet is a large-scale image recognition dataset, and the models trained on it are typically used for object detection or image classification tasks. Therefore, it is possible that bounding box annotation or some form of image segmentation was used for the ImageNet dataset. However, without further information, it is not possible to definitively say what data annotation techniques were used in this deep learning pipeline.
