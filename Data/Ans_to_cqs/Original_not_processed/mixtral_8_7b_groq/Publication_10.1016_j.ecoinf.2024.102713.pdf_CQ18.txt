Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training in the context provided is not explicitly stated. However, based on the information given, we can infer that the model performance is monitored using a combination of statistical methods and visualization tools.

Firstly, gauges are used to provide statistics on the coverage, which suggests that the model's performance in terms of data capture and representation is being monitored. These statistics could include metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, which are commonly used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models.

Secondly, interactive dashboards are provided, which allow for the reporting of data at different levels of detail. This could include plotting trends of captures at the provincial level or showing all the data communicated by an on-field operator through CASE on a given date for a given trap. These dashboards would enable the monitoring of the model's performance in real-time, allowing for adjustments to be made as necessary.

Thirdly, a weekly bulletin is provided by domain experts to summarize the latest events in the monitoring network. This human intervention in the monitoring process suggests that the model's performance is being evaluated not only through quantitative metrics but also through expert analysis and interpretation.

Finally, a multidimensional spatial cube called Captures is created in the Access tier, which offers efficient support to query answering. This cube could be used to evaluate the model's performance by analyzing the data from different dimensions, such as trap locations and survey years.

In conclusion, while the specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated, it can be inferred that a combination of statistical methods, visualization tools, human analysis, and multidimensional data analysis is being used to monitor the model's performance in real-time and make adjustments as necessary.
