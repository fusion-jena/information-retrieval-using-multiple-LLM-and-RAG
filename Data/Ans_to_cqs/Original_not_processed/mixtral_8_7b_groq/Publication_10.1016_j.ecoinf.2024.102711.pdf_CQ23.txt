The generalizability of a deep learning model, which is its ability to perform well on unseen data, is an important aspect of model development. Based on the provided context, several measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.

Firstly, the development dataset was divided into two categories: the training dataset and the tuning dataset. This division allowed for the optimization of hyperparameters using k-fold cross-validation. In this technique, the development dataset is evenly divided into k groups, and during each iteration, one group (the tuning dataset) is excluded from the training process. The model is then developed using the remaining dataset (the training dataset), and its performance is evaluated using the tuning dataset. The average performance of the k models developed on the validation groups represents the performance of the machine learning technique for the selected hyperparameters. This approach helps in avoiding overfitting and enhances the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data. For this study, a value of 5 is assumed for k.

Secondly, grid search was employed to evaluate the data-driven model's performance using each combination of predefined hyperparameters and identify the best hyperparameters. Hyperparameters such as the maximum depth of the tree, the number of trees in the ensemble model, and the learning rate were tuned in this study as the influential hyperparameters. The tuning of these hyperparameters allows for the development of a model that can generalize well to new data.

Lastly, the use of the AutoML models, specifically TabPFN and AutoGluon, resulted in high accuracy and F1-score, indicating that the models were able to generalize well to the independent evaluation dataset. The AutoML models achieved an Accuracy of 91% and 87%, respectively, and a F1-score of 93% for both models. These results suggest that the models were able to perform well on unseen data, indicating good generalizability.

In conclusion, the generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through the use of k-fold cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and the use of AutoML models. These measures allowed for the development of a model that can perform well on unseen data, thereby increasing its generalizability.
