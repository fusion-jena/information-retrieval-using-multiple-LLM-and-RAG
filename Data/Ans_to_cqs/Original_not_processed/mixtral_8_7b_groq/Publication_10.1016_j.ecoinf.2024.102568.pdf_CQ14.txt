Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The context discusses various topics related to communication technology, geographic information systems, spatial interpolation methods, and optimization techniques. However, it does not mention any specific method used for hyperparameter optimization such as grid search, random search, or others.

Hyperparameter optimization is an essential step in machine learning model building, as it helps to find the best set of hyperparameters that can improve the model's performance. Grid search and random search are two common methods used for hyperparameter optimization. Grid search involves creating a grid of hyperparameter values and training the model for each combination of hyperparameters. Random search, on the other hand, involves randomly selecting hyperparameter values and training the model for each set of randomly selected hyperparameters.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
