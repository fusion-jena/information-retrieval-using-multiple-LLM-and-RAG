The provided context does not include information on the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline of the mentioned studies. However, some of the studies do discuss the data and methods used.

In the study "Deep residual learning for image recognition" by He et al., 2016, the authors introduce a residual learning framework for training deep neural networks. They use the ImageNet dataset, which contains 1.2 million images for training and 50,000 for validation, but there is no mention of data augmentation techniques.

In the study "BirdNET: a deep learning solution for avian diversity monitoring" by Kahl et al., 2021, the authors developed a deep learning model for bird species identification using audio recordings. They created the "Agmon annotated dataset" which comprises over 10,900 annotated recordings of >75 species. However, the study does not mention any data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

In the study "Parsing birdsong with deep audio embeddings" by Tolkova et al., 2021, the authors used a dataset of 1,250 recordings of 25 bird species, but there is no mention of data augmentation techniques.

In the study "Feature embeddings from the BirdNET algorithm provide insights into avian ecology" by McGinn et al., 2023, the authors used the BirdNET algorithm to extract feature embeddings from bird songs. However, the study does not provide information on the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline of the mentioned studies.
