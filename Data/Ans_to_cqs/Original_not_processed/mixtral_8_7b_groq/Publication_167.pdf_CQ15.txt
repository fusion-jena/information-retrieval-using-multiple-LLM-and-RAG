Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline described in the given text uses the Adam optimization algorithm.

The loss function and the Adam optimization algorithm are specifically mentioned as being used to update the weights of the neural network. The Adam optimization algorithm is a popular choice for training deep learning models due to its efficiency and ability to adapt to different learning rates for each parameter. It is an extension of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm, which updates the weights of the model by computing the gradient of the loss function for a single training example or a small batch of examples. In contrast, Adam computes the average of the gradients and the squared gradients over the entire mini-batch, which results in more stable and efficient updates.

Furthermore, the text mentions that a relatively large weight is generated for the categories that have fewer samples, and a small weight is generated for the categories that have more samples. This technique is known as class weighting or sample weighting, and it is used to handle the class imbalance problem. By assigning a higher weight to the minority classes, the model is encouraged to pay more attention to those classes during training, which can improve the model's performance for those classes.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline described in the given text uses the Adam optimization algorithm and class weighting to optimize the model's performance.
