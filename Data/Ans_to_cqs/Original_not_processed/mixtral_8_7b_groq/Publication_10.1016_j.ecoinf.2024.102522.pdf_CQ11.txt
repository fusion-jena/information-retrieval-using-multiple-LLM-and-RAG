Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct information given about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study by Jiangxia Ye and colleagues. The papers mentioned in the context do not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.

However, the paper "Detecting Zimbabweâ€™s decadal economic decline using nighttime light imagery" by Li, X., Ge, L.L., Chen, X.L., (2013) does mention the use of DMSP/OLS nighttime light data, which can be obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Additionally, the paper "Mapping construction land of Guangzhou based on Luojia no.1 nightlight data" by Li, X., Zhu, J., Yin, X.D., Yao, J.C., Huang, J.L., Li, M.T., (2019) mentions the use of Luojia 1-02 nighttime light data, which can be obtained from the Wuhan University Center for Global Environmental Data Exploration.

It is also stated that "Data will be made available on request" in one of the papers, but there is no information on how to request the data.

Therefore, I would recommend contacting the authors of the study directly to inquire about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
