Answer:

The provided context discusses the use of remote sensing data, specifically optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, in support vector machine (SVM) models for predicting above-ground biomass (AGB). However, it does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline.

In the context of remote sensing and SVM models, the data formats are likely to be raster images, which are used to represent optical and SAR data. These raster images can be in various formats such as GeoTIFF, ENVI, or HDF.

In the more general context of deep learning pipelines, the data formats can vary widely depending on the specific application. For image-based tasks, such as object detection or image segmentation, the data format is likely to be raster images. For audio-based tasks, such as speech recognition or music analysis, the data format is likely to be audio files, such as WAV or MP3. For video-based tasks, such as action recognition or video segmentation, the data format is likely to be video files, such as MP4 or AVI. For tabular data, such as financial data or sensor data, the data format is likely to be CSV or JSON.

Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query without additional context. However, in general, the data formats used in deep learning pipelines depend on the specific application and the type of data being used.
