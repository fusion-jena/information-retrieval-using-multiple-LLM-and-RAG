Answer:::
I am unable to provide the exact code repository link of the deep learning pipeline as it was not included in the provided context. However, based on the information given, the authors used high spatial resolution satellite images from Landsat-8, GF-1, and Sentinel-2A for their research on ecosystem carbon cycle estimation in the upper reaches of the Chishui River Basin. They also used a deep learning model to estimate LAI (Leaf Area Index) from the satellite images.

Therefore, it is possible that the code repository for the deep learning pipeline may be found in one of the data sources mentioned, such as the USGS Earth Explorer website for Landsat-8, the CRESDA data center for GF-1, or the Copernicus Data Space for Sentinel-2A.

Additionally, the authors may have used common deep learning libraries and frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for their pipeline. Therefore, it may be helpful to look for repositories that use these libraries and frameworks and are related to the research topic of ecosystem carbon cycle estimation.

Overall, while I cannot provide the exact link to the code repository, the information given can help guide the search for it.
