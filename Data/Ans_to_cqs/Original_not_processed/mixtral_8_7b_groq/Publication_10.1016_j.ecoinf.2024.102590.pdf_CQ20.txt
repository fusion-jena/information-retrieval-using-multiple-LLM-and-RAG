The provided context does not give information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text focuses on the methodology used for land use and land cover (LULC) analysis, specifically in the context of mapping woody cover in the Kruger National Park (KNP). It discusses the use of remote sensing data, such as Landsat 8 data and Sentinel-1 C-band time series data, as well as the application of random forest and deep learning techniques for LULC analysis. However, it does not mention any details about the computational infrastructure used for training the deep learning model.
