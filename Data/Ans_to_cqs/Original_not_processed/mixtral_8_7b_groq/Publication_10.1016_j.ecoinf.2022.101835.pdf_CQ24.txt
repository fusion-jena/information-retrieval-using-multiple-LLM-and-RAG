Answer:::

In the context provided, there are two strategies employed to handle randomness in the machine learning models, although they are not specific to deep learning pipelines. These strategies are bagging and the use of a random seed value.

Bagging, or bootstrap aggregating, is a technique used to improve the stability and accuracy of machine learning algorithms. It involves creating multiple subsets of the original data, training a model on each subset, and then combining the predictions of each model to produce a final prediction. The subsets of data are created by randomly sampling the original data with replacement. This means that some data points may be included in a subset multiple times, while others may not be included at all. By using bagging, the impact of any individual data point on the final prediction is reduced, which can help to reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

The use of a random seed value is another strategy used to handle randomness in machine learning models. A random seed value is a fixed number that is used to initialize the random number generator in a program. By setting the random seed value to the same number every time a model is trained, the same sequence of random numbers will be generated, which will result in the same initial weights being used in the model. This can help to ensure that the results of different training runs are reproducible, which is important for scientific research and for comparing the performance of different models.

In the context provided, the bagging_freq parameter is used to control the frequency at which bagging is employed in the LightGBM model. Specifically, bagging is applied every bagging_freq iterations during the training of the model. This can help to reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

In summary, while the context provided does not specifically mention strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, it does describe the use of bagging and a fixed random seed value as strategies for handling randomness in machine learning models more generally. Bagging can help to reduce overfitting and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data, while a fixed random seed value can help to ensure that the results of different training runs are reproducible.
