The provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that several individuals are involved in "Data curation," which generally refers to the process of collecting, cleaning, organizing, and storing data for use in analysis or research.

From this, we can infer that these individuals are working with data in some capacity, and it's likely that they are using various data formats suitable for deep learning tasks. Here are some examples of data formats commonly used in deep learning:

1. Images: Image files such as JPEG, PNG, and TIFF are widely used in computer vision tasks. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are often employed for image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
2. Audio: Audio files like WAV and MP3 are used in audio signal processing and speech recognition tasks. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are often used for these applications.
3. Video: Video data is typically stored in formats such as MP4 or AVI. For video analysis, 3D CNNs or CNNs combined with RNNs are often used for tasks like action recognition and object detection in video.
4. Text: Text data is usually stored in plain text files (TXT) or CSV files. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as RNNs, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, or Transformer models, are commonly used for text analysis tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, and language translation.
5. CSV: CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are used to store tabular data, which can include various data types like numerical, categorical, or text data. These files can be used for regression, classification, or clustering tasks, depending on the problem at hand.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention data curation as one of the responsibilities of the team members. Based on common practices in deep learning, it's likely that they are working with various data formats, including images, audio, video, text, and CSV files.
