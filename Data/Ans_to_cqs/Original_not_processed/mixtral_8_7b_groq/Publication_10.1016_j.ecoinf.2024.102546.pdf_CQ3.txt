Answer:::

The pieces of context provided do not directly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, they do mention some types of annotations that are commonly used in the context of agricultural image datasets, which are relevant to the field of deep learning.

One of the annotation techniques mentioned is bounding box annotation. This technique involves drawing a rectangle around an object of interest in an image, which helps the model to learn to detect and recognize the object. For example, in the CropAndWeed dataset (Steininger et al., 2023), only 8,034 images were labeled, and among them, 5,764 bounding box instances were annotated. Similarly, Olaniyi et al. (2023) collected 36,374 RGB images and annotated 500 images with 5,764 bounding box instances.

Another annotation technique that is relevant to deep learning is instance segmentation. This technique involves labeling each pixel of an object of interest in an image, which helps the model to learn to segment and recognize the object at the pixel level. Although the pieces of context do not explicitly mention instance segmentation, they do mention some datasets that include pixel-level annotations. For example, the Eden Library (Mylonas et al., 2022) consisted of 6,428 images captured by proximal sensing platforms and UAVs in field conditions, for 15 crops and 9 weed species by a handful of imaging devices. Emphasizing on-field image diversity, the database covered different crop health conditions involving 30 disorders, which can be beneficial for model robustness.

In summary, while the pieces of context do not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, they do mention some types of annotations that are commonly used in the context of agricultural image datasets. These include bounding box annotation and pixel-level annotation, which are relevant to the field of deep learning.
