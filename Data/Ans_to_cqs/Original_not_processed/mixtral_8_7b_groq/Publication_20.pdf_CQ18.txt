Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that they stopped the network training after 70 epochs to prevent overfitting, which suggests that they were monitoring the model's performance during training to check for signs of overfitting. Additionally, they used a learning rate decay with a Gamma of 0.95, a dropout of 50%, and an Adam Solver type as learning parameters, which are all techniques used to improve model performance and prevent overfitting during training. Therefore, while the specific strategy for monitoring performance is not described, it is clear that they were taking steps to ensure the model was not overfitting and was performing well during training.
