Answer:::
The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It mentions the creation of a dataset called WSGD, but it does not specify where this dataset or the code for the Res_AUNet network can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query. However, it is common for researchers to make their data and code available on platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GitHub, so it may be worth checking these sites for the associated research materials.
