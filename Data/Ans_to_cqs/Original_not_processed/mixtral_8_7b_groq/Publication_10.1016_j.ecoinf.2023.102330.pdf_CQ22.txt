The deep learning model's performance is evaluated using the metrics of accuracy, precision, and recall. After analyzing recordings using a previously developed CNN model trained on covey call spectrogram data, the model detects and localizes all covey calls per ARU during the recording period. It notes their associated time and peak power (dB). The model uses a conservative score threshold of 0.95, where only calls that receive a score of 0.95 or higher are officially classified as a positive bobwhite detection.

To evaluate the model's accuracy and calculate a false positive rate, all CNN detections at a 0.95 score threshold from a random sample of five one-hour files from each year are manually reviewed. The metric 'accuracy' is calculated as the ratio of the correctly classified detections (true positives) to the total number of detections (true positives + false positives).

Precision, another evaluation metric, is the ratio of correctly classified detections (true positives) to the total number of positive classifications (true positives + false positives). It helps assess the model's ability to avoid falsely identifying non-bobwhite calls as positive detections.

Recall, the third metric, is the ratio of correctly classified detections (true positives) to the actual number of bobwhite calls in the dataset (true positives + false negatives). It measures the model's ability to identify all actual bobwhite calls in the dataset.

These metrics (accuracy, precision, and recall) provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance in detecting and classifying bobwhite calls.
