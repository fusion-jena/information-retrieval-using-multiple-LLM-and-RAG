Based on the provided context, there is no information about the specific deep learning model used in the pipeline. The context discusses the evaluation of thematic maps produced by a calibrated statistical prediction method, but it does not mention any deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), or Transformers.

The context does mention the use of machine learning approaches for estimating aboveground biomass and applying machine learning for evaluating spatiotemporal models of fine particulate matter using satellite data. However, it does not specify the type of deep learning model used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query about the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
