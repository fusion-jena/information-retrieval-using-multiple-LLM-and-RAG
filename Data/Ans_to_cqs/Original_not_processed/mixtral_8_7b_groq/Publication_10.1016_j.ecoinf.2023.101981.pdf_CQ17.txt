The provided context does not contain information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses statistical analyses and a study on Sika and Red Deer vocalizations, including the use of machine learning algorithms for detecting ungulate vocalizations. However, it does not mention any regularization techniques such as dropout, L2 regularization, or others. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the given context.
