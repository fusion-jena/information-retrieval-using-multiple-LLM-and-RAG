Answer:::

The hyperparameters of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model in this study were optimized using a sensitivity analysis method, as described in Heydari and Mountrakis (2018). Specifically, a grid search approach was used to find the best combination of gamma and cost parameters for the RBF kernel and the SVM model, respectively.

For the gamma parameter, values ranging from 0.01 to 300 were tested, with a step size of 0.01, 0.1, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, or 100. For the cost parameter, values ranging from 0.1 to 50 were tested, with a step size of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, or 50.

To optimize the hyperparameters, 50% of the reference data were randomly selected for parameter optimization. The highest overall accuracy achieved from different parameter combinations was then selected to set the gamma and cost parameters to 2 and 10, respectively.

For the Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) model, the number of nodes in the first, second, and third hidden layers, batch size, and number of iterations were set using a range of values. Specifically, the number of nodes in the first, second, and third hidden layers were set to range from 6 to 60, with a step size of 6. The batch size was set to range from 10 to 100, with a step size of 10. The number of iterations was set to 10,000.

The optimal number of iterations for the SAE model was estimated using a mean error and number of misclassified points, as shown in Figure 6. The number in the color bar stands for the density of points.

The key parameter values/range setting of the SAE classifier are presented in Table 3. The highest J-M value (ranging from 1.69 to 1.81) among the six types of Landsat images was used to determine the optimal hyperparameters for the SAE model.

Therefore, the hyperparameters of both the SVM and SAE models were optimized using a systematic approach of testing a range of values and selecting the best combination based on the highest overall accuracy or J-M value. However, the specific method of hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search, was not explicitly mentioned in the study.
