Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about which deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used to build the predictive model. The context discusses the use of machine learning for species identification and the reduction of manual labor in predicting means, standard deviations, and population sizes based on observed data. It also mentions the use of R-code for running the model with a sample of 10,000. However, it does not specify any deep learning frameworks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query with certainty.
