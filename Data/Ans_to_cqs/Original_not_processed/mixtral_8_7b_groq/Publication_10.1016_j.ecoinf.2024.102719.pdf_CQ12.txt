Answer:::
Based on the given context, there is no explicit mention of the specific type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The text only states that deep learning models have been employed in river health predictions, but it does not provide information on which type of deep learning model was used in the study by Zamri et al., 2023. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific model type (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) as the answer to this query.
