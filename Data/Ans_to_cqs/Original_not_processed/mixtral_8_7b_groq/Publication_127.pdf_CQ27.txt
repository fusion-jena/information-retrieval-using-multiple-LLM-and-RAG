Answer:::

The provided context does not contain specific information on the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model. However, it does give insights into various deep learning architectures and models. Once a deep learning model is trained, it is typically necessary to serialize the model and select an appropriate platform for deployment.

Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model's architecture, weights, and biases to a file, allowing it to be loaded and used for making predictions on new data. Common model serialization formats include HDF5, JSON, and XML. The choice of serialization format may depend on the platform used for deployment.

Platform selection is an essential step in deploying a deep learning model. The choice of platform depends on factors such as the required computational resources, the need for real-time inference, and the target environment (e.g., cloud, edge device). Various platforms are available for deep learning model deployment, including TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, and ONNX Runtime.

TensorFlow Serving is an open-source platform for deploying TensorFlow models in production. It allows for model versioning, automatic scaling, and monitoring. TensorFlow Serving supports model serialization formats such as SavedModel and Tensorflow Checkpoint.

TorchServe is a similar platform for deploying PyTorch models. It provides features such as model versioning, load balancing, and monitoring. TorchServe supports model serialization formats such as PyTorch's native serialization format and ONNX.

ONNX Runtime is an open-source platform for deploying models in ONNX format. It supports various deep learning frameworks, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. ONNX Runtime provides features such as optimized execution for various hardware platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs.

In summary, while the provided context does not contain specific information on the process followed to deploy a trained deep learning model, it is common to serialize the model and select an appropriate platform for deployment. TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, and ONNX Runtime are examples of platforms that can be used for deep learning model deployment.
