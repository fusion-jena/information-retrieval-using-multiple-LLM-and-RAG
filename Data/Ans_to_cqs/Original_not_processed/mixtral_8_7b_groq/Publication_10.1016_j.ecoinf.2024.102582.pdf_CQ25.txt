Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model used in the study by Lassalle et al., 2022 is for individual tree crown delineation in mangrove forests using very-high-resolution satellite imagery.

In the study, the deep learning model is specifically used to address the challenge of accurately delineating mangrove tree crowns in complex mangrove environments. The model is designed to improve the understanding of mangrove forest structure and biomass, which are critical for evaluating mangrove ecosystem health and carbon sequestration capacity.

The deep learning model used in this study is a type of semantic segmentation model, which is a pixel-wise classification approach. The model classifies each pixel in the satellite imagery as either belonging to a mangrove tree crown or not. By classifying each pixel, the model creates a segmented image where individual mangrove tree crowns are delineated.

The deep learning model used in this study is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The CNN architecture is chosen for its ability to learn and extract features from the satellite imagery data automatically. This is particularly important for mangrove tree crown delineation, as mangrove trees have complex structures and varying shapes, making it difficult to extract features manually.

The deep learning model is trained using a large number of annotated mangrove tree crown samples. These samples are generated using Google Earth Pro and imported into the GEE application programming interface (API) for further analysis. The samples are then randomly divided into training and validation datasets at a 7:3 ratio.

The random forest algorithm is applied to rapidly classify the land use types in the study area. Post-classification processing is then applied to the images, and a manual visual interpretation approach is used to correct the image classification results for mangroves within a 10-km buffer zone extending inland from the coastline. This procedure effectively corrects misclassifications between forest and mangroves resulting from "spectral confusion".

Overall, the deep learning model used in this study is a powerful tool for mangrove tree crown delineation in complex mangrove environments. The model's ability to learn and extract features from satellite imagery data automatically makes it a valuable tool for mangrove forest structure and biomass evaluation, which are critical for mangrove ecosystem health and carbon sequestration capacity assessment.
