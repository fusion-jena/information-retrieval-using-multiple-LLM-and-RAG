The provided context does not give specific information about the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as the learning rate or optimizer. However, it does mention that the code for defining and training the models can be found in Mathematica notebooks provided as supplementary materials. These notebooks may contain the necessary information regarding the hyperparameters used.

Answer:::
The hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as the learning rate or optimizer, are not explicitly stated in the provided context. To find this information, one would need to examine the Mathematica notebooks (Suppl. materials 1, 3, 2, 4) that contain the code used to define and train the models.
