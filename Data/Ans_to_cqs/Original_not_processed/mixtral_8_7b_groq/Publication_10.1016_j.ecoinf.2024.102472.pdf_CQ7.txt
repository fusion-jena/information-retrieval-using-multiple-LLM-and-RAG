Based on the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation data, are not explicitly mentioned. However, some insights can be inferred from the information given.

In the context, it is mentioned that the network was trained and then tested to estimate carbon stocks for both training and new input data without training data. This suggests that the data was divided into two sets: a training set and a test set. The training set was used to adjust connection weights until reaching a target minimal error, while the test set was used to verify the network's performance on new, unseen data.

Furthermore, it is stated that the network accurately estimated carbon stocks for both training and new input data without training data. This implies that a separate validation set, distinct from the training and test sets, might have been used during the model building process. The validation set serves as an additional data subset for evaluating the model's performance and tuning hyperparameters.

In the context, there is no explicit mention of validation data; however, it is mentioned that all hyperparameters were tuned with a grid search method. Grid search is a hyperparameter tuning technique that involves iterating over a range of possible hyperparameter values and testing the model's performance on a validation set to identify the best set of hyperparameters. Therefore, it can be inferred that a validation set was used during the hyperparameter tuning phase.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the criteria for splitting data into train, test, and validation sets, it can be inferred that the data was divided into a training set and a test set, and possibly a separate validation set for hyperparameter tuning.
