Based on the provided context, there are no specific details about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it is mentioned that a correlation analysis of the variables was conducted before model implementation to enhance the predictive performance of the model and mitigate the risk of overfitting.

The main focus of the study was on developing a method to analyze the species distribution model results, specifically for species that are comparatively more difficult to monitor. The study aimed to overcome the limitations of the Incidence Function Model (IFM) by concentrating on a minimum of 10 occupied patches in the study area for accurate parameterization.

The Figure 3 in the context shows the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves of seven machine learning models. The true positive rate (sensitivity) of the vertical line and the false positive rate (1-specificity) of the horizontal line quantify the proportion of correctly and incorrectly classified samples, respectively. The red and blue curves represent the mean area under the curve (AUC) of training and test data, respectively. However, there is no mention of any postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query regarding the postprocessing steps involved after the model training.
