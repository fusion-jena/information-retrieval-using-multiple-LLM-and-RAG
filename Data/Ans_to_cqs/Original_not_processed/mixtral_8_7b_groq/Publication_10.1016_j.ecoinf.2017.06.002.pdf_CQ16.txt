Based on the provided context, there is not enough information to determine the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for a given model or measurement system. The context describes various templates and data files related to the installation, measurement details, and metadata of some system, but it does not provide any information about the training or evaluation of a model.

In general, there are several common criteria used to determine when training is complete for a machine learning model, including:

1. Validation loss plateau: This is the most common criterion mentioned in the query. It involves monitoring the loss function (e.g., mean squared error, cross-entropy) on a validation set during training. If the loss function stops decreasing or starts increasing, it may indicate that the model has overfit the training data, and training can be stopped.
2. Early stopping: This is a regularization technique that involves stopping training before the validation loss starts increasing. This can help prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the model.
3. Patience: This is a hyperparameter that specifies how many epochs or iterations to wait before stopping training if the validation loss does not improve.
4. Minimum improvement: This is a hyperparameter that specifies the minimum improvement in the validation loss required to continue training.
5. Maximum number of epochs: This is a hyperparameter that specifies the maximum number of epochs or iterations to run during training.

These criteria can be used individually or in combination to determine when training is complete. However, the specific criteria used depend on the model, the data, and the problem at hand. Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to provide a specific answer to the query.
