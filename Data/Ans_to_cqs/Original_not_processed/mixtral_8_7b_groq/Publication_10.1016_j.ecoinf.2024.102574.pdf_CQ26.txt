The provided context discusses various methods used in remote sensing and forestry studies, but it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does touch upon some related concepts that can be applied in addressing data bias.

One such concept is the use of diverse data collection methods. In the context of remote sensing, this can mean integrating multiple data sources, such as GEDI, ICESat-2, UAV-LiDAR, hyperspectral, and high-resolution RGB data, to create a comprehensive dataset. This integrated dataset can help reduce data bias by providing a more holistic view of the study area.

Another concept is data preprocessing techniques like oversampling and undersampling. These methods can be used to balance the class distribution in a dataset, which can help reduce data bias. For instance, if one class has significantly more samples than another, oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class can help create a more balanced dataset.

Stratified splitting, although not explicitly mentioned in the context, is another technique that can be used to address data bias. Stratified splitting involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria (e.g., class labels) and then randomly sampling from each subgroup. This ensures that each subset of the data is representative of the entire dataset, reducing data bias.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, it does touch upon related concepts such as diverse data collection, oversampling/undersampling, and stratified splitting. These techniques can be applied to address data bias and improve the performance of deep learning models.
