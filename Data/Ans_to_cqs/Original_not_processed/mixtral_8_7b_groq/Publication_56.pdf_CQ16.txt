Answer:::
In the provided context, there is no specific information given about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. However, it is mentioned that the data was split into training and validation sets, with 70% of the data used for training and the remaining 30% used for validation. In the context of machine learning, training is often continued until the performance on the validation set stops improving, or until a plateau in validation loss is reached. This is a common approach to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on new, unseen data. Therefore, it is likely that in this case, the training was completed when the validation loss plateaued, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
