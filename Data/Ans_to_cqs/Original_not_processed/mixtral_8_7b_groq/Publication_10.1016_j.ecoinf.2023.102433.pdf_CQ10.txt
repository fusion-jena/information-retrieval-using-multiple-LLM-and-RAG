Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct information given about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline that uses the nasawebservice package. The text only describes the functionality of the nasawebservice package, which is a tool for querying the NASA service to discover available products for a given reference date.

However, it is common practice to include a link to the code repository in the documentation or README file of a package. Therefore, I would suggest looking at the documentation or README file of the nasawebservice package for more information.

If you are unable to find the code repository link in the documentation or README file, you could try searching for the package on popular code hosting platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. You can search for the package name "nasawebservice" on these platforms to see if there is a public repository available.

In summary, while the provided context does not give a direct answer to the query, I would recommend checking the package documentation or searching on code hosting platforms for the nasawebservice package to find the code repository link.
