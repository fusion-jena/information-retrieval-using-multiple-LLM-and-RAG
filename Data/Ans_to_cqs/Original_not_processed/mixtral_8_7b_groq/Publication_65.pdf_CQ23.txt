Answer:::

The research paper mentioned several measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning models used in the study. One of the techniques used was data augmentation. Data augmentation is a strategy that enables the creation of new training samples by applying transformations such as rotation, noise, and flipping to the existing data. This technique helps increase the robustness and generalizability of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification.

Another approach used to enhance the model's generalizability was the application of an exponential decay learning rate reduction technique. Specifically, after 50,000 iterations, the learning rate was reduced, which helped prevent overfitting and improved the model's ability to adapt to new, unseen data.

The deep learning models were implemented using TensorFlow, a Python framework designed for efficient deep learning implementation on Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The experiments were conducted on a workstation with an NVIDIAÂ® GTX 1080 GPU, which provided the computational power required for training the models.

The evaluation process followed a specific scheme (Figure 9) that included training and testing phases. Although the paper does not explicitly mention diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, the use of data augmentation, learning rate reduction, and a well-defined evaluation process collectively contribute to improving the generalizability of the models.

In summary, the study employed data augmentation, learning rate reduction, and a structured evaluation process to enhance the generalizability of the deep learning models. However, it does not explicitly mention the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
