Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text mentions that the study uses data from citizen science observations and remote sensing characterization of environmental heterogeneity, but it does not specify where this data is hosted or how to access it. Additionally, the study mentions using various data science tools and platforms such as INRIA, LIRMM, UMR AMAP, CIRAD, AMIS, Univ. Paul Valery Montpellier, Univ. Montpellier, CNRS, Montpellier, France, and LIPHY, Univ. Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Grenoble, France but it does not mention any data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide the data repository link based on the given context.
