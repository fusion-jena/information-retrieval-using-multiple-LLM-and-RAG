The provided context discusses a study related to invasive species distribution models (iSDM) and their sampling bias, rather than the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that some species records were sourced from surveys that recorded absence in addition to presence-only incidental records from the public. Therefore, we can infer that surveys and public datasets were used as methods for collecting raw data in this particular study.

Surveys are a common method for collecting raw data in many fields. They can be designed to target specific species or areas of interest and can include questions related to the presence or absence of a particular species. Surveys can be conducted by trained professionals or by members of the public, and they can be carried out through various mediums such as online forms, phone interviews, or in-person interviews.

Public datasets are another source of raw data that can be used in a deep learning pipeline. These datasets can be obtained from various organizations, such as government agencies, research institutions, or other groups that collect and share data. Public datasets can include a wide variety of information, such as species occurrence records, environmental data, or other relevant information.

In addition to surveys and public datasets, there are many other methods for collecting raw data that could be used in a deep learning pipeline. For example, sensors such as cameras, microphones, or other devices can be used to collect data automatically in real-time. These sensors can be placed in specific locations to monitor species or environmental conditions over time.

Overall, the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline will depend on the specific problem or question being addressed. Surveys and public datasets are two common methods that were mentioned in the provided context, but other methods such as sensors or other data collection techniques could also be used.
