The provided context discusses the evaluation of machine learning models, including some models that use deep learning techniques, but it does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models in the evaluation process. However, it does mention several metrics that are used to evaluate the performance of the models.

The metrics mentioned in the context are:

1. True positive rate (TPR): The true positive rate is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positive instances. It is also known as recall or sensitivity.
2. False positive rate (FPR): The false positive rate is the ratio of false positive predictions to the total actual negative instances.
3. Accuracy: Accuracy is the ratio of the total number of correct predictions to the total number of instances.

The context also mentions the use of the PBP method, which is a machine learning method that yielded a competitive performance associated with higher true-positive rates in most comparisons. The PBP method is an improvement over current state-of-the-art machine learning tools, especially by non-specialists, such as ecologists aiming to use a quantitative approach for pest monitoring.

The context also provides the performance of the PBP method for two specific stochastic models, namely the negative binomial (Ï• = 1.2) and Gaussian models. The performance metrics reported for these models include accuracy, false positive rate, and true positive rate.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the performance of machine learning models, including some models that use deep learning techniques, is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, false positive rate, and true positive rate (also known as recall or sensitivity).
