Answer:::
The deep learning pipeline for the conservation assessment of the Orchidaceae family is implemented in an R package called IUCNN, which is available in a GitHub repository. You can access the IUCNN GitHub repository using the following link: <https://github.com/azizka/IUCNN>. This pipeline is based on a deep neural network algorithm called IUC-NN, which was developed by Goodfellow et al. (2016) and implemented in Python using the TensorFlow library. The IUCNN R package provides a user-friendly interface to this deep learning pipeline, allowing researchers to predict the conservation status of unevaluated orchid species based on four groups of features: geographic, climatic, biome, and anthropogenic. These features are derived from digitally available occurrence records. The IUCNN package is part of a study published in Conservation Biology, which revealed global centers of orchid extinction risk using an automated conservation assessment with deep learning.
