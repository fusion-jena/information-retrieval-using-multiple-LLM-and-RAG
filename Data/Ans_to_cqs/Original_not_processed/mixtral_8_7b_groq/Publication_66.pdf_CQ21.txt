Based on the provided context, there are several postprocessing steps mentioned after the model training, although not all of them are specific to the creation or calculation of saliency maps.

Answer:
The postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics and the creation of confusion matrices. The metrics calculated are specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the models in predicting diving and non-diving behaviors of three different species.

In addition, confusion matrices are used to visualize the performance of the models. A confusion matrix is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm in terms of true and false positives and negatives. It is a summary of prediction results on a classification problem.

However, there is no explicit mention of saliency maps in the provided context. Saliency maps are a technique used in deep learning models to visualize the importance of input features in the prediction process. They are used to identify which parts of the input data the model is focusing on when making a prediction.

In summary, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training include the calculation of metrics such as specificity, sensitivity, PPV, and NPV, as well as the creation of confusion matrices. However, there is no explicit mention of saliency maps in the provided context.
