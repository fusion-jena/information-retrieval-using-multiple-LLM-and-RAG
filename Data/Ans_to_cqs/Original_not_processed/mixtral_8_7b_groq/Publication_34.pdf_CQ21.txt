Based on the provided context, there are several evaluation metrics calculated after training the models, including Mean Loss, which is the objective function minimized during model training. However, there is no explicit mention of post-processing steps such as saliency maps or confusion matrix.

The post-training evaluation process involves calculating the performance metrics for each species and for two subsets of sites: a training set and a test set. These metrics are then averaged over the 50 species. The models tested include MAXENT, a classic loglinear model, a single-layer neural network (SNN), a six-layer neural network (DNN), and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The learning of model parameters is done through optimization of an objective function, using stochastic gradient descent algorithms and the back-propagation algorithm for loss function gradient approximation.

The provided context focuses mainly on the model architectures, learning protocols, and evaluation metrics, without explicitly mentioning any post-processing steps like saliency maps or confusion matrix. Therefore, based on the given information, it can be concluded that there are no specific post-processing steps involved after the model training.
