Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate or the optimizer used in the deep learning model. The model in question is a ResNet-50 deep convolutional neural network (CNN) that was pre-trained using millions of label images in over 1000 categories. However, the specific hyperparameters used during its training are not mentioned.

The training process involved using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a cubic polynomial kernel, which was trained using the ResNet-50 fc1000 activations of the full training dataset. A 10-fold cross-validation was then used to define the score-to-posterior-probability transformation function. However, these steps are part of the post-processing phase, not the initial training of the ResNet-50 model.

Therefore, while we know many details about how the model was applied and used in this specific context, the hyperparameters used during the original training of the ResNet-50 model remain unknown based on the provided information.
