Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. However, I can provide some general steps that are commonly used in the field of remote sensing and geospatial analysis, which are related to the articles' subject matter.

When working with remote sensing data, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or Grassland Seasonal Net Primary Production (GSN), several preprocessing steps are usually applied before training a deep learning model:

1. **Data Acquisition**: The first step is to acquire the relevant data for the study area and time period of interest. This could involve downloading satellite images or other geospatial data from online repositories.

2. **Atmospheric Correction**: Remote sensing data often needs to be corrected for atmospheric effects, such as absorption and scattering of light by the atmosphere, which can affect the accuracy of the data. There are various methods for atmospheric correction, such as the Dark Object Subtraction (DOS) method or the 6S radiative transfer model.

3. **Geometric Correction**: This step involves aligning the data with a reference coordinate system to ensure that the spatial locations are accurate. This could involve techniques such as rubber sheeting or polynomial transformation.

4. **Radiometric Correction**: Radiometric correction aims to adjust the data for variations in sensor gain, offset, and other factors that can affect the brightness values in the data. This step is important for ensuring that the data is comparable across different images or sensors.

5. **Data Resampling**: Depending on the specific deep learning model and the size of the dataset, it might be necessary to resample the data to a lower resolution or to a different projection. This step can help reduce computational requirements and improve model performance.

6. **Data Normalization**: Normalization is a common preprocessing step for deep learning models, as it helps ensure that the input data is on a similar scale. This can be done using various methods, such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization.

7. **Data Augmentation**: In some cases, data augmentation techniques can be used to increase the size of the dataset and improve model generalization. This could involve techniques such as rotation, flipping, or cropping of the original images.

8. **Data Cleaning**: Data cleaning involves removing or correcting erroneous or missing data points. This step is important for ensuring that the model is trained on high-quality data.

In summary, while there is no specific information about the preprocessing steps for a deep learning model in the provided context, the following general steps are commonly applied when working with remote sensing data: data acquisition, atmospheric correction, geometric correction, radiometric correction, data resampling, data normalization, data augmentation, and data cleaning.
