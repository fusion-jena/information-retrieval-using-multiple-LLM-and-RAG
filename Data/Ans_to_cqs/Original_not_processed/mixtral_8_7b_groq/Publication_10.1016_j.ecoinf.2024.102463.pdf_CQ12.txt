Answer:::

The deep learning model used in the pipeline described in the article is a Hierarchical Attention-Based Recurrent Highway Networks (RHN) model with a convolution layer. The encoder part of the model utilizes both convolutional and recurrent layers to generate a latent representation of past exogenous variable data from a river, such as water discharge, release, and washout flux. A layer of Hierarchical Attention then weighs the importance of this representation. The decoder part of the model then processes this representation along with the past history of the target variable using another recurrent layer to predict the future concentration of 137Cs.

The use of a convolution layer in the encoder part of the model allows for the extraction of relevant temporal patterns in the data over a specified convolution window size. The number of filters used in the convolution layer determines the number of different patterns the network can learn. A higher number of filters allows for a more complex network, but it can also make training more difficult.

In summary, the deep learning model used in the pipeline described in the article is a Hierarchical Attention-Based Recurrent Highway Networks (RHN) model with a convolution layer in the encoder part. The convolution layer allows for the extraction of relevant temporal patterns in the data, and the number of filters used determines the number of different patterns the network can learn.
