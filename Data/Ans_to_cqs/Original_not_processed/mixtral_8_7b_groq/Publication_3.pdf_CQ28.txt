Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model. It is stated that TensorFlow's flexible architecture allows easy adaptation and deployment on different platforms, including desktops, clusters of servers, edge devices, and mobile phones. However, there is no specific information about the use of cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query.
