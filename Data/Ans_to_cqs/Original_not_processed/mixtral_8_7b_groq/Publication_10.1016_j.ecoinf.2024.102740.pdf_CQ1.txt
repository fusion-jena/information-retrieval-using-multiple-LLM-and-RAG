Answer:::

The provided context does not directly answer the query about the methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines. However, it does offer insights into the use of remote sensing techniques and machine learning (ML) classification methods in the context of grassland management and evaluation.

In the study by Askari et al. (2019), remote sensing techniques were used to evaluate grass quality under different soil management scenarios. Specifically, Red Green Blue (RGB) images acquired in March, April, and May were employed to perform classification using the Random Forest (RF) technique in the System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) software. This suggests that remote sensing data, such as images captured by satellites or drones, can be used as raw data in ML pipelines.

The study by Bourdôt et al. (2019) also utilized remote sensing data in conjunction with ML classification techniques to generate accurate, dynamic information on grassland core attributes. The researchers used ground data points, likely collected through field surveys, to train the ML model. This further highlights the use of multiple data sources, including both remote sensing data and ground-based surveys, in ML pipelines.

In the context of ML model training, Breiman (2001) explains that ML models, such as RF, can be trained using ground data points. These data points can be collected through various methods, including surveys, sensors, or public datasets. The study by Čarni et al. (2021) also used ground data points to study the forage quality of grasslands, although the specific method of data collection is not mentioned.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly answer the query, it suggests that raw data for deep learning pipelines can be collected through various methods, including remote sensing techniques, field surveys, sensors, and public datasets.
