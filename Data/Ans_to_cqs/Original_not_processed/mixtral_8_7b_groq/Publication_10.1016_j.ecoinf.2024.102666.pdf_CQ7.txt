Based on the provided context, there are no specific criteria mentioned for splitting the data into train, test, and validation sets for deep learning model training. However, there are some general practices followed in the field of remote sensing and deep learning for splitting the data, which could be applied in this context.

In remote sensing and deep learning, it is common to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the deep learning model, the validation set is used to tune the model's hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

A common split for remote sensing data is to use 70% of the data for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for testing. However, the split can vary depending on the size and quality of the data. For example, if the data set is small, a 50-25-25 split may be used instead.

In the context of the provided pieces of context, the data consists of satellite images and in-situ measured data. The satellite images have spectral channels in blue, green, red, and near-infrared, and the sensors used are MSI and OLCI. The in-situ measured data is used for the development and validation of an algorithm for chlorophyll-a retrieval and for a land use/land cover classification study.

When splitting the data, it is important to ensure that the split is representative of the entire data set. This means that the training, validation, and testing sets should have similar characteristics, such as the distribution of land cover classes, water turbidity levels, and atmospheric conditions.

In addition, it is important to avoid data leakage between the training, validation, and testing sets. Data leakage occurs when information from the testing set is used in the training or validation process, which can lead to overfitting and an overestimation of the model's performance.

Therefore, when splitting the data for deep learning model training in the context of remote sensing and the provided pieces of context, it is recommended to use a representative split, such as 70-15-15, and to avoid data leakage between the sets.
