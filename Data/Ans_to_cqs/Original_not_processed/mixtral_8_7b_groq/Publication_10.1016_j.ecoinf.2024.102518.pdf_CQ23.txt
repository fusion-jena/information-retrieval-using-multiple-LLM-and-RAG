Answer:::

The text provided does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model. However, it does discuss the generalizability of a species distribution model created using nine different algorithms, one of which is MaxEnt, a machine learning method often used for ecological niche modeling.

To ensure the generalizability of the model, several measures were taken. First, a diverse dataset was used. The dataset included 5,007,461 presences and 37,217 absences, providing a wide range of data for the model to learn from. 

Second, cross-validation was employed to assess the performance of the models. This technique involves dividing the dataset into training and validation sets, training the model on the former, and then testing it on the latter. This process was repeated multiple times with different subsets of the data to ensure that the model's performance was not dependent on a specific training set.

Third, the threshold for determining suitable habitat was derived from the average output of the five models, rather than a single model. This approach helps to reduce the impact of any idiosyncrasies in a single model's predictions.

Fourth, the study used two metrics, AUC-ROC and Cohen's KAPPA, to evaluate the models. This provides a more robust assessment of the models' performance than relying on a single metric.

Lastly, the study used the delta.AICc metric to determine the best tuning parameters for the model. This method compares different models and selects the one that best balances fit and complexity, which can help to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalizability.

Therefore, while not a deep learning model, the species distribution model discussed in the text was created using methods that generally contribute to the model's generalizability.
