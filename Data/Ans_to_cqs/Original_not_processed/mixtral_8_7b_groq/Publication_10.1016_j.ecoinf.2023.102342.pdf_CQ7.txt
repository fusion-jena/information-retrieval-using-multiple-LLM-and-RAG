Answer:::

The provided context does not directly mention the criteria used to split data for deep learning model training. However, it discusses the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, which includes data pre-selection and optimization, and data mining techniques such as the Apriori algorithm. These processes can provide insights into potential data splitting criteria.

In the context of KDD, the pre-selection of useful data is an essential step before applying data mining techniques. This step involves identifying the aim of a specific study area and selecting relevant data to achieve the objective. Therefore, it can be inferred that the criteria used to split the data could be based on the specific objectives and requirements of the study.

Furthermore, the Apriori algorithm, a data mining technique, consists of a sequence of steps for identifying the most frequent itemsets in a given database. This algorithm performs joining and pruning iteratively to locate the most frequent itemsets. Although the Apriori algorithm does not directly mention data splitting criteria, it implies that the algorithm requires a dataset to start with, which can be split into training and testing datasets.

In deep learning model training, data splitting is typically done using techniques such as random sampling, stratified sampling, or time-series splitting. Random sampling involves randomly splitting the data into training, testing, and validation sets. Stratified sampling ensures that each subset has a similar distribution of classes or labels. Time-series splitting is used when the data is collected over time, and the model is trained on past data and tested on future data.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, it can be inferred that the criteria used could be based on the specific objectives and requirements of the study, and the data splitting techniques commonly used in deep learning model training, such as random sampling, stratified sampling, or time-series splitting.
