Answer:::

Deep learning algorithms often involve optimization techniques to train models effectively. These techniques help to minimize the error between the predicted and actual values by adjusting the model's parameters. Two popular optimization techniques used in deep learning are Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple yet efficient optimization algorithm used in deep learning. It is an extension of the standard Gradient Descent algorithm, which updates the model's parameters by calculating the gradient of the loss function concerning each parameter. SGD introduces randomness by considering only one training example at a time, instead of the entire dataset, to calculate the gradient. This randomness accelerates the convergence of the algorithm and reduces the computational cost.

Adam, which stands for Adaptive Moment Estimation, is another optimization algorithm used in deep learning. Adam combines the advantages of two other optimization techniques, AdaGrad and RMSProp. AdaGrad adapts the learning rate for each parameter, while RMSProp uses a moving average of squared gradients to scale the learning rate. Adam estimates the first and second moments of the gradient to adapt the learning rate for each parameter, making it suitable for non-stationary objectives and sparse gradients.

These optimization techniques are crucial in the deep learning pipeline as they enable the training of complex models with large datasets. They help to find the optimal set of parameters that minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance.
