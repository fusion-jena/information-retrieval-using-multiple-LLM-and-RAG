The provided pieces of context do not directly discuss the deep learning pipeline or the methods used for collecting raw data in that pipeline. However, they do offer some insight into the data collection methods used in related ecological and environmental research.

In the study "Unintended consequences of combating desertification in China" (Su et al., 2023), the authors used a land use/cover dataset for China with a spatial resolution of 1 km Ã— 1 km, acquired from the Resource and Environmental Science Data Center (RESDC). This dataset includes land use/cover information from 1980 to 2018, covering six major land use/cover categories and twenty-six subcategories. The dataset was created through a combination of manual and automated interpretation, as well as on-site data validation. The primary land use/cover categories achieved an accuracy of over 93%, while the secondary categories had an accuracy exceeding 90%.

In the study "Global assessment of lagged and cumulative effects of drought on grassland gross primary production" (Wei et al., 2022), the authors used various datasets, including MODIS GPP (Grassland Gross Primary Production) data, CRU TS4.03 climate data, and GLC2000 and GLC30 land cover data. These datasets were acquired from different sources, such as the MODIS dataset from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the GLC2000 and GLC30 land cover datasets from the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC).

In the study "Time-lag effects of global vegetation responses to climate change" (Wu et al., 2015), the authors used several datasets, including the MODIS dataset from NASA, the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) dataset from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC), and the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) dataset from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

Based on these studies, the data collection methods used in related research include using remote sensing data from satellites (e.g., MODIS, GLDAS, and GIMMS datasets), land cover datasets (e.g., GLC2000 and GLC30), climate data (e.g., CRU TS4.03), and on-site data validation. While these studies do not specifically mention surveys or sensors in the context of deep learning pipelines, it is common in deep learning research to use a variety of data sources, including public datasets, sensors, and surveys.
