Answer:::

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline, as described in the given context, is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the multiple sources that mention or utilize CNNs for various tasks. 

In [16], a CNN was used to analyze crop images and compare the predictions with those using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The results showed that the CNN method considerably reduces the uncertainty in crop production. 

In another work [17], CNNs were used to quantify the number of citrus trees in an orchard, achieving 94% correctness in the tree counting task. 

CNNs also have a layer configuration, as mentioned in [18]-[20]. One such CNN is U-Net, which was initially designed for use in the biomedical area [21]. However, it has been used in various fields, including forest type and disturbance mapping [20], corn plant counting [22], and maize drought identification [23]. 

Therefore, it can be concluded that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the type of deep learning models used in the pipeline according to the provided context.
