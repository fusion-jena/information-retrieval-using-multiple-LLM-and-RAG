I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context mainly discusses a study related to bat species identification using statistical modeling and Bayesian approximation, with the R-code provided in supplement S1. However, it does not mention any deep learning pipeline or its code repository location on platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket.
