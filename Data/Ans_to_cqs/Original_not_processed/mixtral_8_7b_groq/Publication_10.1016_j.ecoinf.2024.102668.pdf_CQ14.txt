Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the optimization of hyperparameters of a model using techniques such as grid search or random search. The context focuses on audio signal processing for songbird detection, acoustic complexity index (ACI) for ecological monitoring, and the influence of recorders in sampling design. It does not mention any specific machine learning models or their hyperparameter tuning.

However, the context does discuss the use of high-pass filtering at 500 Hz and collecting 120 hours of audio recordings per site for ecological monitoring. These are examples of preprocessing steps and experimental design choices that can influence the performance of a model but are not directly related to hyperparameter optimization.

In summary, based on the provided context, there is no information about the optimization of hyperparameters of a model.
