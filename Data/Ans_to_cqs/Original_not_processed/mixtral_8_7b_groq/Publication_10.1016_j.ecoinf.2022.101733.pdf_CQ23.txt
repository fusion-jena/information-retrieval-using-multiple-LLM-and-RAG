Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, there are some indications of steps taken to ensure data quality and representativeness, which can contribute to the model's generalizability.

First, the distribution of samples for training and validation follows a 60%-40% ratio, which is a common approach to reserve a portion of the data for validation and avoid overfitting. Additionally, the samples were carefully checked, and no mis-collected samples were detected, implying a certain level of data quality assurance.

Second, the training data was created using methodological decisions that present tradeoffs in data quality (class representativeness) and quantity. This suggests an awareness of the importance of having a representative dataset for the model to learn from, which can improve its generalizability.

Third, the study used Sentinel-2 images with a revisit period of 5 days, acquiring 148 images in total and retaining 43 images after filtering cloudy scenes. This process might have contributed to a more diverse dataset, as it likely captured various conditions and changes in the observed area.

Lastly, the study used the Support Vector Machine (SVM) for feature selection and optimizing parameters, although it is not a deep learning model. The SVM model was applied for objective microstructure classification using a combination of morphological parameters and textural features for low carbon steels.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, there are indications of steps taken to ensure data quality and representativeness, which can contribute to the generalizability of a model. However, without more specific information, it is difficult to definitively answer the query.
