Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete for the image quality model. Commonly used criteria for determining training completion include validation loss plateau, convergence of model parameters, or achieving a pre-specified level of performance on a validation dataset. The "caret" R package, which is used to define the model performance metrics in Table 4, provides various methods for model training and evaluation, but it does not specify the stopping criteria for training in this context. The training process for the image quality model might involve one or more of these criteria, but the specific details are not provided in the given text.
