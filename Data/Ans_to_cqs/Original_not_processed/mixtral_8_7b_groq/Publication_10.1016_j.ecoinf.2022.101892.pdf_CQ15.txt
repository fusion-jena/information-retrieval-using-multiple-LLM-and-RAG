Answer:::

The specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the models were trained using PyTorch, a popular open-source machine learning library that provides various optimization algorithms.

Common optimization algorithms provided by PyTorch include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad, among others. The choice of optimization algorithm depends on the specific problem and the characteristics of the data.

In addition to the optimization algorithm, the context mentions other techniques used to accelerate the convergence of the model and prevent overfitting. These include pre-training the model on a large dataset (ImageNet), fine-tuning the pre-trained model on the specific dataset, and aggressive data augmentation.

Furthermore, the context mentions the use of a five-fold subject-exclusive cross-validation technique to eliminate the influence of individual subjects and ensure a fair evaluation of the model's performance.

To determine the most computationally efficient model, the context mentions measuring the maximum queries per second (QPS) achieved under real-world conditions by setting the batch size to 400 and testing all models under the same experiment setting and the same GPU.

Therefore, while the specific optimization technique is not mentioned, the context provides information on other techniques used to improve the performance and efficiency of the deep learning pipeline.
