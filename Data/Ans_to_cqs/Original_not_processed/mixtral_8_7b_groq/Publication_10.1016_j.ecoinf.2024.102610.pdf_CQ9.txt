Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The Keshavamurthy et al. (2022) paper provides a systematic review of machine learning and deep learning approaches for predicting infectious diseases, but it does not mention where the data or code for their review are stored.

However, the paper does mention several data sources used in the studies they reviewed, such as TerraClimate (Abatzoglou et al., 2018), Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data (Funk et al., 2015), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and WorldPop (<https://www.worldpop.org/>). It is possible that some of the studies they reviewed made their data and code available in these repositories.

Additionally, some of the papers mentioned in the context use R packages, such as the caret package (Khun, 2022) and the VSURF package (Forests, 2021), which may have their own code repositories. However, these packages do not seem to be directly related to the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context.

Therefore, without further information, it is not possible to determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
