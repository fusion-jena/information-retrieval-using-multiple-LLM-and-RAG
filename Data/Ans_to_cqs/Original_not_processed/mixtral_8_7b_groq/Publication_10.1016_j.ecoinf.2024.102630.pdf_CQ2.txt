Answer:::
The study mentioned in the context uses remote sensing data in the form of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for their deep learning pipeline. NDVI is a numerical indicator that measures the density of green vegetation and is derived from satellite or aerial images. Therefore, the data format used in this study is image-based, specifically NDVI images.

Three NDVI datasets are used in this study: the 16-day synthesized MOD13Q1 V6 NDVI dataset (MODIS NDVI), the daily NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) of AVHRR NDVI V5 dataset (CDR AVHRR NDVI), and the third generation GIMMS NDVI from AVHRR sensors dataset (GIMMS NDVI). These datasets are sourced from the Google Earth Engine platform, the Resource and Environmental Data Center, and NOAA Climate Data Record.

Additionally, the study uses NDVI data for different time periods, including annual mean NDVI data (January-December), growing season mean NDVI data (March-November), spring mean NDVI data (March-May), summer mean NDVI data (June-August), and winter mean NDVI data (September-November).

Therefore, the data format used in this study is image-based NDVI data, sourced from various providers and calculated for different time periods.
