Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in this study uses RGB photographs and bioclimatic data as inputs.

Firstly, the pipeline utilizes simple RGB photographs from the iNaturalist plant photograph database. These images are used to extract a set of plant functional traits through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The CNN models are trained on these RGB photographs to predict various plant functional traits.

Secondly, the pipeline incorporates bioclimatic data from the 'Worldclim' dataset. This data is fed into the CNN alongside the RGB photographs. The bioclimatic data includes information on temperature, precipitation, and their seasonality. The study confirms the benefit of including this climate information in predicting trait expressions for all traits.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in this study uses both image data (RGB photographs) and additional contextual data (bioclimatic data) as inputs. The CNN models are designed to adapt to these variable inputs from different scales and sensors, making them a promising tool for ecological research.
