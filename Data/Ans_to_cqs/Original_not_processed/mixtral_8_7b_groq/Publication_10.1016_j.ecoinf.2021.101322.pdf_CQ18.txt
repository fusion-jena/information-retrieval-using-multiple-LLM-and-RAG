Based on the context provided, there is no explicit mention of the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it is mentioned that the CNN models were used for classification and regression tasks in the results section, which implies that the performance of these models was evaluated in terms of their accuracy in making predictions.

Furthermore, the context suggests that the CNN models could benefit from additional input information, such as catch date, body length, back calculated smolt size, weight, sex, and river location. It is possible that the performance of the models was monitored by evaluating the impact of adding this auxiliary information on the model's accuracy.

Moreover, the context highlights that the number of training examples in infrequent age classes can be relatively small, leading to lower accuracy compared to more abundant age classes. Therefore, it is plausible that the performance of the models was monitored by tracking the accuracy of the model's predictions across different age classes.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training, it can be inferred that the CNN models' accuracy in making predictions for classification and regression tasks was evaluated. Additionally, the impact of adding auxiliary information and the accuracy of the model's predictions across different age classes were likely monitored to assess the performance of the models.
