Unfortunately, there is no information provided in the context about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context focuses on the methodology, validation, and application of fire risk mapping in a specific region of Turkey, using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices. It also discusses the potential use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images and various modeling techniques, such as artificial neural networks, deep learning, and logistic regression, to enhance the accuracy of fire risk maps.

However, there is no mention of where the code repository for the deep learning pipeline is available, if it exists. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
