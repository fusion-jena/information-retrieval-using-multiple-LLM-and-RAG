Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The articles focus on the analysis of above-ground biomass (AGB) estimation in agroforestry systems using remote sensing data and machine learning models such as RF, ANN, and SVM. However, there is no mention of the use of deep learning models or where the data repository for the deep learning pipeline might be found.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as the necessary information is not present in the given context. I would recommend checking the full articles or contacting the authors for more information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline used in their study.
