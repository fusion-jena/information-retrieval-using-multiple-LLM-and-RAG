Answer:::

The text provided does not give information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The text focuses on the data cleaning process and the criteria used to filter the occurrence data from GBIF and OBIS using bioregions. The data loss for each criterion is presented in Table A.1, which shows the number of records in each stage of the data cleaning process. However, there is no mention of how the final cleaned dataset was split for model training.
