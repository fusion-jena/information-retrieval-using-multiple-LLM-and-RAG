The provided pieces of context do not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, they do discuss some related concepts such as data augmentation, pseudo-labeling, and the use of different data resolutions.

Data augmentation is a technique used to increase the size of the training set by generating new samples from the existing data. This can help reduce overfitting and improve the model's performance. In the context of "Arazo et al., 2020," data augmentation is used to ensure the reliability of the validation and test sets.

Pseudo-labeling is a semi-supervised learning method where unlabeled data is assigned artificial labels based on the predictions of a model trained on a small labeled dataset. This can help reduce the impact of confirmation bias and improve the model's performance. In the context of "Asghar et al., 2020," spatial pseudo-labeling is used for semi-supervised facies classification.

The use of different data resolutions is an important consideration in ecological studies, where preprocessed environmental data at meter- or kilometer-level resolution is typically used to effectively model potential species distributions at broad scales. In the context of "Arino et al., 2012," the Global Land Cover Map for 2009 (GlobCover 2009) is provided, which is a land cover map at a spatial resolution of 300 meters.

Regarding the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, the context does not provide specific information. However, some possible techniques include:

* Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain criteria (e.g., class labels) and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to ensure that the training, validation, and test sets have similar distributions.
* Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of samples from the minority class to balance the class distribution.
* Undersampling: This technique involves decreasing the number of samples from the majority class to balance the class distribution.
* Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population.

Therefore, based on the provided context and general knowledge of data preprocessing techniques, it can be inferred that techniques such as data augmentation, pseudo-labeling, and the use of different data resolutions can help improve the model's performance and reduce data bias. However, specific techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection are not mentioned in the provided context.
