Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific preprocessing steps taken before training the deep learning (DL) model. However, it does mention that real LiDAR point clouds are segmented using a methodology outlined in Section 2.3 for validation and testing purposes. This implies that some preprocessing might have been done in this segmentation step.

The context also indicates that a few samples of real MS point clouds are segmented to create a ground truth, which is used to validate the classifications of a DL model trained with synthetic data. This suggests that the real MS point clouds were cleaned and processed to some extent to create the ground truth.

Furthermore, the context highlights the importance of data augmentation in DL model training for semantic classifications of real LiDAR point clouds. Data augmentation techniques like rotations, translations, and flipping are commonly used for preprocessing point cloud data.

In summary, while the context does not provide explicit details on the preprocessing steps, it can be inferred that some level of cleaning and segmentation was performed on the real MS point clouds. Additionally, data augmentation techniques were likely applied during the training phase of the DL model. However, specific preprocessing steps such as normalization or scaling are not mentioned in the provided context.
