Based on the given context, there is no explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The sources mainly focus on the methodologies, processes, and applications of the models in different ecological studies.

However, it can be inferred that the deep learning model was most likely trained using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or similar hardware accelerators. This is because GPUs are widely used in machine learning and deep learning applications due to their ability to perform parallel computations, which significantly speeds up the training process compared to using only CPUs.

In the context "Combining a deep learning model with an optimization algorithm to detect the dispersal of the early stages of spotted butterfish in northern Vietnam under global warming" (Do, ANT., & Tran, HD., 2023), it is mentioned that a deep learning model was used, but there is no information about the hardware resources used for training. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the researchers used the available computational resources at their disposal, which might have included GPUs or other hardware accelerators.

Answer:::
The provided context does not contain specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, based on common practice in deep learning, it can be inferred that Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or similar hardware accelerators were most likely used for training the model.
