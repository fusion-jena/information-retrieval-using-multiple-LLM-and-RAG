Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in the given context uses primarily image data. The input images are in RGB format, and they are manually labeled and divided into training, validation, and test sets. These images are then preprocessed by scaling down to a fixed size of 512 Ã— 512 pixels with normalization using self-adaptive image scaling. Additionally, data augmentation techniques such as scaling, panning, rotation, color transformation, and mosaic are employed to increase the number of training samples and improve model generalization ability.

Furthermore, the study uses pre-trained models such as vgg16 with RGB and NIR (Near-Infrared) information fusion. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV.

Therefore, the primary data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the context is the RGB image format.
