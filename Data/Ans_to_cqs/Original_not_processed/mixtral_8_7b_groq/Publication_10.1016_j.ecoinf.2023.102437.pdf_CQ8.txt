Answer:::

The provided context does not mention or give information about a code repository for a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses various machine learning models, including the Lasso model and Random Forest (RF) models, which are based on tree structures and have been used for ENSO (El Niño–Southern Oscillation) forecasting. However, it does not specify or provide a code repository for these models or any deep learning pipeline.

The context also mentions some studies that have applied machine learning techniques to different fields, such as predicting tropical cyclone frequency, El Niño prediction, and pine wilt disease occurrence. However, there is no information about the code repositories of these studies.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as it is not addressed in the given context.
