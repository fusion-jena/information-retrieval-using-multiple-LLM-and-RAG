Answer:::
The deep learning models for fish segmentation and classification are built using the TensorFlow framework. Specifically, for the segmentation task, the base model is obtained from TensorFlow Object Detection API, while for the classification task, the base implementation of TensorFlow is used. Additionally, a ResNet50V2 model pre-trained with the ImageNet dataset is chosen for fish classification, which is also implemented in TensorFlow. Therefore, both the segmentation and classification models are built using TensorFlow.
