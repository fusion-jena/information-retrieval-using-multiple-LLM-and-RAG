The text provided does not give a detailed description of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does provide some context about the training and evaluation of the model that can be used to infer some steps in the deployment process.

Answer:::
The model used in the study is a multilayer perceptron (MLP), which is a type of artificial neural network (ANN). The MLP models were trained using a regression task, and the training was done using hyperparameter tuning with a grid search. The data was divided into a training set (80% of the data) and a test set (20% of the data) to ensure that the models were trained on one portion of the data and tested on a separate, previously unseen portion. This allowed for the assessment of the models' ability to generalize to new, unseen data accurately.

After training the MLP models, the researchers computed SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values using the model-agnostic Kernel SHAP method to understand which features are most important in predicting the start and (height of the) peak of the greening season. SHAP values are a method for interpreting the output of machine learning models by quantifying the importance of each feature in making a specific prediction.

The text does not provide information on how the trained model was serialized or deployed on a platform. Model serialization is the process of converting a trained model into a format that can be stored and loaded again for later use. Platform selection refers to the choice of hardware or software environment where the model will be deployed for making predictions.

In summary, the text provides information on the training and evaluation of the MLP models, including hyperparameter tuning, data splitting, and feature importance analysis using SHAP values. However, it does not provide information on the model serialization or platform selection for deploying the trained model.
