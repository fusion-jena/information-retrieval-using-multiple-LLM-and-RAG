Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the specific dataset used in the deep learning pipeline for air quality prediction in Modena, an Italian city, is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that the dataset is pre-processed using a MinMaxScaler that transforms each feature by scaling it to a [0–1] range.

The dataset consists of past values of air quality parameters, such as NO and NO2, from two legal air quality (AQ) stations in Modena. These values have decreasing trends. The dataset is reshaped such that each observation consists of x rows and y columns, where x is the number of previous observations (temporal window) and y is the number of features.

The context also mentions that several configurations of the LSTM architecture were tested and compared, and the implemented solution of LSTM is a trade-off between reaching good performances and minimizing the dimension of the training data. The number of neurons in the hidden layer (y) is determined based on the number of samples in the training set, the number of input neurons, the number of output neurons, and a value of α between 5 and 10.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the dataset used in this deep learning pipeline is specific to the air quality data in Modena, and it is pre-processed and reshaped to fit the LSTM model. The dataset is not a standard dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet, which are commonly used for image recognition tasks.
