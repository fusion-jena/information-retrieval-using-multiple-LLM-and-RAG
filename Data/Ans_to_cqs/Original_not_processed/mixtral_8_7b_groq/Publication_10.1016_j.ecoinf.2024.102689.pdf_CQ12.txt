Answer:::

Based on the provided context, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are primarily used in the deep learning models for fish-related applications. 

In the 2021 study by Zhang et al., an underwater fish individual recognition method was developed using an improved YOLOv4 and FaceNet, which are both based on CNNs. 

Pattanayak et al. (2021) introduced CURATING, a multi-objective based pruning technique for CNNs, specifically for model compression in fish individual recognition. 

Moreover, Rauf et al. (2019) proposed a deep learning framework based on the CNN method for fish species recognition. The proposed CNN architecture comprises 32 deep layers, making it highly capable of extracting valuable and discriminative features from images. 

Lastly, the study by Spampinato et al. (2008) detected, tracked, and counted fish in low-quality underwater videos using a CNN-based method. 

Therefore, it can be concluded that CNNs are the most common type of deep learning model used in the mentioned fish-related applications.
