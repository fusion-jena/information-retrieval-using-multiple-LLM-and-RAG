Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the study does not explicitly mention using any of the standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the study uses a dataset compiled from online videos showcasing wild bird species. The videos were collected from various YouTube channels, and the dataset includes information such as the number of subscribers in the channel, thumbnail information, bird species that appeared, and the name(s) of the target place(s).

The thumbnail information was classified into six categories, including people, birds, objects, scenery, text, and food. Objects that were identified in the videos were either a camera or binoculars. Each thumbnail category was recorded as a separate column with a value of 0 or 1 in a separate column for each category.

The study performed various data analyses using R software version 4.1.2 with Boruta, lmerTest, car, MuMIn, and randomForest packages. However, the study does not mention any deep learning techniques or pipelines.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the study does not use any of the standard deep learning datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the study uses a custom-compiled dataset from online videos showcasing wild bird species.
