Based on the provided context, the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model for predicting air quality are not mentioned. However, it is common to use various evaluation metrics to assess the performance of machine learning models, including deep learning models. Some of these metrics for a classification problem are:

1. Accuracy: It is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples.
  
2. Precision: It is the ratio of true positive predictions (relevant items that are correctly identified) to the sum of true positives and false positives (irrelevant items incorrectly identified as relevant).

3. Recall (Sensitivity): It is the ratio of true positive predictions to the sum of true positives and false negatives (relevant items incorrectly identified as irrelevant).

4. F1-score: It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that encapsulates both.

5. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): It is the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values.

6. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): It is the square root of the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.

7. RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination): It is the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

Given the context, it can be inferred that the deep learning models used for predicting air quality are likely evaluated using one or more of these metrics. However, the specific metrics are not provided in the context.
