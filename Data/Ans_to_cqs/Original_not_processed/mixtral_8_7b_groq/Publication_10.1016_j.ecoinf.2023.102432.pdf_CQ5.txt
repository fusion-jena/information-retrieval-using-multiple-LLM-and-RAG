Answer:::

The provided context does not mention any specific datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. Instead, it discusses the use of remote sensing data for the detection of invasive plant species using a multiple-instance learning algorithm.

The datasets used in this study include multispectral airborne and satellite imagery of the Everglades National Park, specifically NAIP, RapidEye, and Landsat 8 imagery. These datasets are used to train and test a multiple-instance learning algorithm for the detection of Brazilian peppertree, a highly problematic invasive plant species.

The multiple-instance learning algorithm used in this study is different from traditional deep learning pipelines, which typically use large labeled datasets for supervised learning. In contrast, multiple-instance learning allows for variability or imprecision in the training dataset, making it more suitable for remote sensing data where training labels may be noisy or inexact.

The study also mentions the use of MATLAB's TreeBagger function to complete the classification using 100 trees, but this is not a dataset, but rather a machine learning algorithm implemented in MATLAB.

Therefore, the datasets used in this study are multispectral airborne and satellite imagery of the Everglades National Park, specifically NAIP, RapidEye, and Landsat 8 imagery.
