The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model for tree species prediction involved model serialization and platform selection. Firstly, the VGG16 network was trained for 140,000 iterations and achieved the best performance among the three deep learning algorithms. The trained VGG16 network was then employed as the classification model for tree species prediction. All the clipped image patches of individual trees in the three areas were fed into the trained VGG16 network for classification. The results were obtained, and the tree species distribution across the three areas is shown in Table 3.

After training the model, the next step was to serialize the model. Model serialization is the process of saving the model architecture and weights to a file, which can be used later for making predictions. In this study, the trained VGG16 network was saved as a JSON file, which contained the model architecture, and a h5 file, which contained the model weights.

The serialized model was then deployed on a platform for making predictions. The platform selection depends on the requirements of the application. In this study, the serialized model was deployed on a local machine for making predictions on the test dataset. The model was loaded from the saved files, and the test dataset was passed through the model to obtain the predictions.

Therefore, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model for tree species prediction involved training the VGG16 network for 140,000 iterations, serializing the trained model by saving the architecture and weights to JSON and h5 files, and deploying the serialized model on a local machine for making predictions on the test dataset.
