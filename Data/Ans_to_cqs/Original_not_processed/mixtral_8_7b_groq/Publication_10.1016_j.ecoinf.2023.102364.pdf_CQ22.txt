The provided article does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model for predicting Short-billed Gull Larus canus presence. Instead, it discusses the use of a machine learning ensemble that includes RandomForest, Treenet, CART, and MARS algorithms. However, I will provide an answer based on the general practice of evaluating model performance.

Answer:::
The performance of the machine learning ensemble model was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, both internally and externally. Internally, the ROC curves for each individual algorithm ranged between 75% and 85%. The average ROC value across the ensemble was 71%. Externally, the 2013 Presence/Absence data cube was mapped onto the rasterized heatmap, allowing for a visual assessment of actual presence/absence data points compared to predicted RIO scores. This visual alignment indicated a robust, moderate-high model performance.

It is important to note that the provided context does not mention any specific evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall for the machine learning ensemble model. These metrics are commonly used to assess the performance of classification models, and it is possible that they were used in the evaluation process. However, based on the given information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer regarding the use of these metrics for the machine learning ensemble model.
