The provided context does not contain information about any deep learning model. Instead, it discusses a hidden Markov model (HMM) used for classifying blue whale vocalizations and noise. Therefore, I cannot provide the hyperparameters for a deep learning model because none is mentioned in the context.

However, I can summarize the HMM and its training process for you. The HMM has 8 states and 4 mixture weights. It combines two independently trained HMMs, HMM1 and HMM2, where the first 4 states represent HMM1 (blue whale vocalizations) and the last 4 states represent HMM2 (noise signal).

The HMM's emission distribution parameters, B, consist of the mean (μ), covariance matrix (Σ), and mixture weight (σ). These parameters are obtained using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, with the Baum-Welch algorithm being a typical example. The B parameters are initialized with a combination of the k-means clustering algorithm and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).

The HMM training algorithm's convergence can be significantly impacted by the initial value of the B parameters. To evaluate the model's performance, the context compares the performance of the HMM across different recording months and dataset sizes. The most suitable dataset size range for achieving high accuracy is found to be between 8 to 20 hours for both months.

In summary, the provided context discusses an HMM used for classifying blue whale vocalizations and noise, along with its training process. However, it does not contain information about any deep learning model.
