Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link for it. The context discusses a study that used ecological niche modeling (iSDMs) to predict the distribution of species based on presence records and environmental data. The models were evaluated using various metrics, and five treatments were applied to test the impact of potential biases and errors. However, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link for it. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
