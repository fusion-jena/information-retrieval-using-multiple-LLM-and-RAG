Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a deep learning model such as an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) or MaxNet. However, it does discuss the use of various machine learning algorithms for ecological niche modeling, including XGBOOST, GLM, GAM, SER, FDA, GBM, RF, MaxEnt, and MARS.

Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer regarding the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model for this particular context. In general, hyperparameters for deep learning models can include learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons per layer, activation functions, regularization techniques, batch size, and number of epochs. The choice of hyperparameters depends on the specific deep learning model and the dataset being used.

It is worth noting that the context discusses the use of XGBOOST, which is a gradient boosting algorithm that can be used for both shallow and deep models. For XGBOOST, some common hyperparameters include learning rate, maximum depth of trees, subsample ratio, column sample ratio, regularization parameters, and early stopping rounds. The Chen et al. (2015) reference provided in the context may contain more information on the specific hyperparameters used for XGBOOST in this case.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model, it does discuss various machine learning algorithms and their hyperparameters. If a deep learning model was used, common hyperparameters include learning rate, optimizer, number of layers, number of neurons per layer, activation functions, regularization techniques, batch size, and number of epochs. However, the specific hyperparameters used would depend on the deep learning model and dataset being used.
