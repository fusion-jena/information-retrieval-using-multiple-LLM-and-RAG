Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it is mentioned that the workflow includes pre-processing of images, which suggests that some preprocessing techniques may have been applied.

Common techniques used to address data bias include stratified sampling, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection. Stratified sampling involves dividing the data into subgroups or "strata" based on certain characteristics, such as class labels, and then randomly sampling from each stratum to ensure that each subset is proportionally represented in the training set. Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class, while undersampling involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class. Diverse data collection involves gathering data from a variety of sources to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population.

In the context provided, it is mentioned that image augmentation techniques were used, including random rotation, width and height shift range, shear range, zoom range, scalar range, horizontal flip, and fill mode with the nearest pixel. While these techniques can help improve the model's performance by increasing the size and diversity of the training set, they do not directly address data bias.

Therefore, while the context provides some information about the preprocessing techniques used, it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias.
