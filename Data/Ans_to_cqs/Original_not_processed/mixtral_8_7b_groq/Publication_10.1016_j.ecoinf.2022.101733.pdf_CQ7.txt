Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for training a deep learning model are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it does mention that the data is split into training and validation samples according to a 60%-40% ratio. This implies that a portion of the data, around 60%, is used for training the model, while the remaining 40% is used for validation.

The validation samples are used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model during the training process. This is important because it helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to the training data. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, to the point where it performs poorly on new, unseen data. By using a separate validation set, the model's performance can be monitored and adjustments can be made to prevent overfitting.

In addition, the context also states that the sample's class proportions are typical of the landscape's real class proportions. This suggests that the data is stratified, meaning that the samples are divided into subsets based on their class labels. Stratified sampling helps to ensure that each class is represented proportionally in both the training and validation sets. This can be particularly important in remote sensing image classification, where the classes of interest may be imbalanced.

It's also worth noting that the data is split after carefully checking the samples for mis-collections. This step is crucial to ensure the quality of the data and the reliability of the results.

In summary, while the specific criteria for splitting the data into training and validation sets is not provided, the context does suggest that the data is split according to a 60%-40% ratio, with stratified sampling used to ensure class proportions are typical of the landscape. The validation set is used to monitor the model's performance during training and prevent overfitting.
