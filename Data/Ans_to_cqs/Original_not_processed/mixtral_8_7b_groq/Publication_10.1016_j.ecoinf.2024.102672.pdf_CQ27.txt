The provided context does not give detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that a classification model was designed and trained using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) with specific hyperparameters. It also mentions that the Adam algorithm, a stochastic gradient descent method, was used as an optimizer during the training.

Based on common practices in deep learning model deployment, we can infer some possible steps that might have been taken after training the model.

First, the model would likely have been saved to a file using model serialization techniques. Model serialization involves saving the model's architecture, weights, and other relevant information to a file, allowing the model to be easily loaded and used later without needing to retrain it. Common model serialization formats include JSON, XML, and protocol buffers.

Once the model is serialized, it can be deployed to a platform for use in applications. The choice of platform would depend on the specific use case and requirements. Some possible deployment platforms include:

1. Local servers or workstations: The trained model can be deployed on local servers or workstations for use in web applications, desktop applications, or other local systems.
2. Cloud platforms: Cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provide scalable infrastructure for deploying and running deep learning models. These platforms offer services like machine learning as a service (MLaaS), which simplifies the deployment and management of machine learning models.
3. Edge devices: For applications requiring real-time predictions, deep learning models can be deployed on edge devices like smartphones, IoT devices, or embedded systems.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly describe the process used to deploy the trained deep learning model, it is likely that the model was serialized and deployed to a platform for use in applications. Common deployment platforms include local servers, cloud platforms, and edge devices.
