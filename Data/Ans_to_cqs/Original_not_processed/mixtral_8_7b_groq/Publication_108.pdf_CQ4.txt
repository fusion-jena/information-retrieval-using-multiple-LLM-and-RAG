Answer:

 The text provided does not give specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that an investigation of the performance of the proposed architecture on further datasets, including the use of different data augmentation techniques, would be an interesting future project. This suggests that the authors were aware of the potential benefits of data augmentation, such as increasing the power of generalization, but did not apply any in this particular study.

 Data augmentation techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotating, and scaling. Flipping involves creating new instances by horizontally or vertically flipping the original images. Rotating involves creating new instances by rotating the original images by a certain angle. Scaling involves creating new instances by changing the scale of the original images, either uniformly or non-uniformly. These techniques can help increase the size and diversity of the training set, which can improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

 Other data augmentation techniques that can be used include cropping, brightness and contrast adjustment, and adding noise. Cropping involves creating new instances by removing a portion of the original images. Brightness and contrast adjustment involves creating new instances by adjusting the brightness and contrast of the original images. Adding noise involves creating new instances by adding different types of noise, such as Gaussian noise or salt and pepper noise, to the original images.

 In summary, while the text provided does not give specific information about the data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest that the authors were aware of the potential benefits of data augmentation. Common data augmentation techniques include flipping, rotating, and scaling, as well as cropping, brightness and contrast adjustment, and adding noise.
