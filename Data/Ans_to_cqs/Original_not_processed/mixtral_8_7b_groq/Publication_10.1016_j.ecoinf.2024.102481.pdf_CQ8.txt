Answer:::

The provided context does not mention or give information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. There is no mention of GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repositories in the text. The authors also do not provide a specific methodology for the machine learning techniques used, only stating that Random Forests (RF) analyses were used and proved to be effective in classifying maturity in Chilean hake. Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the code repository for this study.
