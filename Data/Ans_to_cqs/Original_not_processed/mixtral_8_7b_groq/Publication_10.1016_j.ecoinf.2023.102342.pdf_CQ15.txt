The provided context does not directly mention the optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam. However, it does discuss the optimization and elaboration step in the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, which involves applying data processing techniques to verify or interpret results.

In the context provided, the optimization and elaboration step includes the application of the Apriori algorithm, which is a data mining technique used to identify the most frequent itemsets in a given database. The Apriori algorithm performs joining and pruning processes iteratively to locate the most frequent itemsets. Joining represents the union of itemsets, while pruning is a data compression technique that reduces the size of decision trees by removing non-critical and redundant sections, thereby improving predictive accuracy and reducing overfitting.

Although the provided context does not explicitly mention SGD or Adam, optimization techniques like these are crucial in deep learning pipelines. SGD is a first-order optimization algorithm commonly used to train deep learning models by minimizing the loss function. Adam, on the other hand, is an adaptive optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of SGD and other optimization algorithms like Adagrad and RMSProp.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly answer the query, optimization techniques like SGD and Adam are essential in deep learning pipelines for training models and minimizing loss functions.
