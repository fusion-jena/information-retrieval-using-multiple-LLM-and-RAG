Based on the provided context, there are no specific details mentioned regarding the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model for any of the studies. However, it is general practice in deep learning to perform several preprocessing steps on the data before training a model. These steps can include:

1. Normalization: This involves scaling the data to a range of [0,1] or mean = 0, standard deviation = 1. This helps to improve the training process by making the optimization algorithm converge faster and perform better.
2. Scaling: This involves resizing the input data to a specific dimension. This is particularly important in computer vision tasks where the images need to be resized to a specific dimension before being fed into the model.
3. Cleaning: This involves removing any noise or outliers from the data. This can help to improve the accuracy of the model by reducing the amount of irrelevant information in the data.

Therefore, while the specific preprocessing steps are not mentioned in the provided context, it is reasonable to assume that these steps were performed before training the deep learning models in these studies.
