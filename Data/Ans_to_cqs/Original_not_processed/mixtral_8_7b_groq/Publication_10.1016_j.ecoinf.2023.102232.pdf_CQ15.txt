Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of optimization techniques in a different context than deep learning pipelines. Instead, it describes the application of the Least Squares (LS) method and Genetic Algorithms (GA) in an ecological study. Therefore, I cannot directly answer the query regarding optimization techniques in deep learning pipelines, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.

However, I can provide some information about optimization techniques that are commonly used in deep learning pipelines:

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): An optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function in deep learning. SGD iteratively updates the model parameters by computing gradients on a single training example or a small batch of examples at a time.
2. Momentum: An optimization technique used to improve the convergence of SGD by incorporating the past gradients' direction. This helps to overcome local minima and accelerate learning.
3. Adagrad: An optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each parameter. It rescales the gradients based on the historical gradient information, which is helpful for handling sparse data.
4. Adadelta: An extension of Adagrad that maintains a moving window of the historical gradient information, reducing the aggressive learning rate adjustments seen in Adagrad.
5. Adam: A popular optimization algorithm that combines the ideas from Adagrad and Momentum. It computes adaptive learning rates for each parameter by using estimates of the first and second moments of the gradients.

These optimization techniques are used to train deep learning models by minimizing the loss function and finding the optimal set of model parameters. The choice of optimization technique depends on the specific problem, dataset, and model architecture.
