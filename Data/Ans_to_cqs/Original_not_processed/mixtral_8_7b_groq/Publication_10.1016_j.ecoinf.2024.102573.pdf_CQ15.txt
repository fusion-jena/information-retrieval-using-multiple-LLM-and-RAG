Answer:::

The optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline for training the bird species recognition models is the Adam optimizer (Kingma and Ba, 2017). The Adam optimizer is a popular choice in deep learning due to its efficiency and effectiveness. It is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of both AdaGrad and RMSProp. Adam adjusts the learning rate for each parameter individually, enabling faster convergence and better model performance.

In the given context, the Adam optimizer is utilized with the default hyper-parameters and a cosine decay scheduler for the learning rate. The cosine decay scheduler gradually decreases the learning rate following a cosine function, allowing for a more stable training process and potentially better generalization.

The loss function employed for training these models is cross-entropy, which is a common choice for multi-class single-label classification tasks. Cross-entropy measures the difference between the predicted probabilities and the true labels, encouraging the model to produce accurate probability estimates for each class.

Moreover, the macro-averaged F1-score on the validation set is used for monitoring the model convergence. Macro-averaging calculates the F1-score for each class independently and then takes the average, giving equal importance to all classes regardless of the number of data points in each one. This approach is beneficial in imbalanced datasets, where some classes may have significantly fewer samples than others.

In summary, the Adam optimizer with a cosine decay scheduler and cross-entropy loss function is used for training bird species recognition models. The macro-averaged F1-score on the validation set is employed for monitoring the model convergence during the training process.
