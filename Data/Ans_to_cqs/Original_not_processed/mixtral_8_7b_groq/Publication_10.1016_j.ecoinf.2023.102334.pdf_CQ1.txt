Answer:::

The provided context does not directly discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the application of deep learning and Transformer in the field of facial recognition of sika deer.

In general, deep learning pipelines for computer vision tasks like facial recognition can use various methods to collect raw data. Surveys and sensors are two possible methods, although they are not explicitly mentioned in the context. Surveys can be used to collect images or videos of the subjects of interest, either through manual collection or automated data collection systems. Sensors, particularly cameras, can be used to continuously monitor and collect data from the environment.

Public datasets are another common source of raw data for deep learning pipelines. These datasets can be used to train and test computer vision models, and they are often publicly available for researchers and developers to use. For example, in the context of facial recognition, there are several public datasets available, such as the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset and the Yale Face Database.

In the specific case of the sika deer facial recognition system described in the context, it is unclear how the raw data was collected. However, it is mentioned that the system was developed using deep learning and Transformer techniques, and that it was trained on a dataset of sika deer faces. The system achieved high accuracy in recognizing sika deer faces, demonstrating the potential of deep learning and Transformer techniques for facial recognition tasks.
