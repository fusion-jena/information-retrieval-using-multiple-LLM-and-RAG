Answer:::

The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context provided is not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that the training process might be complete when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly.

In the data collection and curation phases, the images are divided into patches for training and validation. During training, square patches of various sizes are randomly cropped and augmented, while during validation, the images are divided into regularly spaced, overlapping patches. The predictions from these patches are then combined to calculate metrics over the complete image.

The training phase involves using ground-truth derived from dot labels, which are transformed into bounding boxes, density maps, or segmentation maps based on the specific deep learning model being employed. The parameters used for these transformations, such as the side length of the bounding boxes or the radius of the segmentation maps, are determined based on standard object sizes prevalent in the images.

Therefore, it can be assumed that the training process continues until the validation loss, which is calculated using counting metrics on a non-publicly available dataset, no longer decreases or decreases only marginally. This is a common practice in machine learning, as it indicates that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data and is not overfitting. However, it is important to note that this is an inference based on the provided context, and the exact criteria used to determine training completion are not specified.
