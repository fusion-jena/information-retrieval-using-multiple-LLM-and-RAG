Answer:::

The provided context discusses the text preprocessing steps and model training of the ERNIE model, but it does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps taken after training the model. However, based on common practices in machine learning, we can infer some possible postprocessing steps.

After training a model like ERNIE, some typical postprocessing steps include:

1. Model evaluation metrics calculation: This step involves calculating various metrics to assess the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and perplexity. These metrics can help researchers understand how well the model is performing concerning the given task.

2. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It can be used to compute various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall. A confusion matrix shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

3. Saliency maps: Saliency maps are a way to visualize the importance of input features concerning the model's output. In the context of text classification, saliency maps can highlight which words or phrases in a given text contribute the most to the model's prediction. However, creating saliency maps for transformer-based models like ERNIE can be challenging due to their complex architecture.

4. Model interpretation techniques: Other model interpretation techniques can be used to gain insights into how the model is making predictions. For example, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values can be calculated to understand the contribution of each feature to the model's prediction.

It is important to note that the provided context does not explicitly mention any of these postprocessing steps. Therefore, the answer is based on common practices in machine learning and not on information provided in the context.
