Answer:::

The provided context does not mention any deep learning models. Instead, it discusses a machine learning model based on covariance-weighted bagging and a geostatistical model using sequential simulation and local kriging. Therefore, I cannot provide information on the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model as it was not mentioned in the context.
