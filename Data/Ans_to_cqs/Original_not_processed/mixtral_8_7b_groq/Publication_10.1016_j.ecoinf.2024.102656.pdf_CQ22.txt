The provided context does not explicitly mention the performance metrics used for a deep learning model. However, it does describe the evaluation of other models using the area under the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS). Therefore, these two metrics can be confirmed as being used for model evaluation.

The area under the curve (AUC) is a common metric for evaluating the performance of predictive models. It ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better model performance. An AUC value exceeding 0.9 is considered excellent, 0.9-0.8 as good, 0.8-0.7 as moderate, and below 0.7 as poor.

The true skill statistic (TSS) is another evaluation metric that categorizes model performance as excellent (>0.75), good (0.75 to 0.4), and poor (<0.4). TSS is a threshold-dependent measure that combines the sensitivity and specificity of a model into a single metric.

However, the context does not mention the use of accuracy, precision, or recall for evaluating the models. These are other common metrics for assessing the performance of predictive models, particularly in classification tasks. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made, precision calculates the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions, and recall determines the proportion of true positives among all actual positives in the data.

In summary, the context indicates that the area under the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS) are used for evaluating the models. Deep learning model-specific metrics, such as accuracy, precision, and recall, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
