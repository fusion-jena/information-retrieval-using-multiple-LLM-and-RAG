Based on the provided context, there is no information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several papers and resources related to deep learning, CUDA programming, and particle Markov-chain Monte Carlo for disease dynamics modeling. However, none of these sources mention or provide a link to a data repository for a deep learning pipeline.

The context does mention various tools and platforms used for deep learning, such as LibBi, the Deep Learning Toolbox by MathWorks, cuDNN, and Darknet. It also describes how to create a CUDA-capable Virtual-Machine (VM) instance on Google Cloud for deep learning purposes. However, these sources do not mention any data repository for a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the data repository for the deep learning pipeline is not available or mentioned.
