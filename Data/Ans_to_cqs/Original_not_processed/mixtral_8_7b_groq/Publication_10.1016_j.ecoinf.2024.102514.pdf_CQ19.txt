Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of the frameworks used to build the deep learning models. The context discusses various studies that use machine learning and deep learning techniques for water quality assessment and waste disposal rate estimation. However, it does not specify the particular frameworks used to build these models.

Commonly used frameworks for building deep learning models include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Theano. TensorFlow is a popular open-source library developed by Google Brain Team, while PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. Keras is a high-level neural networks API that runs on top of TensorFlow, Theano, and others, while Theano is a Python library for fast numerical computations.

In the study titled "Assessing water quality of an ecologically critical urban canal incorporating machine learning approaches," the authors used a recurrent neural network model for waste disposal rate estimation. However, the specific framework used to build this model is not mentioned. Similarly, in the study titled "Application of VNIR and machine learning technologies to predict heavy metals in soil and pollution indices in mining areas," the authors used machine learning techniques but did not specify the framework used.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning models.
