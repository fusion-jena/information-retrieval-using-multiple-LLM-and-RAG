Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the researchers used camera traps or similar devices to collect video data of animals, as they evaluated the tracking performance on various video clips. Camera traps are commonly used in wildlife research to collect images and videos of animals in their natural habitats.

Additionally, the researchers mentioned the use of public datasets in their references. For instance, they cited a paper by Babenko et al. (2011) that used the PASCAL Visual Object Classes (VOC) challenge dataset for object tracking. The PASCAL VOC dataset is a public dataset used for various computer vision tasks, including object detection and tracking.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data, it can be inferred that the researchers used camera traps for video data and possibly utilized public datasets for other parts of their deep learning pipeline.
