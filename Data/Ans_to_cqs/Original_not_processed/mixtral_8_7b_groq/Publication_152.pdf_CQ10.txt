Answer:::

The provided pieces of context do not include information about the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context focuses on the use of deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and U-Net, for various applications such as counting corn plants, quantifying citrus trees, and identifying eucalyptus trees. It also mentions the use of a DJI Phantom 2 drone for data gathering. However, there is no information about the code repository or the specific tools and libraries used in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific link to the code repository.
