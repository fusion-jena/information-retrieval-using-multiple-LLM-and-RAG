Based on the provided context, there are no specific details mentioned about postprocessing steps involved immediately after the model training process. The text mainly focuses on the computing resources, model training, and results of the transfer learning tasks.

However, we can infer some possible postprocessing steps from the information given in the 'Results' section.

1. Metrics calculation: The 'Results' section mentions the accuracies of transfer learning models on the test set. This implies that the models' performances were evaluated using accuracy as a metric. There might have been other metrics calculated as well, such as precision, recall, F1-score, or area under the ROC curve, but it is not explicitly stated in the context.

2. Confusion matrix: Although not explicitly mentioned, the calculation of a confusion matrix can be inferred from the description of the binomial test. The binomial test is used to compare the performance of different transfer strategies. To perform this test, a confusion matrix would be required to calculate the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each class.

As for saliency maps, there is no information in the context that suggests this method was used in the postprocessing steps. Saliency maps are typically used to visualize the parts of the input data that the model focuses on for making predictions. The context provided does not mention any visualization techniques or interpretation of the model's decision-making process.

In summary, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training likely include metrics calculation, such as accuracy, and possibly the calculation of a confusion matrix. However, there is no information suggesting the use of saliency maps in this particular study.
