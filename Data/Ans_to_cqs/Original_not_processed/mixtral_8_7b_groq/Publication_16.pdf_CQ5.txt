Answer:::
The specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the study uses a limited range of species for bird classification. The future work aims to significantly expand the number of classes in the model by including additional data. This implies that the dataset used in this study is likely a collection of bird species audio and visual data, possibly including spectrogram representations of bird sounds.

References to other studies in the literature suggest that datasets such as BirdCLEF2017, which provides visual spectrogram representations of bird sounds, have been used for bird classification tasks using deep learning approaches. Another study mentioned used a combination of hand-crafted features, visual features, and deep learning features to classify fourteen different bird species using three different feature types.

Therefore, while the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that the dataset used is a collection of bird species audio and visual data, potentially including spectrogram representations of bird sounds.
