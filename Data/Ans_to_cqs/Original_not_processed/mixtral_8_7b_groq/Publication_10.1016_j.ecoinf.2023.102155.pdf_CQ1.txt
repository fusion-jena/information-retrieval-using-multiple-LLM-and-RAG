The provided context does not directly answer the query regarding the methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines. However, it does contain information about various deep learning techniques, evaluation metrics, and a study by E. Guilbault et al.

Answer: Based on the given context, it is not possible to explicitly list the methods for raw data collection in deep learning pipelines. Common methods for data collection include surveys, sensors, and public datasets, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. Instead, the context focuses on bias correction, mean RSS, NIMSE, and various deep learning techniques such as individual, k-nearest neighbors (knn), means, random-CFLoop, A-Loop, T-Loop, lasso, and no bias correction methods. These techniques are likely applied to existing datasets rather than discussing the data collection methods.
