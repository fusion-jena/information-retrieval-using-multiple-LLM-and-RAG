The text provided does not give explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some types of data and sources that are used in the analysis.

The study focuses on the family Orchidaceae, and it is likely that the raw data used in the analysis consists of occurrence records for orchid species. These occurrence records could come from various sources, such as herbarium specimens, field surveys, and citizen science projects. The paper by Rivers et al. (2011) mentioned in the bibliography discusses the use of herbarium specimens for detecting threatened species, which suggests that herbarium specimens may be one source of data used in this study.

Additionally, the study uses data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF), which is a publicly available database of biodiversity data. GBIF aggregates data from various sources, including museums, herbaria, and individual researchers, and provides access to this data through a single interface. The paper by Zizka et al. (2020c) mentioned in the bibliography discusses some of the challenges of using GBIF data, including issues with data quality and sampling bias.

The study also uses the IUCN Red List, which is a database of threatened species maintained by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The IUCN Red List provides information on the conservation status of species, as well as data on their distribution and population trends. The paper by Pfab et al. (2011) mentioned in the bibliography discusses the use of the IUCN Red List for setting species targets for conservation planning.

Overall, while the text does not provide explicit information about the methods used for collecting raw data, it suggests that the data used in the analysis comes from a variety of sources, including herbarium specimens, field surveys, citizen science projects, and publicly available databases.
