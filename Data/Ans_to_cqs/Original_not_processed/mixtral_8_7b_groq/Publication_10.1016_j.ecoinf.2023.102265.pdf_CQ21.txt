Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention that they used Support Vector Machine (SVM) as their classifier model and performed 5-fold cross-validation during the training and validation stage.

Given that they used SVM, common postprocessing steps after training an SVM classifier could include:

1. Calculating metrics: After obtaining the predictions from the SVM classifier, one can calculate various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the model.
2. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is a table that is often used to describe the performance of a classification model. It can be used to calculate the above-mentioned metrics.
3. Visualization: Visualization techniques like saliency maps can be used to gain insights into the model's decision-making process. However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of saliency maps.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of a software classifier based on ResNet-50, which generates a feature vector of size 1000. This feature vector is then used to train the SVM classifier. However, the postprocessing steps after training the SVM classifier are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training could include calculating metrics, generating a confusion matrix, and visualization using techniques like saliency maps. However, the context does not explicitly mention these steps.
