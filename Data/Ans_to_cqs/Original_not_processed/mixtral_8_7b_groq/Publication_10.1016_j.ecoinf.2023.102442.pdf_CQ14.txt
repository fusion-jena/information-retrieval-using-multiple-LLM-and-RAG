Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model, such as the buffer distance in step 8 or the proximity distance in step 19, are optimized. The text does not mention any specific techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization methods.

However, it can be inferred that the hyperparameters are likely to be determined through a process of trial and error, where different values are tested and the results are evaluated to determine the best value. For example, in step 8, the buffer distance ranges between 100 and 900 m, suggesting that different distances were tried and the most suitable one was chosen. Similarly, in step 19, the proximity distance is set to 150 m after testing showed that it produced the best results, with distances less than 200 m being generally more effective.

Therefore, while the specific optimization method is not mentioned, it is likely that the hyperparameters are optimized through a process of manual tuning and evaluation of the results.
