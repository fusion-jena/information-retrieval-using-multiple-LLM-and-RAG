Answer: Based on the information provided, the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is audio. More specifically, the input data consists of flight call recordings used for environmental sound classification. These recordings are modified and augmented using various audio deformations, such as adding background noise, applying dynamic range compression, pitch shifting, and time stretching. The MUDA library is used for the implementation of these audio deformations.
