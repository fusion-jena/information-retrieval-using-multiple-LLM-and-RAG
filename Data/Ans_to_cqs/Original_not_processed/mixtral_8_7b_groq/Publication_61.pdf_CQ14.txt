Based on the provided context, the hyperparameters of the model are not explicitly stated to have been optimized using a specific method such as grid search or random search. However, it is mentioned that the learning rate is a special hyperparameter that is trained using the Adam optimizer, a variant of stochastic gradient optimization where the learning rate is adjusted automatically. The other hyperparameters, including the number of epochs and batch size, are set empirically.

It is worth noting that hyperparameter tuning is an important step in training neural networks, as the choice of hyperparameters can greatly affect the performance of the model. Grid search and random search are two common methods for hyperparameter tuning. Grid search involves creating a grid of possible hyperparameter values and training the model with each combination, while random search involves randomly sampling hyperparameter values from a given distribution. Other methods for hyperparameter tuning include Bayesian optimization and gradient-based optimization.

In summary, while the provided context does not specify the method used for hyperparameter optimization, it does mention that the learning rate is adjusted automatically using the Adam optimizer, and the other hyperparameters are set empirically. Hyperparameter tuning is an important step in training neural networks, and methods such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, and gradient-based optimization can be used for this purpose.
