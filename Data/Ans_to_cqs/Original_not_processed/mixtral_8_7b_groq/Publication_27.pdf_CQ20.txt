Based on the provided context, the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model are not explicitly mentioned. However, there are several indications that powerful computational devices, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), were likely employed during the training process.

First, the document is downloaded from IEEE Xplore, a platform that often hosts research papers related to machine learning and artificial intelligence. These fields typically require substantial computational power for model training.

Second, the presence of various IEEE conference codes, such as ICASSP, ICIP, and IJCNN, suggests that this is a research paper or a technical report. These conferences focus on signal processing, image processing, and neural networks, all of which involve deep learning model training.

Third, the context contains numerous citations to other research papers that discuss deep learning model training and optimization, implying that the authors are engaged in similar work.

Lastly, the context includes several technical terms related to deep learning, such as "convolutional neural network" (CNN), "recurrent neural network" (RNN), "long short-term memory" (LSTM), and "gated recurrent unit" (GRU). These terms indicate that the context is related to deep learning model training, which typically requires high-performance hardware resources like GPUs or TPUs.

In conclusion, while the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model are not explicitly stated in the provided context, there are strong indications that GPUs or TPUs were used due to the nature of the document, the technical terms used, and the focus on deep learning model training and optimization.
