The provided context does not offer specific details about the type of deep learning model used in the study or its particular purpose such as classification, segmentation, or detection. However, it does mention that deep learning algorithms, including Deep Neural Networks, were employed for predictive modeling in the context of oil palm yield.

In general, deep learning models can be used for various tasks in image processing and natural language processing, among others. In the context of image data, deep learning models can be used for classification (categorizing images into different classes), segmentation (partitioning images into multiple meaningful regions), object detection (identifying and locating objects within images), and other tasks.

Given that the study focuses on yield prediction, it is plausible that the deep learning model was used for regression (predicting a continuous output variable) rather than the aforementioned image-based tasks. However, without more specific information from the text, it is not possible to definitively answer this question.
