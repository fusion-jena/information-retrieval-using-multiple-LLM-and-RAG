Answer:

The deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context uses two specific datasets, namely ECUHO-1 and ECUHO-2. These datasets are used for the detection of Halophila ovalis, a species of seagrass, which is important for marine ecosystems.

The first dataset, ECUHO-1, and the second dataset, ECUHO-2, were used in a study where a detector based on Faster R-CNN with the NASNet model was proposed. This study achieved the highest mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.291 and 0.412 on the ECUHO-1 and ECUHO-2 datasets, respectively.

In another study, a detector-2 based on EfficientDet-B7 was proposed, and this study used the same ECUHO-1 and ECUHO-2 datasets. The researchers used the TensorFlow object detection API and downloaded the pre-trained EfficientDet-D7 model weight from the TensorFlow-2 object detection model zoo page. They set up the model config file with a class number 1, image size of 1536 Ã— 1536, batch size of 16, initial learning rate of 2e3, momentum optimizer value of 0.5, and step number of 400,000. They also monitored the validation loss using early stopping during training for every epoch and consciously monitored the validation accuracy to stop overfitting and overtraining with a patience of 20.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context uses the ECUHO-1 and ECUHO-2 datasets for the detection of Halophila ovalis.
