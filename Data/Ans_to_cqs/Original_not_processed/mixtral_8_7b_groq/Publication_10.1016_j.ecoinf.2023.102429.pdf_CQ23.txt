Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the use of a deep learning model for soil nutrient estimation. However, there is information about the performance evaluation of other models used in the study.

To answer the query about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model, we can look at the methods used for evaluating the performance of other models. These methods can provide insights into the generalizability measures that might have been used for a deep learning model if it were part of the study.

The study used four parameters to assess the accuracy of calibrated and validated models: coefficient of determination (R2), root-mean-square error (RMSE), ratio of performance to deviation (RPD), and ratio of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ). These parameters are commonly used to evaluate the performance and generalizability of predictive models.

However, the context does not provide information on whether cross-validation, diverse dataset, or stratified splitting were used to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. Therefore, based on the given information, it is not possible to definitively answer whether these measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

Answer:::
Although the provided context includes information about the performance evaluation of various models used for soil nutrient estimation, there is no direct mention of a deep learning model. The study used R2, RMSE, RPD, and RPIQ as performance evaluation metrics for the models. However, there is no information on whether cross-validation, diverse dataset, or stratified splitting were used to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. As a result, based on the given information, it is not possible to answer whether these measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.
