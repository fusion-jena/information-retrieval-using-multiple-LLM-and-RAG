Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). However, the paper does discuss the methodology for creating fire risk maps using Landsat 8 imagery and vegetation indices. It also mentions the use of machine learning algorithms for evaluating fire risk.

In the context of remote sensing and fire risk assessment, the data splitting criteria could be based on factors such as spatial distribution, temporal distribution, or a combination of both. For instance, one approach could be to split the data based on different geographical regions or time periods, ensuring that each subset contains a representative sample of the data.

Another approach could be to use a stratified sampling method, where the data is divided into subsets based on the fire risk classes (low, medium, high, extreme). This would ensure that each subset contains a balanced representation of the different risk levels.

Additionally, the context suggests that the authors have used a four-class fire risk categorization based on Jenks' natural break classification method. This method aims to maximize the organization of the data into distinct and meaningful classes, which could potentially be used as a basis for splitting the data.

However, without more specific information from the paper, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer. It is recommended to refer to the original paper or contact the authors for more details on the data splitting criteria used in their deep learning model training.
