Answer:::

The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a pre-trained ResNet-50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for feature extraction in a study. In deep learning, randomness can be introduced in various ways, such as through the initialization of weights, the order of training samples, and the use of dropout regularization.

One common way to handle randomness is by setting a random seed value. This ensures that the same sequence of random numbers is generated every time the model is trained, making the training process reproducible. Although the provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value, it is likely that the authors used a fixed seed value to ensure reproducibility in their study.

In the context of using pre-trained CNN models, randomness can be introduced during the feature extraction process. For instance, the order in which the images are fed into the CNN model can affect the extracted features. To handle this, the authors may have randomly shuffled the images before feeding them into the CNN model.

Furthermore, the use of dropout regularization in deep learning models introduces randomness by randomly setting a fraction of the outputs of a layer to zero during training. This helps prevent overfitting by making the model less sensitive to the specific weights of neurons.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that the authors employed common practices such as setting a random seed value, randomly shuffling the order of images, and using dropout regularization to handle randomness in their study.
