Answer:::

The provided context does not specify the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. The model used in the study is Random Forest, which is a type of ensemble learning model that utilizes multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. Random Forest is not a deep learning model such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), or Transformers.

Deep learning models are a subset of machine learning algorithms that are designed to learn from large datasets with complex structures. These models typically have multiple layers of artificial neural networks that enable them to learn and extract features from the data automatically.

In this study, the authors used machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest, to predict the distribution of tropical tuna species in the Indian Ocean. The study aimed to aid sustainable fishing practices by developing species distribution models that could forecast the presence and absence of tuna species in the study area.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not specified. Instead, a machine learning model called Random Forest was used to build the prediction models.
