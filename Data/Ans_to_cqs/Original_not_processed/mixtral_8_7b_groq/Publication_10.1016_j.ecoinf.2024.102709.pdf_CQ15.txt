Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention any specific optimization techniques such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does provide information about the loss functions and evaluation metrics used in the model training process.

The model uses a classification loss (cls loss) computed using a cross-entropy loss function to measure the error in the predicted class probabilities. Additionally, a box loss is used as a regression loss to measure the error in the predicted bounding box coordinates and dimensions relative to the ground truth. The box loss is computed using Intersection over Union (IoU) and distributional focal loss (DFL).

These loss functions are crucial components of the training process, and optimization techniques are used to minimize these loss values during training. Common optimization techniques include SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad. While the specific optimization technique is not mentioned, it can be inferred that some optimization technique was used to minimize the loss values during the training of the model.

Moreover, the context mentions that k-fold cross-validation was used to determine the ideal training-test split for the model. This technique involves training the model on different subsets of the data and evaluating its performance on the remaining data. This approach can help prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of the model.

In summary, while the specific optimization technique used in the deep learning pipeline is not mentioned in the provided context, it can be inferred that some optimization technique was used to minimize the loss values during the training of the model. Additionally, k-fold cross-validation was used to determine the ideal training-test split for the model, which can help improve the generalization of the model.
