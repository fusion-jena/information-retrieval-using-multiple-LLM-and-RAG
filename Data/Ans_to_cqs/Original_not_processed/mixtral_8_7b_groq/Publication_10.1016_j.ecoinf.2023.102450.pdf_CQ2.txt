Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline can utilize various data formats, including images, videos, and CSV files, among others. The specific context provided offers insights into the use of image and video data formats in the pipeline.

In the study "Actions in wildlife videos using deep learning techniques" (Ecological Informatics 79(2024)1024506), the authors employed video data to detect and classify actions in wildlife videos. The dataset consisted of three classes: circular curve, straight line, and 8-shaped curve, with varying numbers of videos and images for each class. The duration of the videos ranged from 0.095 seconds to 28.71 seconds, and the number of images per video varied from 10 to 32.

Another study, "Application of YOLOv4 for detection and motion monitoring of red foxes" (Animals 11 (6), 1723), used video data to detect and monitor red foxes. The YOLOv4 deep learning model was employed for object detection and motion monitoring.

In the context of "Group behavior tracking of Daphnia magna based on motion estimation and appearance models" (Eco. Inform. 61, 101238), the authors used image data to track the group behavior of Daphnia magna. They employed motion estimation and appearance models for tracking, which are components of deep learning pipelines.

These examples demonstrate that image and video data formats are commonly used in the deep learning pipeline for object detection, motion monitoring, and behavior tracking. Additionally, CSV files can also be used in the pipeline for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and result analysis. However, the specific context provided does not mention the use of CSV files directly in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline can use image, video, and CSV data formats. The provided context highlights the use of image and video data formats for object detection, motion monitoring, and behavior tracking in wildlife and ecological studies.
