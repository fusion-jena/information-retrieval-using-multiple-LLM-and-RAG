Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, testing, and validation are not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it does mention that the data is divided into five equal folds in a proposed FAA-based approach. This suggests that a type of cross-validation, specifically five-fold cross-validation, could be used for training, testing, and validation. In cross-validation, the data is divided into multiple folds, and the model is trained on a subset of the folds while the remaining folds are used for testing and validation. This process is repeated for each fold, and the results are averaged to provide a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

Additionally, the context also discusses the use of data augmentation (DA) to increase and diversify the training data. DA techniques such as random transformations or the use of a designed set of DAs can help improve the generalization ability of the network and prevent overfitting.

In terms of the proposed SCAM-Herb model, the context states that the data splitting is reported in Table 1, but the specifics of the table are not provided. It is also mentioned that the model was able to achieve high accuracy with different percentages of training data, indicating that the data was likely split into a training set and a test set for evaluation.

In summary, while the specific criteria used to split the data for training, testing, and validation are not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that cross-validation and data augmentation techniques may be used. Additionally, the proposed SCAM-Herb model was evaluated using a training set and a test set.
