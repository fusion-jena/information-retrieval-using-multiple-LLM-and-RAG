Answer:::

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include rotations, horizontal and vertical flips, and changes in brightness, saturation, and hue. Specifically, random rotations of 0-360 degrees were applied to the input images. Additionally, horizontal and vertical flips were used to increase the diversity of the training data. Changes in brightness, saturation, and hue were implemented by modulating the current values between specific ranges. The brightness was changed by 95-110%, saturation by 95-105%, and hue by 99-101%. However, the hue changes were restricted to a narrow range since significant changes in plant hues were not expected. These data augmentation techniques were used to improve the model's ability to identify features in large amounts of data, including high-resolution imagery, and achieve accuracy similar to human-level classification accuracy.
