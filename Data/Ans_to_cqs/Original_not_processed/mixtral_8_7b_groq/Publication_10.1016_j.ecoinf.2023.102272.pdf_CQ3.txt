Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the parameters tested and values used for each classical machine learning model and deep learning models, as well as the model selection procedure.

However, the deep learning models mentioned in the context, such as Deep Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (DeepConvLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), often use annotated data in the form of labeled images or time-series data for training. Common data annotation techniques for these models include:

1. Image classification: Assigning a label to an entire image, indicating the object or scene present in the image.
2. Object detection: Drawing bounding boxes around objects of interest in an image and assigning a class label to each box.
3. Semantic segmentation: Labeling each pixel in an image according to the object class it belongs to.
4. Instance segmentation: Labeling each pixel in an image according to the object instance it belongs to, allowing multiple instances of the same object class to be distinguished.
5. Time-series annotation: Labeling time-series data points with corresponding classes or values.

Without specific information from the context, it is impossible to determine which of these annotation techniques were used in the deep learning pipeline.
