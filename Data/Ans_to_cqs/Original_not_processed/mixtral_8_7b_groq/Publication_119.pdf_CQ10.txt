Answer:::
I am unable to provide a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline as the context provided does not include information about where the code is hosted. However, based on the context, we know that a U-Net model implemented within the arcgis.learn module of the ArcGIS API for Python was used for image segmentation. The model has a ResNet-50 backbone pretrained on ImageNet. Hyperparameter tuning was done to select the best U-Net model, which uses an input patch size of 64 Ã— 64 pixels.

To learn more about the implementation, you can refer to the following resources:

1. The arcgis.learn module documentation: https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/learn/what-is-arcgislearn.htm
2. The U-Net architecture paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597
3. The ResNet architecture paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385
4. The ImageNet dataset: http://www.image-net.org/

For more information on the specific application of this model in the context of remote sensing and conservation efforts, you may need to refer to the original sources referenced in the provided context or contact the authors directly.
