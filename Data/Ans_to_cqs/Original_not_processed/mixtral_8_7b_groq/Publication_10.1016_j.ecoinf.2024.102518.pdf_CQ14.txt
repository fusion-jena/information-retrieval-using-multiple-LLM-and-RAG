Answer:::

The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using the delta in the Akaike minimum information criterion (delta.AICc) as the metric to determine the best tuning parameters. The optimal model is the one with the minimum delta.AICc value (delta.AICc = 0), and a model with delta.AICc <2 is considered credible (Phillips et al., 2017).

The hyperparameters optimized in this study are the feature class and the regularization multiplier. The feature class is set as ‘L', ‘Q', ‘LQ', ‘LQP’, and the regularization multiplier is varied from 0.5 to 5. The performance of the model is evaluated across these tuning parameters (Figure A.2). However, the context does not explicitly mention the use of techniques such as grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization.

In the absence of specific information, it can be inferred that a manual or systematic search approach might have been employed to find the optimal combination of feature class and regularization multiplier. This approach would involve training and evaluating models with different combinations of hyperparameters and selecting the one with the best performance based on the delta.AICc metric.

It is also worth noting that the study follows the standards for distribution models in biodiversity assessments (Araújo et al., 2019) and considers the challenges in obtaining true absences (Jiménez and Soberón, 2020). To account for this, the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) was employed in addition to the Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). The final optimal parameters were identified as the feature class ‘LQP’ and a regularization multiplier of 3.5, with a mean AUC-ROC of 95.5% and an average CBI index of 82.6% for the validation dataset.
