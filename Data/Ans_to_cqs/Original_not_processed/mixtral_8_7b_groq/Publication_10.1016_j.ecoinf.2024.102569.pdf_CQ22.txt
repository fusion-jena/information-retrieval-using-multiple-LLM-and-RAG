Based on the provided context, the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are not mentioned. The text focuses on the use of the Root Trimmed Mean Squared Prediction Error (RTMSPE) to select the appropriate values for the tuning parameters τ and ϕ in a different context.

However, in general, deep learning models can be evaluated using various metrics, depending on the specific problem and the nature of the data. Here are some commonly used metrics for evaluating deep learning models:

1. Accuracy: It is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. It is a common metric for classification problems.
2. Precision: It is the ratio of the number of true positive predictions (relevant items that are correctly identified) to the total number of positive predictions (relevant items that are identified, whether they are true or false). It is useful when the cost of false positives is high.
3. Recall (Sensitivity): It is the ratio of the number of true positive predictions to the total number of relevant items. It is useful when the cost of false negatives is high.
4. F1-score: It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics. It is a more robust metric than accuracy, especially for imbalanced datasets.
5. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): It is the average of the absolute differences between predicted and actual values. It is useful for regression problems.
6. Mean Squared Error (MSE): It is the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values. It is sensitive to outliers and is useful for regression problems.
7. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): It is the square root of the MSE, providing a metric in the same units as the target variable. It is useful for regression problems.
8. Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC): It is a metric for binary classification problems, measuring the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.
9. Mean Per-Class Accuracy (MPCA): It is the average of the class-wise accuracies, providing a better representation of the model's performance for multi-class problems.

These metrics can be used individually or in combination, depending on the specific problem and the requirements of the task. It is essential to choose the appropriate metrics to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model accurately.
