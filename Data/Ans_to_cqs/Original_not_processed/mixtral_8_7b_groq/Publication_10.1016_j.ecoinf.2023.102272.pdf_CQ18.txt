Answer:

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a validation data set at different stages of the model selection and training process. Specifically, the data was partitioned into five sets: At (25% of the data) for training candidate models, Av (50% of the data) for validating candidate models, Bt (75% of the data, which is the combination of At and Av) for training the selected candidate model, Bv (25% of the data) for determining the optimal number of epochs to train the selected candidate model, and T (used separately for each year) for assessing the predictive performance of the fully trained model.

During the model selection procedure, the performance of the 20 generated models (five models for each of the four available deep-ANN architecture types) was compared using the validation data set (Av) after training each model with a small subset of the training data (At) for four epochs. The model with the highest performance was then selected for training on the full training data (Bt) for up to 30 epochs, and the optimal number of training epochs was determined using the validation data set (Bv).

After full training, the model's predictive performance was evaluated using the test data (T) for all years. The results showed that the model delivered excellent average predictive performance for all years, except for a few cases where the performance was fair or good for certain classes and years.

Furthermore, the importance of variables was assessed by randomizing the predictor 'number of eggs' and temperature variables (mean, maximum, or minimum). The results showed that the AUC decreased most notably when the 'number of eggs' was randomized, indicating its importance in the model's performance.

Therefore, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involves using a validation data set to compare the performance of candidate models, determine the optimal number of training epochs, and evaluate the predictive performance of the fully trained model. Additionally, the importance of variables was assessed by randomizing certain predictors and evaluating the model's performance.
