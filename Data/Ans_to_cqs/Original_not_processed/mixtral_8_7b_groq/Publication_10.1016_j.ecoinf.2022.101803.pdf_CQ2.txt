Answer:::
The provided context does not give information about the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of datasets in the context of machine learning and ecological informatics.

The Sparrow population dataset is mentioned as one of the real-life datasets used in the study. The other datasets mentioned include simulated datasets from Matthiopoulos et al. (2015) and (2011), as well as a Wolf dataset. While the context does not explicitly state the data format of these datasets, it is mentioned that they include habitat variables, food, temperature, population size, grass, bush, roof, colony size, distance to high human use, slope, burnt, alpine, shrub, rock, and herbaceous. This suggests that the datasets are likely in a tabular format such as CSV, where each variable is represented by a column and each observation is represented by a row.

Furthermore, the study mentions the use of the XGBoost algorithm, which is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both regression and classification tasks. XGBoost can handle various data formats, including tabular data (CSV), image data, and text data. However, the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific data format used in this study.

Therefore, while the provided context does not give specific information about the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline, it can be inferred that the datasets used in the study are likely in a tabular format such as CSV.
