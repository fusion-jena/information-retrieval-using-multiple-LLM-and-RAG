The provided context discusses the `ibis.iSDM` package, which aims to create less biased representations of a species' niche while accounting for some of the biases present in biodiversity datasets. However, the context does not explicitly mention the techniques used for addressing data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. It focuses more on the integration of various data sources and models to improve the accuracy and robustness of species distribution models (SDMs).

Nonetheless, some of the techniques mentioned in the context can be indirectly related to addressing data bias during preprocessing:

1. **Dataset-specific weights or factor interactions:** These options allow accounting for differences in included datasets, which can help reduce bias from individual data sources.
2. **Sequential estimation:** This method involves fitting a model using one biodiversity data source and a specific set of covariates, then using the output of the resulting prediction as an offset to estimate the distribution with a different biodiversity or covariate data. This can help reduce bias by incorporating information from multiple data sources.
3. **Model-based integration:** This technique considers all available data, which can help reduce bias by using a more comprehensive dataset for model training.

While these techniques do not directly correspond to the preprocessing methods mentioned in the query (stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection), they still contribute to addressing data bias in SDMs.

In the context of deep learning pipelines, the following techniques could be applied for addressing data bias during preprocessing:

1. **Stratified splitting:** This method involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria (e.g., class labels) and then randomly splitting each subgroup to ensure a balanced representation in the training and testing sets.
2. **Oversampling and undersampling:** Oversampling replicates instances from the minority class to balance the dataset, while undersampling reduces instances from the majority class. These techniques can help reduce bias caused by class imbalance.
3. **Diverse data collection:** Collecting data from various sources, environments, and conditions can help ensure a more representative and unbiased dataset.

In summary, although the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing, some of the discussed methods contribute to reducing bias in SDMs. Additionally, some common techniques for addressing data bias during preprocessing in deep learning pipelines include stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
