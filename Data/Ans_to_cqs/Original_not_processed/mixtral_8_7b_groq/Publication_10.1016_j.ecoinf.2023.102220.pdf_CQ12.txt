Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network, which is a specific type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This information can be inferred from the context that states, "We used the LSTM method by adding a long short term memory block on the DNNâ€™s architecture." Recurrent Neural Networks are a class of artificial neural networks that are particularly well-suited for processing sequential data, as they have loops that allow information to persist and be passed from one step in the sequence to the next. LSTMs are a type of RNN that are capable of learning long-term dependencies, making them particularly useful for tasks such as time series prediction and natural language processing.
