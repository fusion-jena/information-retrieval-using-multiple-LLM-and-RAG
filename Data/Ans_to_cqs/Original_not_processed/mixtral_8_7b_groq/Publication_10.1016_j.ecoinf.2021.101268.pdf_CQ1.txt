The context provided does not give specific information about how the raw data was collected for the Peruvian Amazon Forestry Dataset. However, it does mention that the dataset includes 59,441 samples from ten of the most profitable and endangered species in the Peruvian Amazon forest. Six different commercial cameras were used to ensure variability and to develop flexible solutions for real-world conditions.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the data was collected using camera sensors, but the specific acquisition protocol is not provided. It is also possible that other methods, such as surveys or existing public datasets, were used to supplement the camera data. However, without further information, it is not possible to give a definitive answer.
