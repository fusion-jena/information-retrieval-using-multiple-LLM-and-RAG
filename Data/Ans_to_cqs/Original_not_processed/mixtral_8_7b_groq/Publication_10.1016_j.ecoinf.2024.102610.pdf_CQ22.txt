The provided context does not specifically mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model for predicting disease vectors. However, it does discuss the evaluation of machine learning models for predicting tsetse fly relative numbers.

The performance of the trained models for tsetse fly prediction was evaluated based on the "out-of-bag" R2 and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) values. R2, or the coefficient of determination, indicates how well the model generalizes the unseen data, while RMSE measures the difference between the predicted and actual values.

In addition, variable importance was determined using the permutation method, and partial dependence plots were generated using the 'pdp' package to show the impact of each predictor on the response variable.

As for deep learning models, the context mentions a study by Ceia-Hasse et al. (2023) that demonstrated an improved performance of deep learning over classical machine learning in predicting the abundance of yellow fever mosquitoes in Madeira, Portugal. The study used area under the curve (AUC) values to compare the performance of the models. AUC is a metric commonly used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of classification models, where it represents the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of a deep learning model for predicting disease vectors, it suggests that R2, RMSE, variable importance, partial dependence plots, and AUC values are possible metrics that could be used for such evaluation.
