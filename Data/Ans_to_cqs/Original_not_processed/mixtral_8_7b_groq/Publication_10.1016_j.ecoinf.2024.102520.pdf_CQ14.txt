Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. The text focuses on the use of the geostatistical analyst extension of ArcGIS v.9.3.1 for semivariogram computation, cross-validation, and mapping. It also explains the assessment of soil maps' accuracy using cross-validation techniques like mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and quality of prediction (G).

However, it does mention the use of four models (Gaussian, spherical, exponential, and linear) for analyzing the four lands based on scaled semi-variance data. The performance of these models is evaluated using R2 and RMSE values. It can be inferred that the model selection might have been based on the comparison of these evaluation metrics.

Moreover, the text highlights the extensive sampling employed in the study to reduce sample error and increase Kriging accuracy. This suggests that the optimization of the model's performance could also be influenced by the quality and quantity of data used in the study.

In conclusion, while the context does not provide specific details about the optimization of hyperparameters through methods like grid search or random search, it does mention the comparison of models based on evaluation metrics and the influence of data quality and quantity on the model's performance.
