The provided context does not include information about the data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the use of machine learning models, specifically LightGBM and other base models, for classification tasks using multi-source feature datasets.

Data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize. These techniques involve creating new synthetic samples by applying transformations to the existing data.

Flipping refers to horizontally or vertically flipping the images in the dataset. This technique helps the model to become invariant to the direction of the objects in the image.

Rotating involves rotating the images by a certain angle. This helps the model to learn features that are invariant to orientation.

Scaling involves changing the size of the image. This technique helps the model to learn features that are invariant to scale.

However, the provided context does not mention any of these techniques being applied in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, the answer to the query is that the provided context does not contain information on the data augmentation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
