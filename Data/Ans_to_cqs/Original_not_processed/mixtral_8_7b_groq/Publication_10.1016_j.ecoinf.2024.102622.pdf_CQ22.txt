The provided context does not include information on the evaluation of a deep learning model specifically. However, it does provide details on the evaluation of machine learning models for rice canopy coverage and chlorophyll content estimation.

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the machine learning models in the context include:

1. Coefficient of Determination (RÂ²): This metric measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s). It provides a measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model, based on the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model.
2. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): This metric measures the average magnitude of the error in a set of predictions. It is the square root of the mean of the squared differences between predicted and observed values. A lower RMSE indicates better model performance.
3. Relative Error of Prediction (REP): This metric measures the relative error between predicted and observed values. It is calculated as the absolute difference between predicted and observed values divided by the observed value, multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage. A lower REP indicates better model performance.

These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of regression models, including machine learning and deep learning models. However, the context does not specify if any deep learning models were used or evaluated. Therefore, the answer to the query is limited to the metrics used for evaluating machine learning models in the provided context.
