Answer:::
The code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study is available on GitHub. You can access it using the following link: <https://github.com/BenMcEwen1/Sparse-Noise-Reduction>. This repository contains the code for the sparse noise reduction method applied to the bioacoustic datasets. The method uses a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to denoise the audio recordings. The implementation details, model architecture, and training procedures are provided in the repository. Additionally, the evaluation datasets used in the study are also available in separate repositories linked in the provided context.
