The provided context does not directly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of a crawling tool to gather data from various remote sensing products (SRS) and the importance of data coverage and calibration.

In the context of remote sensing data, bias can arise from factors such as atmospheric conditions, sensor limitations, and regional differences. To address these biases, the following techniques could be applied during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria (e.g., geographical regions, time of day, or weather conditions) and then randomly sampling from each subgroup. This ensures that each subset of the data used for training, validation, and testing contains a representative distribution of the original data.

2. Oversampling: In cases where certain classes or subgroups are underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from these classes. This can help prevent the deep learning model from being biased towards the more common classes.

3. Undersampling: Conversely, if certain classes or subgroups are overrepresented in the dataset, undersampling can be used to reduce the number of instances from these classes. This can help prevent the deep learning model from being overfit to the more common classes.

4. Diverse data collection: To minimize bias in the dataset, it is essential to collect data from a wide variety of sources, including different geographical regions, sensors, and environmental conditions. This can help ensure that the deep learning model is exposed to a diverse range of input patterns and is better able to generalize to new, unseen data.

In the context of remote sensing data, the crawling tool mentioned in the provided context could be used to gather data from multiple sources (ESA, NASA) and various NetCDF files, which include parameters such as reflectance, Aerosol Optical Thickness (Kd940), and Chl-a (AOT). By increasing the data acquisition window and implementing regional calibration of SRS algorithms, the impact of bias due to temporal and spatial variations can be mitigated.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, the concepts of stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be applied to remote sensing data to minimize bias and improve model performance.
