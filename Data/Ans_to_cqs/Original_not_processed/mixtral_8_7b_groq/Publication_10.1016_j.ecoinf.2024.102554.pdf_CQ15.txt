The provided context discusses the use of a crawling tool for gathering data from different SRS products and the application of machine learning methodologies for satellite data interpretation, particularly in estimating Chl-a concentrations. However, it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Optimization techniques like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam are commonly used in deep learning pipelines for training models. These techniques help minimize the loss function and improve the model's performance.

- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an optimization algorithm used to update the parameters of a model based on the gradient of the loss function. It is an iterative algorithm that processes one training example at a time, making it computationally efficient.

- Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation) is another optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of SGD and other optimization methods like Adagrad and RMSProp. Adam adaptively adjusts the learning rate based on the first and second moments of the gradients, making it suitable for complex optimization problems.

Without specific information from the provided context, it is not possible to determine if these or other optimization techniques are used in the deep learning pipeline for satellite data interpretation.

Answer:::
The provided context does not offer specific details about the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for satellite data interpretation. Commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam.
