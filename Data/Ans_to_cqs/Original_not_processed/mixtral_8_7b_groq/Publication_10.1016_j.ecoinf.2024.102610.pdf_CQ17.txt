The provided context discusses the use of machine learning techniques, specifically the classical random forest method, in predicting the abundance of disease vectors. It also explains two variable elimination techniques, Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and VSURF, used to enhance the precision of the model and prevent overfitting. However, it does not mention any regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization.

Regularization methods are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data that may not generalize well to unseen data. Dropout is a regularization technique used in neural networks where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent over-reliance on any single neuron and encourages the model to learn more robust features. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the model weights. This encourages the model to learn smaller weights, which can help to reduce overfitting by preventing the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.

In summary, while the provided context discusses techniques used to prevent overfitting in machine learning models, it does not mention any regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines. Regularization methods such as dropout and L2 regularization are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function and encouraging the model to learn more robust features.
