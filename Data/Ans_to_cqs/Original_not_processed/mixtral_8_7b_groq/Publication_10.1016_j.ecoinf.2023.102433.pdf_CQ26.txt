The provided context discusses various topics related to data management, handling, and protection, as well as the methods and functionalities of the NasaWebServiceAPIProvider class. However, it does not directly mention techniques used to address data bias during deep learning preprocessing such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection.

Stratified splitting is a technique used to ensure that each subset (e.g., training, validation, testing) of the data contains a representative proportion of the classes present in the original dataset. Oversampling and undersampling are techniques used to balance the class distribution in the dataset by either duplicating samples from the minority class (oversampling) or removing samples from the majority class (undersampling). Diverse data collection refers to the process of gathering data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population or phenomenon being studied.

While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, it is important to note that handling and managing data bias is a crucial aspect of any data analysis or machine learning project. The context does mention the use of Global Subset methods for data redundancy management and real-time queries, which can help ensure that the data used in the analysis is up-to-date and relevant. Additionally, the context highlights the importance of data protection and licensing, which can help ensure that the data used is ethically sourced and used in compliance with relevant regulations and policies.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly mention techniques used to address data bias during deep learning preprocessing, it is still crucial to consider these techniques when working with any dataset. The context highlights the importance of data management and handling, which can indirectly contribute to reducing data bias.
