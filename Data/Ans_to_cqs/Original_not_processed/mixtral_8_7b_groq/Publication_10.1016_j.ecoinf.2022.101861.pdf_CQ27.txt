The provided context does not give detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that a machine learning-powered BirdNET app was used to reduce barriers to global bird research by enabling citizen science participation (Wood et al., 2022). This app likely involves model serialization and platform selection for deployment.

Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model to a file so that it can be loaded and used later without having to retrain the model. This allows for easy distribution and deployment of the model. The context does not provide specific details on how the model was serialized.

Platform selection is an important step in deploying a machine learning model. The platform chosen should be able to handle the computational requirements of the model and provide a user-friendly interface for accessing the model's predictions. The BirdNET app is a platform that allows citizen scientists to upload bird observations and recordings, which are then processed using the trained deep learning model. The app likely runs on a mobile platform, such as iOS or Android, making it accessible to a wide audience.

In addition, the context mentions that Xeno-canto, a public, citizen-based, birdsong repository, was used to host over 714,000 recordings of 10,300 bird species. This repository likely served as a source of data for training the deep learning model. The large number of labeled recordings allowed for the development of machine-learning algorithms able to automatically identify 3000 bird species by their sound.

Overall, while the context does not provide detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the model was serialized for distribution and deployment on a mobile platform, such as the BirdNET app. The Xeno-canto repository likely served as a source of data for training the model.
