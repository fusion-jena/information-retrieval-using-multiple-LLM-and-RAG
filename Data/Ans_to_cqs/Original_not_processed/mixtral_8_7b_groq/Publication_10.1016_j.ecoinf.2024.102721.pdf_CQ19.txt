Based on the information provided, the specific deep learning model used in the study is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. However, the text does not explicitly mention which framework or software was used to build this LSTM model. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.

It's important to note that there are several popular deep learning frameworks available, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and others. While the study does mention that the Bayesian optimization learning software package based on Python was used, this does not necessarily imply that the same package was used to build the LSTM model. Bayesian optimization can be used as a method to tune hyperparameters in deep learning models, but it does not dictate the use of a specific deep learning framework.

In summary, the text does not provide sufficient information to determine which framework was used to build the LSTM model.
