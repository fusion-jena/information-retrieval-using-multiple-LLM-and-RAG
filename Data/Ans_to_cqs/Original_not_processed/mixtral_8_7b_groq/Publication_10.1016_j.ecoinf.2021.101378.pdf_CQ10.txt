Answer:::
I couldn't find a specific code repository link for a deep learning pipeline used to predict the potential occurrence of pine wilt disease in the provided context. However, the authors used R packages such as "randomForest" and "maxent" for their machine learning algorithms. Additionally, the paper by Iordache et al. (2020) used a machine learning approach for pine wilt disease detection, but they didn't mention a specific code repository either.

For deep learning approaches, you can look into Keras, TensorFlow, or PyTorch libraries in Python, which are popular for implementing deep learning models. You can build a deep learning pipeline for predicting pine wilt disease by incorporating environmental factors and relevant GIS data.

Here's a simple example of how you can start building a deep learning pipeline using Keras:

1. Import necessary libraries:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
```

2. Load your dataset (replace 'your_data.csv' with your actual dataset):

```python
data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')
X = data.drop('target_column', axis=1)
y = data['target_column']
```

3. Preprocess your data:

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

4. Build a deep learning model:

```python
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(32, input_dim=X_train.shape[1], activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(16, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

5. Train the model:

```python
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))
```

You can extend this example by incorporating spatial data, climate change factors, and other relevant features. You can also use more sophisticated deep learning architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) depending on your data requirements.
