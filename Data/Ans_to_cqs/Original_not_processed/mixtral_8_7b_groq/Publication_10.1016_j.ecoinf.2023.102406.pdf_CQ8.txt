Answer:::

The provided pieces of context do not contain information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. The sources mainly discuss topics related to biodiversity, ecology, econometrics, and statistical methods such as variable selection using random forests. Therefore, I cannot provide the location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline.
