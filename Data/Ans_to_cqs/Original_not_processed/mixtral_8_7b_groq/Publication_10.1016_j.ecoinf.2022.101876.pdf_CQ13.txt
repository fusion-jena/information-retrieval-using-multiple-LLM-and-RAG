Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the learning rate, optimizer, or other hyperparameters used in the deep learning model (MegaDetector) for detecting wildlife in camera trap images from Arctic Alaska. The text focuses on the performance metrics of the model, such as True Positive Rate (TPR) and MegaDetector Detection Thresholds, and how these metrics change based on different conditions and parameters.

However, the context does mention that the model's performance can be influenced by factors such as training data, object class, and image characteristics (e.g., complex vegetation, poor lighting, low image resolution, and unique camera angles). This implies that the model's hyperparameters might have been adjusted based on these factors to optimize the performance.

In general, deep learning models like MegaDetector use various hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, optimizer (e.g., Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adam), and regularization techniques (e.g., L1, L2, dropout) to control the learning process and prevent overfitting. The choice of these hyperparameters depends on the specific problem, dataset, and computational resources.

To get detailed information about the hyperparameters used in the MegaDetector model, one should refer to the original paper, code repository, or documentation provided by the authors or developers of the model.
