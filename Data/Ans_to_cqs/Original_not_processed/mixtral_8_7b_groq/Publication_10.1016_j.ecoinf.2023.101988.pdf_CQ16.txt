Based on the provided context, there is not enough information to directly answer the query about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context consists of ecological research data, tables, and descriptions of fieldwork sessions.

However, in the context of machine learning or deep learning model training, the criteria to determine training completion often include:

1. Validation loss plateau: Training stops when the validation loss doesn't decrease for a certain number of epochs.
2. Early stopping: Training stops if the validation loss starts increasing, even if the training loss is still decreasing.
3. Patience: A hyperparameter that defines the number of epochs to wait before stopping the training if the validation loss doesn't improve.
4. Maximum number of epochs: Training stops when the predefined maximum number of epochs is reached.

In summary, the provided context does not contain information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The mentioned criteria are common practices in machine learning and deep learning model training.
