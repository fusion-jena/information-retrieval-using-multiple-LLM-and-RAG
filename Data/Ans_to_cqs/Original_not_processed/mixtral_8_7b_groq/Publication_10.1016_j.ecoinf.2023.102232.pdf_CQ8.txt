Answer:::

The code repository for the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The text focuses on the use of the DAFNE HPC scientific computing center for calculations and the implementation of a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithm and a genetic algorithm for solving an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) system. The scripts and dataset used to reproduce the results are available in a GitHub repository (<https://github.com/lucaros1190/LS-MCMC-hybridGenAlgo>), but it does not appear to contain the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide the specific location of the deep learning pipeline code repository.
