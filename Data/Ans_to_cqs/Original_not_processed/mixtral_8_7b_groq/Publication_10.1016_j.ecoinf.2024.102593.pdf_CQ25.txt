Answer:::
The deep learning models discussed in the context are used for the purpose of classifying audio data into specific categories of bird species. These models are trained on two datasets, NIPS4Bplus and BirdCLEF 2020, using detailed labels associated with the datasets. The models include a SincNet model from earlier work and residual network models with a ResNet152-architecture.

The authors use a technique called transfer learning, where embeddings from an existing model are used to train new models on previously unseen data. Embeddings are a type of feature representation that captures the underlying characteristics of the input data. In this case, the embeddings are generated using the BirdNET model on a randomly selected 40% sample of the NIPS4Bplus dataset.

The purpose of using embeddings is to assist in model selection for classifying unseen data. By analyzing the embeddings, the authors can gain insights into the inner workings of the models and improve their utilization. This technique is particularly useful for classifying audio data, where the models can be difficult to interpret due to their complex architecture.

In summary, the deep learning models discussed in the context are used for classifying audio data into specific categories of bird species. The authors use transfer learning and embeddings to improve the utilization of the models and gain insights into their inner workings.
