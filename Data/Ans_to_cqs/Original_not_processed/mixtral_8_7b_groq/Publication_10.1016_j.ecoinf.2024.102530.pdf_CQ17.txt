The provided context does not include information about deep learning pipelines, regularization methods, dropout, or L2 regularization. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.

However, I can give some background information on regularization methods that are often used in deep learning to prevent overfitting.

Overfitting is a common problem in machine learning, where a model learns the training data too well, including its noise, and performs poorly on unseen data. Regularization methods are techniques used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, which discourages the model from learning overly complex patterns in the training data.

Two common regularization methods used in deep learning are L1 and L2 regularization. L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the model's weights. This has the effect of shrinking some of the weights to zero, effectively eliminating the corresponding features from the model. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay or Ridge regularization, adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the model's weights. This has the effect of shrinking all of the weights, but not eliminating any of them.

Another regularization method commonly used in deep learning is dropout. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are "dropped out" of the network during training, effectively preventing them from contributing to the forward pass. This has the effect of making the network more robust and less prone to overfitting.

These regularization methods can be used in combination to achieve better performance and prevent overfitting. The choice of regularization method and its hyperparameters depends on the specific problem and the architecture of the deep learning model.
