Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The context includes several research papers and tables comparing the performance of different ResNet architectures in various tasks such as underwater video processing, plant identification, and biodiversity trend analysis using neural networks. However, there is no mention of the code repository or where the source code can be found. It is possible that the code was not made publicly available, or it was not specified in the given text. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
