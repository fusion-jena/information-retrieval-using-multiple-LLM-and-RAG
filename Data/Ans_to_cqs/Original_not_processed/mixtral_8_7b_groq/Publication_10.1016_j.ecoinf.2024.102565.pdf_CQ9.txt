Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study titled "Lake total suspended matter retrieval by wind speed: A machine learning model trained by time-series satellite imagery" published in the Ecological Informatics journal. The study describes a model developed to retrieve total suspended matter in Chah-Nimeh reservoirs using a neural network model trained by time-series satellite imagery. However, the context does not mention where the data repository for this deep learning pipeline is available.

The study cites several sources related to neural networks and remote sensing techniques, including "The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction" by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman, "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville, and "Remote Sensing of Environment" by He et al. However, none of these sources provide information about the data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query as the information is not available in the given context.
