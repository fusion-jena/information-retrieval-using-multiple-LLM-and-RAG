The provided context includes a table comparing the classification accuracies of various methods using multi-textural features, but it does not specifically mention a deep learning model or the use of metrics such as precision and recall. However, it does mention the use of the overall accuracy (OA) and the Kappa index as metrics for evaluating the performance of classification methods.

The OA represents the aggregate classification accuracy, and it is positively correlated with the Kappa index (K). The Kappa index is a measure of the agreement between the predicted and actual classifications, taking into account the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance. It provides a more robust measure of classification accuracy than the OA alone, especially when the class distribution is imbalanced.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of a confusion matrix, which is a table that summarizes the classification results, including the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. From these values, precision and recall can be calculated as:

* Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives)
* Recall = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)

Precision measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions, while recall measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.

Therefore, while the provided context does not specifically mention the use of precision and recall for evaluating a deep learning model, it does imply their use indirectly through the mention of a confusion matrix and the calculation of the Kappa index.
