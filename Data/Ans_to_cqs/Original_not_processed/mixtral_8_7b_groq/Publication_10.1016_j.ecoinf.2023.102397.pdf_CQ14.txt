Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given on how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. The sources mention the use of various methods and techniques such as deep learning, random forests, and different software programs for species distribution modeling and bird song detection, but they do not specify the use of grid search, random search, or any other specific method for hyperparameter optimization. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query. It is possible that the authors used a method that is not specified in the given text, or perhaps they did not include those details in their publications. Without further information, it is not possible to accurately answer this query.
