Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The document focuses on the performance evaluation of classifiers for detecting objects in marine environments using thermal images.

However, based on general machine learning practices, there are several common criteria used to determine when training is complete:

1. Validation loss plateau: Training stops when the validation loss does not decrease for a certain number of epochs, indicating that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training data.

2. Early stopping: Training is halted when the performance on a validation set starts to degrade, even if the training loss is still decreasing, to prevent overfitting.

3. Monitoring other metrics: Training can be stopped based on other metrics, such as accuracy or F1-score, if they reach a satisfactory level or stop improving.

4. Fixed number of epochs: Training can be set to stop after a fixed number of epochs, regardless of the performance on the validation set, as a simple heuristic.

Without more specific information from the provided context, it's impossible to give a definitive answer. However, based on general practices, one or more of these criteria are likely used to determine when training is complete.
