Answer:::

The context does not provide specific information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized in Approach 1. However, it is mentioned that all pre-trained models under Approach 1 converged the training after 1000 epochs with stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM) as the optimization algorithm. This suggests that the hyperparameters of the models were optimized using some method, but it is not specified what method was used.

In Approach 2, the context cites two sources that use different methods for hyperparameter optimization. The first source, "Hyperparameter-tuned batch-updated stochastic gradient descent: plant species identification by using hybrid deep learning" by Barhate et al., does not specify the method used for hyperparameter optimization. The second source, "Quantification of sheet nacre morphogenesis using X-ray nanotomography and deep learning" by Beliaev et al., uses a grid search for hyperparameter optimization.

Therefore, it can be said that the hyperparameters of the models in Approach 2 were optimized using either grid search or an unspecified method. However, the specific method used for Approach 1 is not mentioned in the context.
