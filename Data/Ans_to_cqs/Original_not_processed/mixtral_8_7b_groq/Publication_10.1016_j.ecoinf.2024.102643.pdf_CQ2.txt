The provided context does not contain information about the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of various statistical models and methods for analyzing data in the context of ecology and biodiversity.

In general, deep learning models can handle a variety of data formats, including images, audio, video, and structured data in the form of CSV files or similar formats. The choice of data format will depend on the specific problem being addressed and the type of data that is available.

For example, if the goal is to recognize different species of animals in images, then the data format would typically be images. In this case, the deep learning model might use a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, which is specifically designed to handle image data.

On the other hand, if the goal is to analyze time-series data, such as audio recordings of animal calls, then the data format would be audio. In this case, the deep learning model might use a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture, which is designed to handle sequential data.

In the context of the provided articles, the data formats are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is likely that the data used in these studies was structured data in the form of CSV files or similar formats, as this is a common format for ecological and biodiversity data. The specific statistical models and methods used in these studies, such as Classification Tree Analyses (CTA) or Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS), are typically used with structured data.

In summary, while the provided context does not contain information about the specific data formats used in a deep learning pipeline, it is clear that deep learning models can handle a variety of data formats, including images, audio, video, and structured data. The choice of data format will depend on the specific problem being addressed and the type of data that is available.
