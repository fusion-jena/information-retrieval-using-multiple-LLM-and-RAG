Answer:::

The generalizability of the deep learning model was ensured through several measures. Firstly, the diversity of the dataset was taken into account by considering images of various resolutions and normalizing them to the same range (227x197 pixels) based on the mean dimensions of the set. This step helped in creating a standardized dataset that could be used for training the model.

Secondly, the study selected six open-source Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for model optimization, including VGG16, ResNet50, ResNet101, Inception-v3, DenseNet201, and EfficientNetB0. These algorithms were chosen because of their high performance on similar classification tasks and ease for transfer learning. This step helped in ensuring that the model could perform well on a variety of tasks and not just be limited to a specific type of classification problem.

Thirdly, the study used 5-fold cross-validation over the dataset to evaluate the performance of the models. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a model will generalize to an independent dataset. In this approach, the dataset is divided into five subsets, and at each iteration of the 5-fold cross-validation, one subset is used to evaluate the models, while the remaining four subsets are used for training and validation. This technique provides a robust and unbiased estimate of a model's performance while also guiding effective hyper-parameter tuning for improved overall performance.

Lastly, the study used a learning rate of 10 for the EfficientNetB0 and Inception-v3 models, which showed high accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and f1-score. This step helped in fine-tuning the model and improving its generalizability.

Therefore, the study ensured the generalizability of the deep learning model by using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, selecting high-performing algorithms, and fine-tuning the model using appropriate learning rates.
