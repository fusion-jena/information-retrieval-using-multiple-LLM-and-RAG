Answer:::

While the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of a "random forest classifier" in one study. A random forest is an ensemble learning method that inherently uses randomness to improve the robustness and accuracy of its predictions.

In a random forest, multiple decision trees are constructed using different subsets of the training data, with each tree being trained to classify the data. During the tree construction, randomness is introduced by selecting a random subset of features at each node to determine the best split. This process, known as feature bagging, reduces overfitting and improves the generalization ability of the model.

As for the use of a random seed value, it is typically employed to ensure reproducibility of the results in deep learning models. By setting a specific seed value, the random number generator used in the model is initialized to a known state, which in turn determines the sequence of random numbers generated during the training process. This ensures that the same initial weights, data splits, or other random events occur during each training run, allowing for consistent results to be obtained.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of a random forest classifier, which employs randomness as an inherent part of its design. Additionally, the use of a random seed value is a common practice in deep learning to ensure reproducibility of results.
