Answer:::

The document describes the use of L2 regularization in the deep learning pipeline to prevent overfitting. L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, is a method that discourages large parameter values in the model by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Specifically, the loss function in this case includes an L2 regularization term that is proportional to the square of the L2 norm of the model parameters, as shown in equation (1) of the document. The strength of this regularization is controlled by the hyperparameter Î», which is inversely proportional to the magnitude of the weight decay.

However, the document does not mention the use of other regularization methods such as dropout. Dropout is a technique that randomly sets a fraction of the neurons in a layer to zero during training, which helps to prevent overfitting by reducing the co-adaptation of neurons. It is commonly used in deep learning pipelines, but it is not mentioned in this particular document.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline uses L2 regularization as a method to prevent overfitting. However, it is unclear whether other regularization methods such as dropout are also used.
