Answer:::

The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include the number of epochs, batch size, dropout rate, learning rate, and optimization algorithm. The model is trained for 150 epochs, which refers to the number of times the learning algorithm will work through the entire training dataset. A batch size of 128 is used, meaning that the model will process 128 samples before updating the internal model parameters.

To prevent overfitting and improve model stability, dropout is employed with a rate of 0.3. Dropout is a regularization technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent overreliance on specific neurons and improves the model's ability to generalize.

The ADAM optimizer is used with a learning rate of 0.0001. The learning rate determines the size of the steps that the model takes during gradient descent, and a smaller learning rate typically leads to more accurate results at the cost of slower convergence. The ADAM optimizer is an extension of stochastic gradient descent that combines the advantages of two other optimization algorithms, AdaGrad and RMSProp, to adaptively adjust the learning rate for each parameter.

In summary, the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model are:

1. Number of epochs: 150
2. Batch size: 128
3. Dropout rate: 0.3
4. Learning rate: 0.0001
5. Optimizer: ADAM

These hyperparameters are chosen based on the authors' experience and prior knowledge of the dataset and problem. Different hyperparameters may be required for other datasets or problems.
