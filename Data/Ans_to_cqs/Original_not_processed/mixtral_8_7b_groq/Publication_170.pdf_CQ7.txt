Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about how the data was split for training, testing, and validation of the deep learning models. However, it does mention that the same test set (Test) was used to evaluate the performance of the models in different training phases. Additionally, the x-axis in Figures 3 and 4 represents the percentage of training samples in the BMXSM data set, corresponding to different training sets Traini (i = 1, 2, ..., 7). This suggests that the data was likely split into multiple training sets for the purpose of training the models with different percentages of the total data.

In the absence of specific information, it is common practice in machine learning to split the data into three sets: training, validation, and testing. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and select the best model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the final performance of the model.
