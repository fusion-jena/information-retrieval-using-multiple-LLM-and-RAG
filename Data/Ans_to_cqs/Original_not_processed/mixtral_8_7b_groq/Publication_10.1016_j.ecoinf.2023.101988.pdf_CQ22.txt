The specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the context of the provided sources are not explicitly stated. However, based on the general practices in machine learning and the nature of the problem, it is likely that the following metrics were used:

1. Accuracy: This is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. It gives an overall idea of how well the model is performing.

2. Precision: This is the ratio of true positive predictions (correctly identified) to the total predicted positives (both correct and incorrect). It is useful when the cost of a false positive is high.

3. Recall (Sensitivity): This is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives. It is useful when the cost of a false negative is high.

These metrics are commonly used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models, particularly in classification tasks. In the context of the sources provided, the deep learning model is used for modelling animal biodiversity using acoustic monitoring (Chalmers et al., 2021). The model would be trained to classify different animal species based on their acoustic signals, and the aforementioned metrics would be used to evaluate its performance.

In addition to these metrics, other performance measures such as F1-score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall), specificity (the ratio of true negatives to the total actual negatives), and area under the ROC curve (a measure of the model's ability to distinguish between classes) might also have been used. However, this information cannot be confirmed based on the provided context.
