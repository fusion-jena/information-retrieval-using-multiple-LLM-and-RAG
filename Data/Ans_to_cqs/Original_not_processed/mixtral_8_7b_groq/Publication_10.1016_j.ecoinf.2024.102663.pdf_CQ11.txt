I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the methods and potential benefits of using deep learning techniques for fish biomass estimation, but it does not specify the data repository or data sharing platforms such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. For more information on the data repository, I would recommend contacting the authors of the research or checking the related publications for additional details.
