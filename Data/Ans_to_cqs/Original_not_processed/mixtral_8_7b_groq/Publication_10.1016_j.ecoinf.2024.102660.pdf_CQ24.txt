The provided context does not directly discuss strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does describe the development and evaluation of a deep learning model called Res_AUNet for water sun glint detection in UAV water images.

In general, there are several strategies that can be used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. One common approach is to set a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This is particularly important in tasks such as model training, where initializing the model with different random weights can lead to different training outcomes. By setting a fixed seed value, researchers can ensure that the same set of random weights is used each time the model is trained, leading to more consistent and reproducible results.

Another strategy for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline is to use techniques such as cross-validation and ensemble methods. Cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into multiple subsets, or folds, and training the model on each fold separately. This can help to reduce overfitting and improve the generalizability of the model. Ensemble methods, on the other hand, involve combining the predictions of multiple models to produce a final output. This can help to reduce the impact of randomness on the final prediction, as the ensemble is less likely to be influenced by the idiosyncrasies of any individual model.

In the context of the Res_AUNet model, it is possible that the researchers employed some of these strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. For example, they may have set a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results, or used cross-validation to reduce overfitting. However, the provided context does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion on this matter.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, there are several common approaches that can be used, such as setting a fixed random seed value, using cross-validation, and employing ensemble methods. It is possible that the researchers who developed the Res_AUNet model employed some of these strategies, but the provided context does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion on this matter.
