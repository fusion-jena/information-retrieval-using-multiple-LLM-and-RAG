Answer:::

The purpose of the deep learning model in the study mentioned in the context is for the recognition of the bluespotted ribbontail ray (Taeniura lymma) species. Specifically, the model is used for classification, as it outperforms traditional classification methods such as SVM, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Sparse Representation Classifier. The deep learning model used in this study is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is fine-tuned for this task.

The authors mention that the CNN outperforms traditional methods in classifying fish species, achieving an average classification rate of more than 90% on the LifeCLEF14 and LifeCLEF15 fish datasets. Furthermore, a very deep CNN with a cross-layer pooling approach was used by Siddiqui et al., (2017) to classify fish species, achieving a classification accuracy of 94.3%.

Therefore, based on the context provided, the deep learning model is used for the classification of the bluespotted ribbontail ray species, and it has shown superior performance compared to traditional classification methods.

It is worth noting that the authors also explore different factors that affect the performance of the model, such as pose handling, data augmentation usage, and feature extraction enhancement. However, the main purpose of the model is for classification.
