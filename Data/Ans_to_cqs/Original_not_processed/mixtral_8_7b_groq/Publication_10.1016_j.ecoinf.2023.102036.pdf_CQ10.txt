I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The context mainly discusses the application of deep learning techniques in ecology, specifically for identifying and classifying individuals based on photographs. It cites various research studies but does not provide any information about the code repository or implementation details. Therefore, I am unable to provide you with the requested link.
