The provided context discusses various studies related to wildfire event prediction in Australia, but it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general techniques that are commonly used to address data bias in machine learning, which could also be applied in deep learning:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the data into subgroups based on certain characteristics (strata) and then ensuring that each subgroup is proportionally represented in both the training and testing sets. This can help to ensure that the model is trained and tested on a representative sample of the data.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances of the minority class in the training data. This can help to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class. However, oversampling can lead to overfitting, so it is important to use techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) that create synthetic examples rather than simply duplicating existing ones.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class in the training data. This can help to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class. However, undersampling can lead to loss of information, so it is important to use techniques such as random undersampling or clustering-based undersampling.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population. This can help to prevent the model from being biased towards a particular subgroup or class.

It is important to note that the choice of technique depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the problem at hand. Therefore, it is essential to perform exploratory data analysis and understand the data before selecting a technique.

In the context of wildfire event prediction, it is important to ensure that the data used to train the model is representative of the environmental conditions before and after wildfires occur. This can help to ensure that the model is able to accurately predict wildfire events based on historical environmental conditions.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, the general techniques mentioned above could be applied to ensure that the model is trained and tested on a representative sample of the data.
