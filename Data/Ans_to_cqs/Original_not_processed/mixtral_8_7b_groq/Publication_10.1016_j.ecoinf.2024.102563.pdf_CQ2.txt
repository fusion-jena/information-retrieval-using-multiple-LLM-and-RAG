Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in ecological informatics primarily uses image data formats.

In the study by Zhang, Zhang, Zhou, Sun, Yang, and Zheng (2023), the deep learning pipeline was used for the identification of land types and tree species in the Engebei ecological demonstration area. The data format used in this study was a high-resolution remote sensing image (GF-1). 

Zhong, Hu, and Zhou (2019) used multi-temporal crop classification based on deep learning. They used remote sensing images from Landsat 8 as the data format. 

Zhu, Yang, Li, Qin, English, Burt, and Zhou (2008) discussed purposive sampling for digital soil mapping for areas with limited data. Although they did not explicitly mention deep learning, their study used raster data formats, which are commonly used in deep learning pipelines. 

Zhu, She, Huang, Zhang, Xu, and Yang (2022) identified soybean based on Sentinel-1/2 SAR and MSI imagery under a complex planting structure. They used remote sensing images from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 as the data format.

Therefore, it can be inferred that the deep learning pipeline in ecological informatics primarily uses image data formats, specifically remote sensing images from various satellites. However, the context does not provide information on the use of other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV in the deep learning pipeline.
