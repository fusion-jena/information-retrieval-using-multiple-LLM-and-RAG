Answer: The provided context discusses the hyper-parameters used in the training of four basic models, including ResNet-50, ViT-S/16, Volo-d1, and ViP-Small/7. However, it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used for each model during the initial training phase. 

However, the context does mention that a deep transfer-learning strategy based on fine-tuning is applied to the basic models. Fine-tuning typically involves initializing the model parameters using a pre-trained model and then adjusting these parameters to better fit the specific task or dataset at hand. This process often involves an optimization technique to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual outputs, commonly referred to as the loss function.

In the context, the specific optimization technique used during the fine-tuning phase is mentioned for the basic models. The optimizer specified is AdamW, which is a variant of the Adam optimizer. AdamW includes weight decay as a regularization technique to prevent overfitting. The learning rate scheduler used is Cosine, which adjusts the learning rate according to a cosine function during the training process.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used during the initial training phase of the basic models, it does specify that the AdamW optimizer with Cosine scheduler is used during the fine-tuning phase of the deep transfer-learning strategy.
