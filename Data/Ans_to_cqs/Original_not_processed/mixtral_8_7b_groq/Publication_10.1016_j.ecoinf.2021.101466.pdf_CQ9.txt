Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the methodology used to develop a two-stage CNN for detecting small objects in images, specifically arthropod species. The authors used YOLOv4 for region proposal and EfficientNet for re-identification. They also proposed a data augmentation method and used IoU as the threshold for positives or negatives. However, there is no mention of where the data repository is available. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
