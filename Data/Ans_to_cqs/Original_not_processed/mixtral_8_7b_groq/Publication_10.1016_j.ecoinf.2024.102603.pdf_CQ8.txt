I'm sorry for the confusion, but the context provided does not include any information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository. The text mainly discusses the differences between deep learning and XGBoost models, instrumental issues in satellite data collection, and the use of machine learning for chlorophyll fluorescence retrieval. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information about the code repository.
