Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, the text does provide details about the specific hyperparameters used for the Random Forest (RF) model, which include the number of random regression trees (ntree), the number of division variables (mtry), and the minimum size of nodes (node size). The number of trees was tested with a range of 20 to 100, while the number of division variables was set to 1/3 of the independent variables, and the minimum size of nodes was set to 5.

For the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models, the context does not provide information on the optimization of their respective hyperparameters. It is possible that the hyperparameters for these models were optimized using methods not specified in the text or that the specific hyperparameters used are not relevant to the study's focus on comparing the overall performance of the three models.

In summary, while the context provides information on specific hyperparameters used for the RF model, it does not explicitly mention the optimization methods used for any of the models' hyperparameters.
