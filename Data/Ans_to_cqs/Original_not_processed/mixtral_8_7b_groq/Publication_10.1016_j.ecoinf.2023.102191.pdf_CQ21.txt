Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the postprocessing steps involved after the model training for the specific monitoring program. However, it can be inferred that some form of data analysis and validation is conducted, as the System Usability Scale (SUS) score is calculated from the responses and open-ended queries.

In the context of machine learning or image recognition models, common postprocessing steps after model training include generating saliency maps, calculating various metrics, and creating confusion matrices. Saliency maps highlight the important features in the input data that the model focuses on for making predictions. Metrics calculation involves assessing the performance of the model using measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predictions made by the model, providing insights into the types of errors it makes.

For the monitoring program, generating saliency maps might help in understanding which species or features are more relevant for the model's predictions. Calculating metrics and creating confusion matrices would allow for evaluating the performance of the model and identifying potential issues or biases in the data.

However, the provided context does not mention any specific postprocessing steps related to the monitoring program. The focus is more on the data collection process, including the use of a dive guide for post-dive debriefing and validation of species sightings. The authors mention the possibility of misidentifying species, but there is no information on how the model handles such cases during postprocessing.

In summary, while common postprocessing steps for machine learning models include generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, and creating confusion matrices, the provided context does not explicitly mention these steps for the monitoring program. It can be inferred that some form of data analysis and validation is conducted, but the specifics remain unclear.
