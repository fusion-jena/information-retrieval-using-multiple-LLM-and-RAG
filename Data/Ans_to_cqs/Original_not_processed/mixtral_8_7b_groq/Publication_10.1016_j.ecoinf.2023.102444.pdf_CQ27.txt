Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) was used for the analysis of bioclimatic variables to estimate species distribution. UMAP is a dimensionality reduction method that helps visualize and understand complex data by reducing it to fewer dimensions while preserving the original data's structure.

The context also mentions that clustering was applied to identify groups containing species and background points, highlighting how bioclimatic heterogeneity between clusters in the reduced dimension translates to geographic regions. This suggests that the results of the UMAP analysis were further processed and analyzed to gain insights into species distribution.

However, the process followed for model serialization, platform selection, or any other steps typically involved in deploying a deep learning model is not provided in the context. Therefore, I cannot give a definitive answer to the query.
