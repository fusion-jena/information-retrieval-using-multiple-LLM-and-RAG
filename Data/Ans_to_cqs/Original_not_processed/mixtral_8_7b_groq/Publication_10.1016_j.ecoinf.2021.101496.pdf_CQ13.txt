Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of an artificial neural network (ANN) to model SPAD values, but it does not explicitly mention the specific hyperparameters used in the model. However, it does mention that the ANN was constructed empirically and that a random number generator was used for numerical optimization.

Based on this information, it can be inferred that the ANN likely used a form of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization, which is a common optimization algorithm for neural networks that uses a random subset of the training data to estimate the gradient of the loss function at each iteration.

As for the learning rate, the context does not provide enough information to determine the specific value used. However, it is mentioned that the ANN was run 100 times, which suggests that some form of learning rate scheduling or adaptation may have been used to prevent the model from getting stuck in a poor local minimum.

Additionally, the context does not mention any hidden layers in the ANN, which suggests that a simple feedforward neural network was used. The input layer contained two nodes, one for each of the two parameters found to be most suitable by linear regression and generalized linear models, and the output layer contained one node for the predicted SPAD value.

Overall, while the specific hyperparameters used in the ANN are not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that the model likely used some form of SGD optimization and may have employed learning rate scheduling or adaptation. The model was constructed empirically and was designed as a simple feedforward neural network with two input nodes and one output node.
