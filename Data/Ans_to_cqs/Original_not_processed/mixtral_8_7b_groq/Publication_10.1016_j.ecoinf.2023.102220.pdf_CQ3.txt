Answer:::
The provided context discusses the use of machine learning methods, including deep learning, for a specific case study, but it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general information about common data annotation techniques used in deep learning, especially for computer vision tasks.

In the context of computer vision, data annotation is the process of labeling images or video frames to provide ground truth information for training deep learning models. Some common data annotation techniques include:

1. Image-level classification: This is the simplest form of annotation, where an image is assigned a single label indicating its overall content (e.g., "dog", "car", "building"). This type of annotation is useful for training image classifiers but does not provide information about the location or extent of objects within the image.

2. Bounding box annotation: In this technique, a bounding box is drawn around an object of interest in an image, providing its location and extent. Bounding box annotations are often used for object detection tasks, where the goal is to locate and classify objects within an image.

3. Semantic segmentation: Semantic segmentation involves labeling each pixel in an image with the class of the object it belongs to. This provides a detailed, pixel-level understanding of object locations and extents. Semantic segmentation is useful for tasks like scene understanding, where it is important to identify and distinguish between different objects and regions within an image.

4. Instance segmentation: Instance segmentation combines object detection and semantic segmentation, providing a unique label for each instance of an object in an image. This technique allows for the identification and tracking of individual objects, even if they overlap or are occluded.

5. Key point annotation: Key point annotation involves identifying and labeling specific points of interest on an object, such as joints on a human body or landmarks on a face. This technique is often used for tasks like human pose estimation or facial recognition.

Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline for the case study likely involved some form of data annotation, but the specific technique is not mentioned. Common data annotation techniques for deep learning include image-level classification, bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and key point annotation. The choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the desired level of detail in the model's understanding of the image content.
