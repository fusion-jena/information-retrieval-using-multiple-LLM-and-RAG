Answer:::

The provided context discusses the training of deep learning (DL) and few-shot learning (FSL) models on various datasets, followed by testing on an independent T2 dataset. However, it does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix generation.

Nonetheless, it can be inferred that metrics calculation is a part of the postprocessing based on the context, as they compare the results of experiments 1 and 2 using unspecified metrics. They might have calculated accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score to compare the performance of the models trained on large and limited datasets.

As for the confusion matrix, it is a common tool for evaluating the performance of classification models. However, the context does not explicitly mention its usage. It is possible that the authors did not include it in their analysis or decided not to mention it in the provided text.

In summary, based on the given context, it can be confirmed that metrics calculation is a postprocessing step, while the inclusion of saliency maps or a confusion matrix is uncertain.
