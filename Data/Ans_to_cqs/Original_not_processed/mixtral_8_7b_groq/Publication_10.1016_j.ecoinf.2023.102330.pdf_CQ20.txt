The context does not provide specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was used for covey call detection. CNNs can be trained using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to accelerate the training process due to their ability to perform parallel computations. Therefore, it is likely that GPUs were used for training the CNN model in this study. However, the context does not explicitly confirm this. Training a deep learning model, such as a CNN, can also be done using Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), which are custom-built chips developed by Google specifically for machine learning tasks. However, there is no mention of TPUs in the context.

In summary, while the context suggests that GPUs were likely used for training the CNN model, it does not provide explicit information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.
