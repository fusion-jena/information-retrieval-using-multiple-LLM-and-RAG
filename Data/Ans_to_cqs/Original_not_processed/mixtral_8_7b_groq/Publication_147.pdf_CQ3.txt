Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), for wetland classification in Alberta, Canada. However, it does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. 

In general, for remote sensing and image processing tasks, data annotation techniques for deep learning can include pixel-level annotation (semantic segmentation), where each pixel in an image is assigned a class label, and object-level annotation (object detection or instance segmentation), where bounding boxes or masks are drawn around individual objects of interest. 

For the specific task of wetland classification, pixel-level annotation (semantic segmentation) would be the most relevant data annotation technique. This is because the goal is to classify each pixel in a remote sensing image into a specific wetland class (e.g., marsh, fen, bog). 

In the context of the study, it is mentioned that CNNs are trained on patch-level data, learning low- and high-level features from the remote sensing data. This suggests that the data annotation process likely involved pixel-wise labeling of wetland classes within these patches. However, the specific data annotation technique is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
