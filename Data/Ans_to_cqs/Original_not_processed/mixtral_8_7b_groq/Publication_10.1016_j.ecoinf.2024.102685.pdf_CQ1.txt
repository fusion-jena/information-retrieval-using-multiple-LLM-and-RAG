Answer:::

The raw data used in the deep learning pipeline for seagrass habitat mapping is collected through field surveys. The surveys were conducted during the summer season of 2010, and the presence or absence, as well as the cover percentage of the three seagrass species, were recorded for each sampling point. This was done by inspecting and sampling the seabed. To minimize the effects of non-vegetated and mixed pixels, points not falling within the region of interest (ROI) and points considered mixed were removed from the dataset. The removed mixed points represented 16.7% of the original data.

The field data collection process is crucial for obtaining accurate and reliable data for training the deep learning models. The use of field surveys allows for the direct observation and measurement of the seagrass habitats, providing a solid foundation for the subsequent data analysis and modeling.

It is important to note that the provided context does not mention the use of any public datasets or sensors in the data collection process. Therefore, it can be concluded that the raw data used in this deep learning pipeline is obtained solely through field surveys.
