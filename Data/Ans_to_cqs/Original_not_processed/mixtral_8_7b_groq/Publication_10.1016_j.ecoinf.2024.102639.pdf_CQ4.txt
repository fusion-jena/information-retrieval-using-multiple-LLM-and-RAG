Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling within the deep learning pipeline. The text focuses on the integration of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithms, along with a Principal Component Analysis-Support Vector Machine (PCA-SVM) hybrid approach, for understanding zebrafish and rat movements within T-maze environments.

However, it is important to note that data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, and scaling are commonly used in deep learning pipelines, particularly for computer vision tasks, to increase the diversity of the training data and improve model robustness. These techniques can include:

1. Flipping: Horizontal or vertical flipping of images to increase the dataset size and help the model generalize better.
2. Rotating: Rotating images by a certain degree to simulate different perspectives and orientations.
3. Scaling: Changing the size of images, either upscaling or downscaling, to help the model handle objects of different scales.

These techniques can be applied to the original dataset before splitting it into training, validation, and testing sets. They can also be applied on-the-fly during training, where random transformations are applied to the input data before feeding them into the model.

In summary, while the provided context does not mention specific data augmentation techniques, they are generally an essential part of deep learning pipelines for computer vision tasks.
