Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipelines discussed utilize image data formats.

In the Vanhoucke and Rabinovich (2015) study, Going deeper with convolutions, the deep learning pipeline involves image data, as the authors focus on improving object detection and image classification by increasing the depth of convolutional neural networks. However, the context does not explicitly mention the specific image format used in their study.

The Tan et al. (2019) study, Mnasnet: Platform-aware neural architecture search for mobile, focuses on optimizing deep learning models for mobile devices. While the paper does not explicitly mention the data formats used, it is likely that image data is used, as computer vision tasks for mobile devices often involve image processing.

The WÃ¤gele et al. (2022) study, Towards a multisensor station for automated biodiversity monitoring, discusses a system for monitoring biodiversity using various sensors. Although the context does not explicitly mention the data formats used, it is mentioned that the system includes cameras for image data collection.

In the Zang et al. (2022) study, the deep learning pipelines involve image data, specifically panda facial images, for age estimation tasks. The authors use VGG nets, which are known for their success in image recognition tasks. They replace the last three Fully-Connected (FC) layers of the original VGG model with one FC layer and adopt Batch Normalization (BN) to accelerate the training of networks.

To summarize, the provided context suggests that image data formats are used in the deep learning pipelines discussed. However, the context does not explicitly mention other data formats such as audio, video, or CSV.
