The provided pieces of context do not contain specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide a general explanation of some common data annotation techniques used in deep learning, especially for computer vision tasks.

Annotation is the process of labeling or marking up data so that machine learning algorithms, like deep learning models, can learn from it. There are various annotation techniques, and the choice of technique depends on the specific task and the desired output. Here are some common data annotation techniques:

1. Image classification: In this technique, annotators label an entire image with a single class or category. For example, annotators may label images as 'cat', 'dog', 'car', or 'building'. This technique is useful for training image classifiers that can predict the category of a new image.

2. Object detection: Object detection involves drawing bounding boxes around objects in an image and labeling each box with the corresponding class. This technique allows deep learning models to localize and classify objects within an image. For example, a model trained with bounding box annotations can detect and count cars in a street scene.

3. Semantic segmentation: Semantic segmentation is a more fine-grained annotation technique that involves labeling each pixel in an image with its corresponding class. This technique allows deep learning models to not only localize and classify objects but also to segment them at the pixel level. For example, a model trained with semantic segmentation annotations can generate a mask that separates the road from the sidewalk in a street scene.

4. Instance segmentation: Instance segmentation is a combination of object detection and semantic segmentation. In this technique, annotators draw bounding boxes around objects and label each pixel within the box with the corresponding class. This technique allows deep learning models to differentiate between individual objects of the same class. For example, a model trained with instance segmentation annotations can count the number of cars and distinguish between different cars in a street scene.

These annotation techniques require a significant amount of manual labor and time. Therefore, there is ongoing research on developing automated and semi-automated annotation tools that can reduce the annotation burden and improve annotation quality.

In summary, the provided pieces of context do not contain specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, common data annotation techniques for deep learning include image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation.
