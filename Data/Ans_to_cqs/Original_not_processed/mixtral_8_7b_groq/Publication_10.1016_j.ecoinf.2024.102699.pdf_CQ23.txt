The text provided discusses the development of a deep learning model for birdsong classification, specifically using Vision Transformers (ViT). While the text does not explicitly mention the methods used for ensuring generalizability such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, it does mention the use of data augmentation techniques.

Data augmentation is a common method used to improve the generalizability of deep learning models. In this case, up to 19 data augmentation techniques were employed, including the integration of various noise samples and non-bird audio elements. These techniques were selected through an iterative process, where only augmentations that enhanced classification performance were kept. The consistent performance improvement across all three deep learning models, when using these augmentation sets, suggests that these techniques helped in increasing the model's generalizability.

Additionally, the authors plan to focus on creating "no-call classifiers" in their future work. These classifiers would be trained on samples that do not contain bird events in general. This approach could help improve the model's ability to generalize to a wider range of real-world scenarios, as it would not be limited to classifying only bird calls.

In summary, while the text does not explicitly mention the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, it does discuss the implementation of data augmentation techniques, which can help improve the generalizability of a deep learning model. Furthermore, the future work on no-call classifiers indicates a continued effort towards improving the model's ability to generalize.
