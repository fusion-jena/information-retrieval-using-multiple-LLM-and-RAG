The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some high spatial resolution satellite image data sources and datasets that are likely used for remote sensing applications.

The MOD09A1 dataset, which is a high spatial resolution satellite image dataset, is used for collecting LAI (Leaf Area Index) data. This dataset is synthesized by selecting the best quality observation surface reflectance of the Terra and Aqua sensors within eight days. The dataset has the same spatial and temporal resolution as the MODIS LAI product and can exclude pixels such as cloud pollution and cloud shadows using QC and state layers.

Additionally, the context mentions Landsat-8, GF-1, and Sentinel-2A as satellite sources for high spatial resolution images. These satellites are likely used for remote sensing applications and can provide data for various deep learning tasks.

Furthermore, the context refers to a study that retrieves the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of riparian forest in the lower basin of Tarim River based on Landsat 8 OLI images. This suggests that Landsat 8 OLI images are used as a data source for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest that high spatial resolution satellite image data sources such as MOD09A1, Landsat-8, GF-1, and Sentinel-2A are likely used for remote sensing applications and can provide data for deep learning tasks.
