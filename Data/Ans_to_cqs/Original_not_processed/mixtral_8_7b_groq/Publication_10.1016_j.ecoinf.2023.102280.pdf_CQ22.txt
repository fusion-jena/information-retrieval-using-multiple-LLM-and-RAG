The provided context discusses the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of noise reduction methods, including a deep learning model called Conformer-Based Metric Generative Adversarial Network (CMGAN). However, it does not explicitly mention standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall. Instead, it introduces three specialized metrics for evaluating noise reduction in audio signals:

1. Signal-to-noise ratio (SnNR): This metric compares the ratio of the sum of the original signal and noise to the noise alone. A higher SnNR indicates better noise reduction.

2. Success ratio (SR): This metric measures the change in variance between the original and denoised signal. A successful denoising process should result in a decrease in variance, leading to a higher SR.

3. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR): This metric calculates the ratio between the maximum signal power and the mean squared error between the original and denoised signal. A higher PSNR indicates better noise reduction.

In summary, the provided context discusses three specialized metrics (SnNR, SR, and PSNR) for evaluating noise reduction in audio signals, but it does not mention standard classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, or recall.
