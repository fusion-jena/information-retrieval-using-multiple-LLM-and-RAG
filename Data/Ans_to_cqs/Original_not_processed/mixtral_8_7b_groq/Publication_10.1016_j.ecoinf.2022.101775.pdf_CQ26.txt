Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of matrix factorization (MF) and deep matrix factorization (DMF) techniques to handle data generated by wireless sensor networks (WSNs) while avoiding bias generated by random data removal. However, it does not explicitly mention the specific preprocessing techniques used to address data bias in the deep learning pipeline.

In general, there are several techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on specific criteria, such as class labels, and then randomly sampling from each subgroup to ensure that each group is represented proportionally in both the training and testing sets.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of instances in the minority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by duplicating instances or using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to generate synthetic instances.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of instances in the majority class to balance the dataset. This can be done by randomly selecting a subset of instances or using techniques such as Tomek's Links to remove instances that are close to the boundary between classes.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves collecting data from a variety of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population. This can help to reduce bias and improve the generalizability of the model.

In the context of the provided text, the authors mention the use of a validation set during training to check for overfitting. They also mention the use of a min-max scaler to compute performance metrics in the test set. However, they do not explicitly mention any of the above techniques to address data bias during preprocessing. It is possible that they used one or more of these techniques, but this information is not provided in the text.

In summary, while the provided context discusses techniques for handling data generated by WSNs in the context of deep learning, it does not explicitly mention the specific preprocessing techniques used to address data bias. There are several techniques commonly used for this purpose, including stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection.
