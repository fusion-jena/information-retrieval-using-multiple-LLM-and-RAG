I don't have enough information to provide specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model for the given context. The text provided lists various statistical models and methods used in analyzing human-wildlife conflicts, but it does not mention any deep learning models or their hyperparameters.

Deep learning models typically have several hyperparameters that need to be tuned for optimal performance. Some common hyperparameters include:

1. Learning rate: The step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function.
2. Optimizer: An algorithm used to update the weights and biases in the model based on the gradient of the loss function. Examples include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adagrad, Adadelta, Adam, and RMSprop.
3. Number of layers and neurons: The architecture of the deep learning model, including the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer.
4. Activation functions: Functions applied to the output of each neuron, such as ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh.
5. Regularization techniques and parameters: Methods to prevent overfitting, such as L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, or early stopping.
6. Batch size: The number of samples processed before updating the model's weights.

To determine the specific hyperparameters used in a deep learning model for the given context, additional information would be required, such as the type of deep learning model used, the dataset and problem statement, and any relevant code or configuration files.
