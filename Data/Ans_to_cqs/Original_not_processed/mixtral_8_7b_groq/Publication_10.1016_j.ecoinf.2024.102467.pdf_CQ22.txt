The performance of the deep learning model for marine zoobenthos recognition is evaluated using several metrics, including precision (P), recall (R), harmonic mean of P and R (F1), and mean average precision (mAP).

Precision (P) is the ratio of true positive (TP) predictions to the total number of positive predictions. It measures the proportion of correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model. The formula for calculating precision is:

P = TP / (Tp + FP) × 100%

Recall (R) is the ratio of true positive (TP) predictions to the total number of actual positive instances. It measures the proportion of correct positive predictions out of all actual positive instances. The formula for calculating recall is:

R = TP / (Tp + FN) × 100%

F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, which provides a balanced measure of both. The formula for calculating F1 score is:

F1 = 2PR / (P + R)

Mean average precision (mAP) is a metric used for evaluating the performance of object detection models. It is the average precision calculated for each class, and then the mean of all the average precisions is calculated. The formula for calculating mAP is:

mAP = 1/n ∑n i APi

In addition to these metrics, the model complexity of the marine zoobenthos recognition algorithm is evaluated using model file size, parameters, FLOPs (floating-point operations per second), inference time, model computation time, and computational resource consumption.

The EfficientNetV2 network is used as the backbone for the deep learning model, which is an efficient, lightweight feature extraction network. It reduces the number of parameters and computations while preserving the accuracy of the model, leading to significant decreases in model training and inference duration. Furthermore, it uses an improved progressive learning approach that dynamically adjusts the regularization method based on the training image size, which can improve the training speed and accuracy of the network. The experimental results show that the training speed is increased by 11 times, and the number of parameters is reduced by 1/6.8. This network design helps in improving the training speed of the model while ensuring detection accuracy and speed. The algorithm's inference time on RTX 3060 is shortened by 54%, indicating that it is lightweight, achieves an accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods, and is more suitable for marine zoobenthos recognition tasks.
