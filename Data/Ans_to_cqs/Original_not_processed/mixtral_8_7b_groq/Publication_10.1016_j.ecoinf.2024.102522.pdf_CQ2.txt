The provided context does not directly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss various datasets used in ecological studies, which can give us an idea of the possible data formats.

Answer:::
The ecological studies mentioned in the context use various datasets, which can be inferred to be in different data formats. For instance, the studies use nighttime light images for Taihu Lake Basin and population simulation based on NPP/VIIRS night light. These most likely involve raster image formats such as GeoTIFF or JPEG. Another study models anthropogenic fire occurrence using logistic regression and random forests, which might involve vector data formats like Shapefile or GeoJSON for geographical data and CSV for tabular data. The MODIS 500 Meter Global Vegetation Continuous Field Products likely come in a grid or raster format. Lastly, the study on spatial distribution of population based on nighttime light and LUC data in the Sichuan-Chongqing Region might use vector data formats for geographical data and CSV for tabular data.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline for ecological studies may involve various data formats, including raster image formats (e.g., GeoTIFF, JPEG), vector data formats (e.g., Shapefile, GeoJSON), and tabular data formats (e.g., CSV).
