Answer:::

I am unable to provide the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline because it is not included in the provided context. The context includes information about a study related to ecological informatics and biofilm bubbles, as well as details about the Vaki River Watcher sites and the VGG16 CNN architecture used in the study. However, there is no mention of a code repository or where it might be located. I can provide you with the DOI of the paper, so you can look for the code repository link in the published paper or contact the authors for more information.

DOI: 10.1016/j.ecoinf.2022.101817
