Based on the information provided, there is no explicit mention of how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized. The text does not specify whether techniques such as grid search, random search, or any other method were used for tuning the hyperparameters of the GLM, MaxEnt, RF, GBM, and MARS models.

However, it is mentioned that five component models were used, and the Random Forest (RF) model demonstrated the best performance. It can be inferred that some form of model optimization might have been carried out for the Random Forest model, but the specifics are not provided.

In general, model hyperparameters can significantly impact the performance of machine learning algorithms. Therefore, it is common practice to optimize these hyperparameters using techniques such as grid search, random search, Bayesian optimization, or others. These methods involve systematically searching through a range of possible hyperparameter values to find the set that yields the best model performance.

Without more information from the text, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer on how the hyperparameters of the models were optimized.
