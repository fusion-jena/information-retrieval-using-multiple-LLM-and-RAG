Answer:::
The text provided does not give specific information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. However, it does discuss the performance of predictive models in the context of training with weakly-labeled data for global vegetation cover.

When using only complete targets for training, the model has the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for complete observations in the test set. However, when evaluating the prediction accuracy of dominant vegetation cover types, using this approach results in a prediction accuracy of incomplete observations that is more than 10% less than when using other approaches. This suggests that complete observations do not carry full information about the distribution of natural vegetation cover worldwide.

The authors argue that better performance can be achieved if incompletely labeled data is used in model training instead of discarding it. This implies that the model performance is evaluated not only on the complete observations but also on the incomplete observations.

In summary, while the text does not provide explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training, it suggests that the model performance is evaluated on both complete and incomplete observations during training.
