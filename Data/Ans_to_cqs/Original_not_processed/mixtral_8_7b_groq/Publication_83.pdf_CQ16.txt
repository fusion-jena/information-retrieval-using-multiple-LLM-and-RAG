Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete for the CNN model. However, it is mentioned that the model is trained with 200 epochs using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross entropy as the loss function.

In general, there are several common methods to determine when training should be stopped, including:

1. Validation loss plateau: Training is stopped when the validation loss stops decreasing or starts increasing, indicating that the model is starting to overfit to the training data.
2. Early stopping: Training is stopped when the validation loss does not improve for a certain number of epochs.
3. Monitoring other metrics: Training can also be stopped based on other metrics, such as accuracy or F1 score, if they reach a certain threshold or stop improving.

Given that the context mentions the use of cross-validation and reporting of an averaged classification result, it is possible that the training process involved some form of early stopping or validation loss monitoring. However, without further information, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
