Answer:::

The provided pieces of context do not contain information about the specific deep learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) used to build the model. The context focuses on the importance of valve gape in bivalves and its link to key metabolic functions, as well as the potential of using big-data on valve gape for improving predictions in aquaculture. There are references to various studies related to the topic, but none of them mention the use of specific deep learning frameworks. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to answer this query.
