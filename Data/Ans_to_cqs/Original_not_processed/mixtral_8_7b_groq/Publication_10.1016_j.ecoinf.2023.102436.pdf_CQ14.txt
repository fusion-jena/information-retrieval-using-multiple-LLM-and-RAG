Based on the provided context, there is no information suggesting that any hyperparameters of the model were optimized using methods such as grid search or random search. The text describes the creation of a restorative potential map using a mathematical model, but it does not mention any process for tuning the parameters of this model.

The model appears to involve calculating a restorative potential score for each grid in the study area, based on normalized values for various metrics and weights determined by regression analysis. These scores are then aggregated and interpolated to create a restorative potential map for the entire terrain. However, the process for determining these weights and normalizing the metrics is explained, while the optimization of hyperparameters is not.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the provided context does not contain information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized.
