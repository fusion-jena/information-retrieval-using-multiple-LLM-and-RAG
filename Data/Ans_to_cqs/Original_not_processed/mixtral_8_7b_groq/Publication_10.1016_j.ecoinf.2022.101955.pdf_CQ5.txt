Answer:::

The provided pieces of context do not mention any specific use of deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or deep neural networks. The mentioned machine learning algorithms include k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), but none of them are deep learning models.

The datasets used in the studies mentioned in the context are related to land use and land cover (LULC) classification using remote sensing data. These datasets include satellite image data from Landsat and SPOT-5 HRG imagery. The LULC classes used in these studies include croplands, dense forest, grassland savanna, open savanna/barelands, built-up areas, water bodies, wetlands, and woody savanna.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the specific datasets used in deep learning pipelines such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
