The context does not provide detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention that a deep convolutional neural network was used to fuse GEDI and Sentinel-2 images to create Lang10m, a high-resolution CHM of the Earth at 10 m resolution. The network was trained using Sentinel-2 optical images and a deep learning approach.

It can be inferred that the deep learning model was likely serialized, which means that the model's architecture, weights, and biases were saved to disk after training. Serialization allows the model to be loaded and used for making predictions on new data without having to retrain the model.

As for platform selection, the context does not provide information on where the model was deployed. However, it does mention that Google Images were used as background images in one study, which suggests that some of the work was done using Google's cloud infrastructure.

In summary, while the context does not provide detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, it can be inferred that the model was likely serialized and may have been deployed on a cloud platform.
