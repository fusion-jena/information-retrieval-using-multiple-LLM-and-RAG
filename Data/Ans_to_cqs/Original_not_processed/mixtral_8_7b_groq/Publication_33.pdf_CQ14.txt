Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific details about how the hyperparameters of the model, apart from the risk threshold τi, are optimized. There is no mention of methods such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization techniques.

However, the text does mention a two-phase process for training and tuning the model. In the first phase, a classification model is built by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a given database T0. This implies that the hyperparameters related to the CNN, such as the number of layers, number of neurons, learning rate, etc., are optimized during this phase. However, the method used for this optimization is not specified.

In the second phase, a risk threshold τi specific to each class is tuned using a second and independent database T1. This is done to transform the 2 classification options (correct, wrong) into 3 options by applying certain equations. This process could be seen as a form of hyperparameter optimization, as the risk threshold is being tuned to improve the model's performance. However, the method used to tune this threshold is also not specified.

Therefore, while the text does mention a two-phase process for training and tuning the model, it does not provide specific details about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
