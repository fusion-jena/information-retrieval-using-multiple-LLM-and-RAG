Answer:::
Unfortunately, there is no code repository link provided in the given context. The text describes various applications of deep learning for image processing and classification in the context of remote sensing, specifically for the classification of vegetation and physiognomies in the Brazilian Savanna. However, it does not provide a link to a code repository or any information on how to access the code used in these studies. It is common for research papers to not include code repository links, so it is possible that the code for these studies is not publicly available.
