Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of which specific deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, were used to build the model. The text focuses on describing the methodology, modifications, and limitations of the model, but it does not specify the tools or software used for its implementation. Therefore, I cannot provide an accurate answer to this question.
