Answer:::
The specific deep learning framework used to build the model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is indicated that the model used pretrained weights from the COCO dataset provided by Redmon & Farhadi (2018). This suggests that the model could have been built using a framework compatible with these pretrained weights, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. TensorFlow is also mentioned in the context, but only as a library for implementing machine learning algorithms and not specifically as the framework used for building the deep learning model in question. Therefore, while it is possible that TensorFlow was used, it is not explicitly stated, and PyTorch or another compatible framework could also have been used.
