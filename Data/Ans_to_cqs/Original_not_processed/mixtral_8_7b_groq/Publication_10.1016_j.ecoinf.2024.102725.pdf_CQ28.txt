The provided context does not explicitly mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. However, it is stated that the data was obtained from the Google Earth Engine platform, and pre-processing steps such as mosaicking and clipping were performed. However, this does not necessarily mean that the deep learning model was deployed on the Google Cloud Platform. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the given context.
