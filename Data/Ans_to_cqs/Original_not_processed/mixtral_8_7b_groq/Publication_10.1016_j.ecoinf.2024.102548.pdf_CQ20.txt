Answer:::
The deep learning model's training process involves the use of GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) acceleration. This is mentioned in the context when discussing the experimental setup where GPU acceleration was utilized to speed up computations. GPU acceleration is a common approach in deep learning training due to its ability to handle parallel computations efficiently, which is particularly beneficial for the matrix and vector operations inherent in deep learning models. However, the text does not mention the use of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), which are another type of hardware resource specifically designed for machine learning tasks. Therefore, based on the provided context, we can conclude that GPU acceleration is used for training the deep learning model.
