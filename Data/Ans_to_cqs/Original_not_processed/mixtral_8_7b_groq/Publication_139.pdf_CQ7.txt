Answer:

The context provided does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into train, test, and validation sets. However, it does mention that five prediction records were generated for each of the five training folds, which suggests that cross-validation may have been used. Cross-validation involves splitting the data into k folds, where k-1 folds are used for training and one fold is used for testing. This process is repeated k times, with a different fold used for testing each time. The results are then averaged to get a more robust estimate of the model's performance.

Additionally, the context mentions that pre-training on ResNet50 and Inception neural networks did not meaningfully improve classification performance, and a simpler architecture was used instead. This suggests that some form of model selection or hyperparameter tuning may have been performed, which would also require a separate test set to evaluate the final model's performance.

Overall, while the specific criteria for splitting the data are not mentioned, it is likely that some form of cross-validation or model selection was used, which would require a separate test set to evaluate the final model's performance.
