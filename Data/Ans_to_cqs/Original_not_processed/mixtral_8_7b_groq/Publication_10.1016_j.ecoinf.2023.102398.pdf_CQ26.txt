The provided context does not include specific information about the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the dataset used for custom training is "sufficiently large" and that the deep learning (DL) model is tuned with optimized hyperparameters to prevent overfitting and underfitting situations. This suggests that some measures were taken to ensure the quality and representativeness of the training data.

In general, there are several techniques that can be used to address data bias during preprocessing, including:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into subgroups based on certain characteristics (e.g., class labels) and then ensuring that each subgroup is represented proportionally in the training and testing sets. This can help to ensure that the model is exposed to a diverse range of examples and is not biased towards any particular subgroup.
2. Oversampling: This technique involves increasing the number of examples from underrepresented subgroups in the dataset. This can help to ensure that the model has enough exposure to these subgroups and is not biased towards the majority subgroups.
3. Undersampling: This technique involves reducing the number of examples from overrepresented subgroups in the dataset. This can help to reduce the impact of any bias that may be present in these subgroups and ensure that the model is exposed to a more diverse range of examples.
4. Diverse data collection: This technique involves making a concerted effort to collect data from a wide range of sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the population of interest. This can help to reduce the risk of bias and ensure that the model is able to generalize well to new, unseen data.

It is important to note that these techniques are not mutually exclusive and can be used in combination to address data bias during preprocessing. Additionally, it is important to carefully consider the characteristics of the dataset and the problem at hand when deciding which techniques to use.
