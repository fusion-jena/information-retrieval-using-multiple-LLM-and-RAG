Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention which frameworks were used to build the deep learning model for the research on groundwater-climate interactions in the Great Artesian Basin (GAB). The article focuses on discussing the research's objectives, methodology, and results.

The abstract mentions using "data (t) = âˆ‘n j=1 cjsj (1)" as a formula for the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). However, this formula is not related to the deep learning frameworks.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which frameworks were used to build the deep learning model.
