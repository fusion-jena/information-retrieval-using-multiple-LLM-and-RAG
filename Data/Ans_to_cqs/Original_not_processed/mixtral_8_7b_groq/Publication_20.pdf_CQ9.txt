Answer:::

The text provided does not give information about where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available. It mentions that the architecture details can be found in a depository, but it does not specify the name or URL of the depository. Additionally, it describes the process of building the training datasets using raw fish species data, but it does not provide a link to this raw data or indicate where it can be found. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
