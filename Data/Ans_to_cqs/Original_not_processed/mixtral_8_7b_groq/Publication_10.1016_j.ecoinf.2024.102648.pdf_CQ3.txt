The provided context does not include specific information about the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the study employed deep learning (artificial neural network) models to forecast the percent disease incidence of Cotton Leaf Curl Disease (CLCuD) using various weather parameters and whitefly data. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data annotation techniques used in this particular deep learning pipeline likely involve labeling or annotating the weather parameters and whitefly data in a way that can be used for training the deep learning model.

In general, data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines can include:

1. Image annotation: This involves labeling objects or regions of interest in images, such as using bounding boxes or instance segmentation to identify specific objects or parts of objects.
2. Text annotation: This involves labeling or tagging text data, such as assigning categories or sentiment scores to text documents or social media posts.
3. Time series annotation: This involves labeling or tagging time series data, such as identifying specific events or patterns in sensor data or financial time series.
4. Audio annotation: This involves labeling or tagging audio data, such as identifying specific sounds or speech patterns in audio recordings.

The specific data annotation technique used will depend on the type of data being analyzed and the goals of the deep learning model. In the context of the study mentioned, it is likely that the weather parameters and whitefly data were annotated with labels indicating the presence or absence of CLCuD, as well as any relevant metadata (such as the date and location of the data). However, the specific data annotation technique used is not mentioned in the provided context.
