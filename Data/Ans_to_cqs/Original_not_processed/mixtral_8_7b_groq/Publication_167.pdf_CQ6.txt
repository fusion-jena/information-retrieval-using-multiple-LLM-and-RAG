Answer:::

In the context provided, the preprocessing step involved before training a deep learning model is batch normalization. Batch normalization is a technique used to normalize the input data in deep learning models. It is applied to each channel of the input data in a mini-batch, where the mean and variance of each channel are calculated, and the input is normalized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. After normalization, the scale parameter gamma and shift parameter beta are applied to the normalized output to obtain the final output.

In the given paper, the input data are 40-dimensional data, and due to the large time span and large land area in the training data, there are significant differences in the distribution between different batches of training data. Therefore, batch normalization is performed on the input data to reduce the distribution differences between different batches of training data and between the training set and the test set.

It is worth noting that other preprocessing steps such as data cleaning, scaling, and feature engineering may also be involved in the preprocessing stage before training a deep learning model. However, the context provided does not mention any other preprocessing steps.

In summary, the preprocessing step involved before training a deep learning model in the given context is batch normalization, which is used to normalize the input data and reduce the distribution differences between different batches of training data and between the training set and the test set.
