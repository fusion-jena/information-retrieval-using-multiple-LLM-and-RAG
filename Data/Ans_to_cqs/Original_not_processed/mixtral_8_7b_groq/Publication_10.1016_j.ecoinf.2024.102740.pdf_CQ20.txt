Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. However, it is mentioned that Machine Learning (ML), which includes deep learning, techniques were used for the generation of accurate and dynamic information on grassland attributes. Moreover, the Random Forest (RF) ML technique was employed using the System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA) software.

It is common practice to use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) for training deep learning models due to their ability to perform parallel processing, which significantly speeds up the training process compared to using Central Processing Units (CPUs). However, the context does not provide information on whether GPUs or any other specialized hardware was used for deep learning model training.

Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to accurately answer the query regarding the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model.
