The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific framework used to build the deep learning model for predicting air quality. The articles discuss various methods and techniques for predicting air pollution levels using deep learning models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and real-time ensemble predictions. However, they do not specify the framework or library used to implement these models.

Common deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Theano. TensorFlow, developed by Google Brain, and PyTorch, developed by Facebook's AI Research lab, are two of the most popular open-source frameworks for building and training deep learning models. Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. Theano was a popular Python library for highly optimized numerical computations, but it is no longer being developed.

Considering the publication years of the articles, it is likely that TensorFlow or Theano were used, as PyTorch was released in 2016, and its popularity grew significantly in recent years. Nonetheless, without explicit information in the provided context, it is impossible to determine the specific framework used to build the deep learning models for air quality prediction.
