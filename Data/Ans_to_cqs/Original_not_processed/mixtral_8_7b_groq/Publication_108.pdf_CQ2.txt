Answer:::

The deep learning pipeline in this particular case study uses high-resolution orthophotos as the primary data format. Orthophotos are aerial photographs that have been geometrically corrected to remove distortions caused by camera tilt, lens distortion, and relief displacement, resulting in a map-like image where each pixel represents the same ground area. This format is suitable for the task at hand, which involves object detection and classification in forestry, as it provides high-resolution spatial information.

The orthophotos are processed into relatively small labeled tiles (or image cubes) of 256 Ã— 256 pixels due to the size of the original images and memory limitations during computations. These labeled tiles consist of both the image data and corresponding labels, which are used for training, validating, and testing the convolutional neural network (CNN).

The data is split into three datasets: training, validation, and test. The training dataset is used for optimizing the neural network, while the validation dataset is used to assess the performance during the training process. The test dataset is used to evaluate the performance of the final optimized neural network.

In summary, the deep learning pipeline in this case study uses high-resolution orthophotos as the primary data format, which are processed into labeled tiles for training, validating, and testing the CNN. Other data formats, such as audio, video, or CSV, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
