Unfortunately, the provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used for the automatic recognition of woody regrowth vegetation in repeat landscape photographs. The sources mentioned in the context describe the research and applications of various methods for evaluating and analyzing landscape visual quality, but they do not provide information about the code repository. It is possible that the authors have not made the code publicly available, or it may be hosted on a different platform. Therefore, I am unable to provide the location of the code repository based on the given context.
