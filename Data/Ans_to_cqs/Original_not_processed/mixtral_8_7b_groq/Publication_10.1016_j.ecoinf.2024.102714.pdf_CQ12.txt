Answer:::

The provided context does not specify the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions the use of a Python implementation of the XGBoostClassifier, which is a gradient boosting algorithm and not a deep learning model. Deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Transformers are different types of neural networks with multiple layers that can learn complex patterns and representations from data. However, the XGBoostClassifier used in this study is a decision-tree-based ensemble model that uses a gradient boosting algorithm to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the model. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
