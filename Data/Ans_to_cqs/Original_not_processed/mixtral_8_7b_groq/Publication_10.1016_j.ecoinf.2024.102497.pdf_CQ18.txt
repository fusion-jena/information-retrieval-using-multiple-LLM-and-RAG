Answer: During the training of both the Random Forest Regression (RFR) and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) models for nearshore bathymetry studies, a strategy was implemented to monitor and ensure the performance of the models.

For the RFR model, the performance was monitored by fine-tuning the model parameters. These parameters, such as 'n_estimators', 'max_depth', 'min_samples_split', 'min_samples_leaf', and 'max_features', were carefully selected to minimize the variance of the target variable within each subset. This iterative process employed a greedy algorithm, gradually building the tree until specific stopping conditions were met. By optimizing these parameters, the RFR model's noise resilience was enhanced, and the risk of overfitting was reduced, ultimately improving the accuracy of predicting water depths in nearshore bathymetry studies.

In the case of the CART model, monitoring its performance involved fine-tuning specific model parameters for efficiency and suitability. The parameters 'max_depth', 'min_samples_leaf', and 'max_leaf_nodes' were adjusted to prevent overfitting and minimize cross-validation error. These optimized values allowed the CART model to effectively estimate bathymetry and analyze vertical water environment information in coastal regions.

Moreover, to further assess and monitor the performance of both models, cross-validation techniques were employed. Cross-validation is a statistical method used to estimate the skill of machine learning models by dividing the dataset into subsets or folds. The model is then trained on a subset of the data and tested on the remaining portions. This process is repeated for each subset, providing an average model skill score and a measure of the model's performance and robustness.

In summary, the strategy to monitor the performance of the RFR and CART models during training involved fine-tuning model parameters, employing a greedy algorithm for RFR and adjusting key parameters for CART, and utilizing cross-validation techniques to estimate model skill and robustness. These measures ensured that the models performed optimally and provided accurate predictions for nearshore bathymetry studies.
