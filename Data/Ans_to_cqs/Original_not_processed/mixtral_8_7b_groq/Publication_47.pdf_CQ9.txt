Answer:::

The specific data repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the evaluation of the conservation status of Orchidaceae species has not been explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is noted that the study utilized digitally available occurrence records for orchid species. Common data repositories for such records include Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the Botanical Information and Ecology Network (BIEN). It is possible that the data was sourced from one of these platforms, but without further information, it cannot be confirmed. Additionally, the authors have made the R package IUCNN available on GitHub at <https://github.com/azizka/IUCNN>, which may contain information on the data source or how to access it.
