Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the specific postprocessing steps applied after the model training process. However, it does mention the use of Average Precision (AP) as an evaluation metric, which is calculated by determining the area under the precision-recall curve at different thresholds.

In general, postprocessing steps in machine learning models can include:

1. Metrics calculation: This involves calculating various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix, to assess the performance of the model.
2. Generating saliency maps: Saliency maps are visualizations that highlight the important features in the input data that contribute to the model's predictions. These maps can help in interpreting the model's decision-making process.
3. Model calibration: Model calibration refers to adjusting the model's output probabilities to better match the true probabilities of the classes.
4. Hyperparameter tuning: Postprocessing can also involve fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the model to optimize its performance.
5. Model compression: This step involves reducing the model's size or complexity to make it more computationally efficient or suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Considering the context provided, it is likely that the postprocessing steps involved after the model training process include calculating evaluation metrics, such as Average Precision, and possibly generating visualizations like saliency maps to aid in interpreting the model's performance. However, the context does not explicitly mention these steps, so it is not possible to provide a definitive answer.
