The text provided does not give a direct answer to the query regarding strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of different models and ensemble techniques for plant species identification.

In the context of deep learning, randomness can be introduced in various stages of the pipeline, such as the initialization of weights in the neural network, data shuffling, and dropout regularization. A common way to control this randomness is by setting a seed value, which ensures reproducibility of the results.

In the given text, there is no explicit mention of the use of a seed value to handle randomness. However, it does describe the use of different models and ensemble techniques for plant species identification. Specifically, it mentions the use of GoogleNet, ResNet, and ResNeXT models with different configurations, as well as the ensembling of results from GoogleNet and VGG networks, and a bagging ensemble of three ResNet152-layered CNN networks.

Ensemble techniques, such as bagging and stacking, can help reduce the impact of randomness in the deep learning pipeline by combining the predictions of multiple models. Bagging involves creating multiple subsets of the training data with replacement, training a model on each subset, and combining the predictions. Stacking involves training multiple models on the same training data and combining their predictions using a meta-learner.

In summary, while the text does not provide a direct answer to the query regarding strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of different models and ensemble techniques for plant species identification. Ensemble techniques, such as bagging and stacking, can help reduce the impact of randomness by combining the predictions of multiple models. However, the use of a seed value to control randomness is not explicitly mentioned in the text.
