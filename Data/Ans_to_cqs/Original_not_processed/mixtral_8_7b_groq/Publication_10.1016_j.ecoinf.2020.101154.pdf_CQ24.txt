The provided context discusses the data splitting approach and hyperparameter tuning in the context of machine learning and growth modeling for herring populations, but it does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline using a random seed value.

However, the concept of randomness is inherent in the data splitting approach used in the study. Specifically, individual observations were grouped according to year of capture, and years were randomly selected for inclusion in the train and test datasets. This approach introduces some systematic differences between the test and train datasets but ensures that the model is tested using previously unseen combinations of explanatory variables, providing a more robust test of model performance.

In addition, hyperparameter tuning was done manually, with the learning rate set as low as possible and the number of iterations as high as computationally feasible. The learning rate, also called a shrinkage parameter, determines the contribution of each tree to the model. The maximum tree depth, which reflects the degree of interaction in the model, is usually low, and GBRT performs best using fairly shallow trees, so-called tree stumps. These hyperparameters can affect the model's performance and may require tuning to optimize the model's predictive accuracy.

While the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline using a random seed value, the concept of randomness is discussed in the context of data splitting and hyperparameter tuning. A random seed value can be used in a deep learning pipeline to ensure reproducibility and consistency in the training and testing of machine learning models. By setting a fixed random seed value, researchers can ensure that the same random samples are selected for training and testing, allowing for more reliable comparisons of model performance.
