The provided context does not directly discuss data bias techniques during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some techniques related to data preprocessing and model selection in various studies.

In the context of Eng. 82, 35-45, Kavitha et al. (2023) use a filter-based ensemble feature selection method for intrusion detection in cloud computing. Although not directly related to data bias, feature selection techniques can help reduce bias by ensuring relevant features are considered in the model.

In Kumar and Jain (2010), ARIMA forecasting of ambient air pollutants (O3, NO, NO2, and CO) is discussed. While not explicitly mentioning data bias techniques, the study emphasizes the importance of selecting appropriate models based on the data's characteristics.

Lawin et al. (2017) use exhaled carbon monoxide as a non-invasive biomarker of short-term exposure to outdoor air pollution. The study collects diverse data from various sources, which can help reduce bias by ensuring a more representative sample.

In Singh et al. (2023), the authors review the utilization of machine learning in nanofluids, solar energy generation, and the prognosis of solar power. While not directly discussing data bias techniques, the study highlights the importance of diverse data collection for accurate model predictions.

Regarding deep learning methods, the context discusses SLSTM and SGRU models for time-series prediction. However, it does not mention any specific data bias techniques used during preprocessing.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly answer the query, it does suggest that appropriate model selection, feature selection, and diverse data collection can help reduce data bias during the deep learning pipeline preprocessing. Other techniques, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling, are not mentioned in the provided context.
