Based on the provided context, the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in the work being discussed are not explicitly stated. However, it can be inferred that one possible criterion used may be a validation loss plateau.

The context states that the performance of the model was verified by comparing it with five other models, and each model was trained. The results of this training are illustrated in Figure 11, which shows the loss rate and accuracy during training and testing. It can be inferred that the training process involved monitoring the loss rate and accuracy over time, and the training was likely stopped when the loss rate reached a plateau or when the accuracy was no longer improving.

Additionally, the context mentions that the proposed model is stable, with reasonably smooth curves and small fluctuations during training and testing. This suggests that the training process was well-regulated and that the model was able to converge to a stable solution.

Overall, while the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete are not explicitly stated in the provided context, it can be inferred that a validation loss plateau may have been one of the criteria used.
