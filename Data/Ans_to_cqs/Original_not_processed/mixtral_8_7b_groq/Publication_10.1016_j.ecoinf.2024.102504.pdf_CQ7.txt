Based on the provided context, there are no specific criteria mentioned for splitting the data when training deep learning models for air quality prediction. However, there are some general practices followed in machine learning and deep learning for splitting the data into training, validation, and testing sets.

In the Navares and Aznarte (2020) study, they used LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for predicting air quality, but they did not mention the criteria for splitting the data. Similarly, in the Neckel et al. (2023) study, they used self-made passive samplers and Sentinel-3b SYN satellite images for air pollution analysis in Budapest, but they did not discuss the data splitting approach.

In the Ogen (2020) study, the author assessed nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels as a contributing factor to coronavirus (COVID-19) fatality, but the data splitting method was not mentioned. The same applies to the Pandey (2020) study, where fly ash deposits were considered as a potential sink for carbon sequestration.

In the Pope et al. study, they analyzed the health risks of two major European outdoor air pollutants, PM and NO2, but they did not discuss the data splitting approach for machine learning models.

In the Chianese et al. (2019) study, the authors used a multi-layer perceptron for predicting ambient particulate matter concentration, but they did not mention the criteria for splitting the data.

In summary, the provided context does not offer specific criteria for splitting data for deep learning model training in air quality research. However, common practices for splitting data in machine learning and deep learning include:

1. Train-Test Split: The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set, typically using an 80-20 or 70-30 ratio. The training set is used to train the model, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

2. Train-Validation-Test Split: The dataset is divided into three subsets: a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

3. K-Fold Cross-Validation: The dataset is divided into 'k' subsets or folds. The model is trained 'k' times, each time using a different fold as the validation set and the remaining 'k-1' folds as the training set. The average performance across the 'k' runs is used as the final performance metric.

Answer:::

Although the provided context does not mention specific criteria for splitting data for deep learning model training in air quality research, common practices include train-test split, train-validation-test split, and k-fold cross-validation. These methods help ensure the model's generalization ability and prevent overfitting.
