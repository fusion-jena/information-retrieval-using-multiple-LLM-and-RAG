Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about postprocessing steps involved after the model training, such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. However, the text does mention some modifications and improvements that can be made to the model.

Answer:::
The model's limitations as a classification model are discussed, pointing out the need for extensive computational resources and a sufficient number of tests to achieve reliable estimates. Strategies for improving the model include modifying the update criterion to make it differentiable and suitable for machine-learning tools, optimizing the scope by adjusting partitions, and investigating variance-reduction strategies.

However, these modifications and improvements are mainly focused on the model's training process rather than postprocessing steps.

Answer:::
In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention postprocessing steps like Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix, it does discuss strategies for improving the model's training process. These strategies include modifying the update criterion, optimizing the scope, and investigating variance-reduction techniques.
