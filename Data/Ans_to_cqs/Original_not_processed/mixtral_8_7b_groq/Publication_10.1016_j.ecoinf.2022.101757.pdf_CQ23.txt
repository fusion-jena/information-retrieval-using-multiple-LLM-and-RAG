Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it is mentioned that the Deep Learning model used in this study is a pre-trained implementation of DeeplabV3+ with the COCO dataset. The COCO dataset is a diverse dataset with 121,408 images and a total of 883,331 object annotations divided into 184 classes. Using such a widely used and well-established dataset to train the model sets a baseline to benchmark its performance and ensures the model's generalizability to some extent.

However, the context does not explicitly mention any other measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, or using a diverse dataset. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance and generalizability of a machine learning model by dividing the dataset into multiple subsets and training and testing the model on each subset. Stratified splitting is a method of splitting a dataset into training and testing sets while preserving the distribution of classes in each set, which can help ensure that the model performs well on all classes.

Therefore, while the use of the COCO dataset contributes to the generalizability of the model, it would have been beneficial to have more information on whether additional measures such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to further ensure the model's ability to perform well on new, unseen data.
