Answer:::

The provided context discusses the use of two primary data formats in a geospatial data analysis pipeline, particularly for studying forest fires in a specific region. These data formats are high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite images and Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format.

The Sentinel-2 satellite images are used to generate detailed land use and land cover data for the Panhandle area in Florida, USA. These images are incorporated into a cloud platform and then processed using machine learning techniques for classifying fire-damaged monuments. This demonstrates the platform's ability to identify minor fires successfully.

On the other hand, the Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format is used to store and manage data retrieved through the Direct Application Programming Interface (API) in Python. This data pertains to forest fire point information in the study area. The CSV format aids in organizing and saving the obtained data on Google Drive for further calculations and examination.

It is important to note that the context does not explicitly mention the use of other data formats such as audio, video, or other image formats like JPEG or PNG. Therefore, based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline utilizes Sentinel-2 satellite images and CSV files.
