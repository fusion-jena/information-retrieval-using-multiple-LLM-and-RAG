Answer:

 I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context mainly focuses on the application of deep learning-enhanced fusion methods for improved NDVI reconstruction and long-term vegetation cover study in the Danjiang River basin. It mentions the use of MCD43A4 V6.1 data, pre-processing steps, and comparison of different methods but does not provide information about the code repository.
