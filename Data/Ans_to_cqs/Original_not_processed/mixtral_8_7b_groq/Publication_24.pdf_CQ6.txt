Answer:::

In the context provided, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), include normalization strategies such as whitening and subtraction of mean values along each frequency bin. 

Whitening is a normalization technique used to make the features of the input data have zero mean and unit variance (Lee, Pham, Largman, & Ng, 2009). This technique is applied independently for CityBioNet and CityAnthroNet to preprocess spectrograms before they are used in the ML pipeline. 

Subtraction of mean values along each frequency bin is another normalization strategy used in the preprocessing of spectrograms (Aide et al., 2013). This technique involves subtracting the mean value of each frequency bin from the corresponding values in the spectrogram.

The preprocessed spectrograms are then provided as input to the CNN, which is able to accept inputs with multiple channels of data. In this case, four spectrograms, each preprocessed using a different normalization strategy, are used as input to the CNN.

It is worth noting that the specific preprocessing steps used may vary depending on the nature of the input data and the requirements of the deep learning model being used. However, normalization strategies such as whitening and subtraction of mean values along each frequency bin are commonly used preprocessing steps in the training of deep learning models.
