Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The text focuses on the development of an equitable nutrient reduction decision support tool, which includes the use of various best management practices (BMPs) for stormwater runoff. However, it does not mention any details about the development or generalizability of a deep learning model.

There are some relevant concepts mentioned in the text that could be used in the development of a generalizable deep learning model, such as the use of a diverse dataset and cross-validation. For example, the authors mention the use of various sociodemographic metrics to create environmental justice indices, which could be considered a diverse dataset. Additionally, the authors use weekly street sweeping, wet pond, and wetland detention as BMPs, which could be used as features in a model. However, these concepts are not explicitly connected to the development of a deep learning model.

In summary, based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.
