Answer:::

The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved containerization using Docker and hosting on Google Cloud Run. The model was built using the YOLOv5 family, including YOLOv5n, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l, and YOLOv5x, to detect alates on sorghum leaves. The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing sets with a ratio of 80:10:10, respectively. The training dataset consisted of 1543 images for the 640 × 640 pixels input resolution and 1637 images for the 1280 × 1280 pixels input resolution.

Once the model was trained and validated, it was serialized, which involves converting the model into a format that can be stored and loaded again. This allows the model to be deployed and run on different platforms. In this case, the serialized model was containerized using Docker, an open-platform used for building, distributing, and running containerized applications. Containerization involves packaging the application and its dependencies into a container, which ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments.

After containerization, the model was hosted on Google Cloud Run, a service used to build and deploy containerized applications. Google Cloud Run is a managed compute platform that enables the deployment of stateless containers. It automatically scales the application in response to traffic, which ensures that the application remains responsive even under heavy load.

In summary, the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model involved serializing the model, containerizing it using Docker, and hosting it on Google Cloud Run. This process ensures that the model can be deployed and run consistently across different environments, and it can automatically scale in response to traffic.
