Answer:
The provided context does not explicitly name the datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, but it does mention that the pipeline is evaluated on simulated data sets. These simulated data sets are used to train the CNN model and test its ability to train in reasonable times. The training process takes around 20 minutes for a 200-taxon data set and 260 minutes for a 10,000-taxon data set. The placement of 1000 queries takes 4 seconds for the 200-taxon data set and 30 seconds for the 10,000-taxon data set.

The context also mentions that the performance of the pipeline is compared to EPA-ng and APPLES+JC. However, these are not datasets but rather alternative methods for phylogenetic placement.

Therefore, while the context provides some information about the data used in the pipeline, it does not specify any well-known datasets such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
