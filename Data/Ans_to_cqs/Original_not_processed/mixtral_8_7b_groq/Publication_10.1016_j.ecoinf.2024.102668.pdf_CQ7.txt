Answer:::

The criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets, are not specified in the provided context. However, the context does offer some insights into best practices for handling data in audio signal processing and ecological monitoring that could inform this decision.

In the context of audio signal processing for ecological monitoring, it is crucial to consider the differences between recording devices and their impact on the resulting acoustic data (Shaw et al., n.d.). This includes factors such as the sampling frequency (FS) and gain settings, which can affect the quality and consistency of the data. For instance, the context mentions the use of SongMeter and AudioMoth devices with different FS and gain settings. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that the data split is representative of these variations to develop a robust deep learning model.

One common approach to splitting data in machine learning is to use 70-80% of the data for training, 10-15% for validation, and the remaining 10-15% for testing (Kohavi, 1995). This approach allows for the model to learn from the majority of the data, while also providing a separate set for tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the model's performance.

In the context of ecological monitoring, it may be beneficial to split the data based on factors such as location, time, or species to ensure that the model is exposed to a diverse range of acoustic data. For example, if the data were collected from multiple locations, it would be important to ensure that each location is represented in each data split. Similarly, if the data were collected over a long period, it would be important to ensure that the data split includes recordings from different times of the year.

Moreover, the context highlights the importance of reducing device bias to enhance the applicability of acoustic indices for broader comparative analyses (Ross et al., 2021). Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that the data split includes a representative sample of the different recording devices used.

In summary, while the context does not provide specific criteria for splitting the data for deep learning model training, it highlights the importance of considering the impact of recording devices and ensuring that the data split is representative of the variations in the data. Common approaches to data splitting, such as using 70-80% of the data for training, 10-15% for validation, and the remaining 10-15% for testing, could be applied in this context. Additionally, it may be beneficial to split the data based on factors such as location, time, or species to ensure that the model is exposed to a diverse range of acoustic data.
