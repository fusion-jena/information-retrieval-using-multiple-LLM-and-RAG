Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. The pipeline's code is available on GitHub, but there is no mention of a data repository link for the model's weights, training data, or other related resources.

The training dataset used for this pipeline is the PlantNet dataset, which consists of around 250K images belonging to more than 6K plant species of Western Europe. These images are available under a Creative-Common Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 license. However, the provided context does not specify where the pre-trained ImageNet weights used for initializing the model's weights are hosted.

In summary, while the code for the deep learning pipeline is available on GitHub, there is no explicit information provided about a data repository link for the model's weights, training data, or other related resources.
