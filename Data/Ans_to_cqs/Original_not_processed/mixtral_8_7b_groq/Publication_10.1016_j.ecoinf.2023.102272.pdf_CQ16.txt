Answer:::
The criteria used to determine when training is complete for the model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the optimal number of epochs to train the selected candidate model is determined using validation data (Bv). This suggests that some form of validation-based early stopping criteria might have been used, such as stopping the training when the validation loss plateaus or starts to degrade. However, the specifics of this criteria are not provided in the context. It is also possible that the training was stopped after a fixed number of epochs (30) for the final model, as mentioned in the model selection procedure. Nonetheless, the exact criteria for determining the completion of training remain unclear based on the given context.
