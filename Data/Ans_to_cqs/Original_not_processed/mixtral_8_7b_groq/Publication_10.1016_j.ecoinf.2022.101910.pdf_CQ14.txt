The provided context does not give information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. There is no mention of any methods such as grid search, random search, or any other optimization techniques used for tuning the hyperparameters of the model.

The context mainly discusses various studies and methods related to bird vocalization analysis, such as the identification of species based on their sounds, the use of automated recognition systems, and the comparison of audio recording systems for detecting and monitoring songbirds.

There is a reference to a study by Kahl et al. (2021) that evaluates the accuracy of BirdNET, a deep learning-based bird sound recognition system. However, the study does not mention any details about the optimization of the hyperparameters of the model.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to answer the query regarding the optimization of the hyperparameters of the model.
