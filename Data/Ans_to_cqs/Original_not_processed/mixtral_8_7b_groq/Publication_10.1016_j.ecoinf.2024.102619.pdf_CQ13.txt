Answer:::

In the context provided, the deep learning model referred to is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The hyperparameters used in this CNN model include a batch size of 32 images and a cross-entropy loss function. The learning rate is not explicitly mentioned, but it is stated that the Adam learning rate optimizer was used, which automatically adjusts the initial learning rate of 1e-03 during training. This optimizer was chosen for its computational efficiency and straightforward use. Additionally, early stopping was implemented to identify a suitable number of epochs for each dataset, with the model stopping training if the validation error did not reduce for 10 epochs. The specific number of epochs for each dataset varies, with 14, 14, and 23 epochs for Datasets 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

It is important to note that the context does not provide information on other hyperparameters that are typically involved in training a CNN, such as the number of filters, kernel size, or pooling strategy. The context suggests that these hyperparameters were set to default values or determined through preliminary work not described in the text.

In summary, the hyperparameters specified for the CNN model include a batch size of 32 images, a cross-entropy loss function, and the Adam learning rate optimizer. The number of epochs was determined through early stopping, with 14, 14, and 23 epochs for Datasets 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Other hyperparameters are not explicitly mentioned in the context provided.
