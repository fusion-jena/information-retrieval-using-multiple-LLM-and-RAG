Answer:

The context provided does not give specific information about the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the model was built using TensorFlow and Keras, which are libraries that support the use of GPUs and TPUs for training deep learning models. Therefore, it is likely that either GPUs or TPUs were used for training the model, but the specific hardware resources are not mentioned.
