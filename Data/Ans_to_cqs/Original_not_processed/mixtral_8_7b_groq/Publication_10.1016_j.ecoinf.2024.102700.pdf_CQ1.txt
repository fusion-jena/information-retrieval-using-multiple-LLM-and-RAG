Answer:::

In the deep learning pipeline for ecological modeling, various methods are utilized for collecting raw data, including surveys, sensors, and public datasets. However, it's important to note that the data collected from these methods can be unstandardized, particularly when obtained from large databases or citizen science social media records.

Surveys are a common method for collecting ecological data. According to a study published in Ecological Informatics, dedicated surveys are used to collect data, although to a lesser extent compared to other data sources. These surveys can be conducted in-situ, along predetermined routes, and often follow an equal coverage probability design, where each point in the study area has an equal probability of being sampled. Additionally, opportunistic in-situ surveys are also used, which are typically conducted as part of other research activities.

Two types of surveys are commonly used in ecological studies: visual and acoustic surveys. In visual surveys, data can be collected using transect methods or other methods presented in Figure 6B. On the other hand, acoustic surveys can use various devices, such as hydrophones or sonar, as shown in Figure 6D.

Sensors are another method for collecting ecological data. For instance, temperature measurements are primarily related to surface temperatures, with only a few articles featuring deep-sea temperature readings. However, bathymetry is also a commonly used environmental gradient variable (EGV), featuring in 88% of the reviewed articles.

Public datasets are a third method for collecting ecological data. The literature search conducted in January 2023 considered all studies currently available in the two databases until 31 December 2022. The search strategy used specific search terms, Boolean operators, and wildcards to account for word variants and plural forms. However, the search did not include grey literature, such as technical reports or dissertations, to limit the search to the most relevant and advanced scientific applications on the topic.

In summary, surveys, sensors, and public datasets are the primary methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for ecological modeling. However, it's important to note that the data collected from these methods can be unstandardized, particularly when obtained from large databases or citizen science social media records.
