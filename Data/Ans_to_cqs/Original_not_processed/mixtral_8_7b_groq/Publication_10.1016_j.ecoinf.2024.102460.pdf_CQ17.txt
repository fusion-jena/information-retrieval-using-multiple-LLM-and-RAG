The provided context does not include specific information about the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does discuss the use of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a type of deep learning model, for predicting time series data.

Regularization methods, such as dropout and L2 regularization, are commonly used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training, which helps to prevent over-reliance on specific neurons and improves the model's ability to generalize. L2 regularization, on the other hand, adds a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the model's weights. This encourages the model to have smaller weights, which can help to reduce overfitting.

While the provided context does not specifically mention these regularization methods, it is likely that they would be used in a deep learning pipeline that includes an LSTM model. It is best to refer to the specific deep learning pipeline being used for more information on the regularization methods employed.
