Answer:::

The specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning models mentioned in the provided context are not specified. However, I can provide some general information about common hyperparameters used in deep learning models for image classification and object detection.

In the context, several papers use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification and object detection tasks. CNNs are a type of deep learning model that have been very successful in computer vision tasks.

Some common hyperparameters used in CNNs for image classification and object detection include:

1. Learning rate: This is a hyperparameter that controls how much the weights in the model are adjusted during training. A learning rate that is too high may cause the model to converge too quickly to a suboptimal solution, while a learning rate that is too low may cause the training process to be very slow.
2. Optimizer: This is a hyperparameter that determines how the weights in the model are updated during training. Common optimizers include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop.
3. Number of epochs: This is a hyperparameter that determines the number of times the training data is passed through the model during training.
4. Batch size: This is a hyperparameter that determines the number of samples that are processed before the weights in the model are updated.
5. Number of layers and number of neurons per layer: These are hyperparameters that determine the architecture of the model.
6. Regularization techniques: These are hyperparameters that help prevent overfitting, such as L1 and L2 regularization, dropout, and data augmentation.

It is important to note that the choice of hyperparameters can have a significant impact on the performance of the model. Therefore, it is common to use techniques such as grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization to find the best set of hyperparameters for a given task.
