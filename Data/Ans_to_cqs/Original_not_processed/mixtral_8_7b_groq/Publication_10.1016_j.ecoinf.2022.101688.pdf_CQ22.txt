Answer: The metric used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning models in the given context is the F1 score. The F1 score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that encapsulates both. Precision is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions, while recall is the ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positives in the data. The F1 score is a useful metric when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where one class may have significantly more samples than another. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible score, indicating perfect precision and recall. In the context provided, the average F1 score is reported for different network architectures and dataset configurations, with the best three performing network architectures highlighted in bold for each dataset configuration.
