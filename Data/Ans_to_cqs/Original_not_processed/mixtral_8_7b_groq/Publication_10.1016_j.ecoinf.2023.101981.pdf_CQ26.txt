The provided context discusses the use of machine learning algorithms for the detection of ungulate vocalizations, specifically focusing on Sika Deer and Red Deer, but it does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, I can provide some general information about common techniques used to address data bias in machine learning and deep learning.

One common technique to address data bias is through diverse data collection. This involves making a conscious effort to collect data from a wide range of sources and ensuring that the data is representative of the population the model will be applied to. This can help to reduce bias in the training data and improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Another technique is stratified sampling, which is a method of sampling that ensures each stratum (or subgroup) of the population is proportionally represented in the sample. This can be useful when the population is not evenly distributed, and can help to ensure that the training data is representative of the overall population.

Oversampling and undersampling are two techniques used to address class imbalance in the training data. Class imbalance occurs when one class has significantly more examples than another class. Oversampling involves increasing the number of examples in the underrepresented class, while undersampling involves decreasing the number of examples in the overrepresented class. These techniques can help to improve the model's ability to learn from the underrepresented class and reduce bias.

In summary, while the provided context does not specifically mention the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, some common techniques include diverse data collection, stratified sampling, oversampling, and undersampling. These techniques can help to ensure that the training data is representative of the overall population and improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data.
