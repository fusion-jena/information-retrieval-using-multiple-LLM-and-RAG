Answer:::

The provided text does not give information on how the hyperparameters of the model were optimized. Hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization are commonly used in machine learning to find the best set of hyperparameters for a model. However, the specific method used in this research is not mentioned. It is possible that the authors used a method other than grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization, or they may have chosen not to include those details in the text. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query without additional information.
