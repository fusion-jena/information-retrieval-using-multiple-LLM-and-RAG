Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used for predicting water quality parameters with hyperspectral data. The articles mentioned in the context provide valuable insights into the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for estimating water quality parameters using hyperspectral data. However, they do not provide information about the code repositories.

The article by Saberioon et al. (2023) highlights the importance of essential parameters such as the number and spatial distribution of samples and the influence of different atmospheric correction algorithms for creating a representative dataset and developing an ML-based model with acceptable generalization. Similarly, the article by Maier et al. (2021) discusses the application of deep learning algorithms for estimating chlorophyll-a concentration in inland water bodies using WASI simulation data. However, neither of these articles provides information about the code repository for their deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, if you are looking for the code repository of the deep learning pipeline used for predicting water quality parameters with hyperspectral data, I would recommend checking the authors' repositories or contacting them directly for more information.
