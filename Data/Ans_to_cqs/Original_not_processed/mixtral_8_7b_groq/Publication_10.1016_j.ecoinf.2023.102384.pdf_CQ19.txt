Answer:::

The specific deep learning frameworks used to build the models mentioned in the context are not explicitly stated. However, we can make some educated guesses based on the common practice and the citation of a paper that uses TensorFlow.

The paper "Multi-scale context aggregation by dilated convolutions" by Yu and Koltun, 2016, which is cited in the context, uses TensorFlow as its deep learning framework. This paper introduces the concept of dilated convolutions, which has been widely adopted in various computer vision tasks, including object detection and counting. Therefore, it is possible that one or more of the models in the context were built using TensorFlow, considering the influence of this paper.

On the other hand, PyTorch is another popular deep learning framework, especially in the research community. Given the absence of specific information about the framework, it is also possible that some of the models were built using PyTorch.

In summary, based on the given context, we cannot definitively say which deep learning frameworks were used to build the models. However, considering the popularity and relevance of TensorFlow and PyTorch, it is reasonable to assume that one or both of these frameworks were used.
