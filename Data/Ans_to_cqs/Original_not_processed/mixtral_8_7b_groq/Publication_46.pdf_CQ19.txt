The context does not provide specific information about the deep learning framework used to build the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. However, it is mentioned that a deep learning-based CNN architecture was proposed, designed, and tested. Common deep learning frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. TensorFlow and Keras are both developed by Google, while PyTorch is developed by Facebook. These frameworks provide tools and functions for designing, training, and implementing deep learning models. Without further information, it is not possible to determine which specific framework was used to build the CNN model in this case.
