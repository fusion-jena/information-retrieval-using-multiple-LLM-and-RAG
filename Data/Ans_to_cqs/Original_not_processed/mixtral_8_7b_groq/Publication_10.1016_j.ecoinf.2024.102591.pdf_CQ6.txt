The provided context discusses the use of machine learning models in the FIREMAP system for analyzing post-fire Sentinel-2 (S2) scenes, but it does not mention any preprocessing steps specifically for deep learning models. However, it does mention some preprocessing steps for the data used in the machine learning models.

First, the S2 post-fire Level-2 scenes are atmospherically corrected and harmonized. This is an important preprocessing step for remote sensing data as it corrects for atmospheric effects that can influence the reflectance values of the data.

Next, a large predefined training dataset is used for the machine learning models. This dataset is likely cleaned and preprocessed in some way before being used for training. The specifics of this cleaning and preprocessing are not mentioned in the context.

For the PROSAIL-D RTM inversion, the RF regression algorithm is used to retrieve the FCOVER (fraction of vegetation cover) from the post-fire S2 scenes. Before training the RF regression model, the training samples are incorporated as an asset in Google Earth Engine (GEE). This suggests that some preprocessing may be done within GEE before training the model.

The default values for RF hyperparameters are preserved, except for the number of trees which is set to 500. This is a common preprocessing step for RF models to improve computational efficiency.

In summary, while the context does not specifically mention preprocessing steps for deep learning models, it does mention some preprocessing steps for the data used in the machine learning models, such as atmospheric correction, harmonization, and possible cleaning and preprocessing of the training dataset. Additionally, it mentions a common preprocessing step for RF models, adjusting the number of trees.
