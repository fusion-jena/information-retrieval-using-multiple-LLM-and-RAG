Answer:::

The deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CA-Hybrid network, which is a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT). The CNN component of the model is based on ResNet, which has a residual structure that connects different network layers via shortcuts. This helps in preserving the input features and addressing the degradation problem of deep networks, thereby improving the classification effect of the network. The integration of Class Activation Mapping (CAM) into the residual structure of ResNet in the CNN component enables the network to focus more on critical features, which boosts the generalization ability of the model. The ViT component of the model effectively extracts richer semantic features. This CA-Hybrid network is constructed as the classification network to precisely categorize Cervidae localized by YOLOv7.

In summary, the deep learning model used in the pipeline is a CA-Hybrid network, which is a combination of CNN (ResNet) and ViT.
