Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about specific post-processing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix that are involved after the model training. However, it does mention that the model development process includes replacing and retraining some of the classification layers for a specific problem. This implies that metrics calculation is likely a part of the post-processing, as it's necessary to evaluate the performance of the retrained model.

In the context of bioacoustics research and the use of CNNs, the post-processing steps might also include:

1. Data exploration and visualization: This step involves analyzing the output of the model, such as the detected vocalization events, and visualizing the results to ensure that the model is working as expected.

2. Filtering and cleaning: Depending on the quality of the input data, there might be a need for filtering out false positives or negatives, or cleaning up the detected vocalization events.

3. Feature engineering: In some cases, it might be necessary to extract additional features from the detected vocalization events, such as pitch, duration, or frequency, to improve the model's performance.

4. Hyperparameter tuning: While this step is mentioned as part of the model development process, it could also be considered a post-processing step, as it involves exploring various neural network hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.

5. Evaluation and comparison: Finally, the post-processing might include evaluating and comparing the performance of different models or classification layers, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1 score.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention post-processing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix, it is likely that these steps are included in the overall process of developing and using CNNs for bioacoustics research. Additional post-processing steps might include data exploration and visualization, filtering and cleaning, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation and comparison.
