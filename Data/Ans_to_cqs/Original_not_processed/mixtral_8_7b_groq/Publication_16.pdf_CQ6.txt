Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include the use of the Librosa library for data pre-processing. Specifically, the audio files are transmitted over 4G using SMTP and then segmented into 15-second windows. Each sample window is then passed to a feature extractor function where Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are used to return the extracted features for the classifier.

However, the context does not explicitly mention other common preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Normalization is a process that scales numeric data to a specific range, often between 0 and 1, to prevent any one feature from dominating the learning algorithm. Scaling involves transforming the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Cleaning refers to the removal of outliers, missing values, or other forms of noise that can negatively impact model performance.

Therefore, while the context provides some insight into the data pre-processing steps taken, it does not provide a complete picture of the preprocessing methods used. It is possible that additional preprocessing steps were taken but not mentioned in the provided text. Nonetheless, the use of MFCC for feature extraction is a common preprocessing step in audio-based deep learning models.
