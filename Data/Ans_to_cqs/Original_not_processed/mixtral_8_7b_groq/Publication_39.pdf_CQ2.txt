Answer:::

The data format used in the deep learning pipeline described in the given context is video.

In the study conducted by Schindler and Steinhage, they focused on the identification of animals and the recognition of their actions in wildlife videos. To achieve this, they utilized different data augmentation techniques during the training process specifically designed for image and video data. They used the python library imgaug to perform data augmentation on their images and videos.

For Mask R-CNN and FGFA, the same augmentation technique with identical parameters was applied to each frame of the video. The augmentation techniques used include horizontal flip, adding or subtracting intensity, Gaussian blur, additive Gaussian noise, and Fog. These techniques were applied simultaneously, with the Fog augmentation being performed with a probability of 10%, and the other combined augmentation techniques having a probability of 90%.

Moreover, the action recognition networks used in the study, such as 3D ResNets, ResNets with Mixed Convolutions, and R(2 + 1)D ResNets, take video clips as input, which are in the form of 3 × T × H × W, where T denotes the number of frames in the clip, H and W are the height and width of the image, and the 3 represents the three color channels RGB.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline described in the given context primarily works with video data.
