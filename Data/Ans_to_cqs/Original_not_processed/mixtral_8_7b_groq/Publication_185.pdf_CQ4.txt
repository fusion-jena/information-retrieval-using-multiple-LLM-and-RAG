Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are no specific data augmentation techniques mentioned that were applied in the deep learning pipeline. The experiments were performed on a small-size dataset without data augmentation. However, the text does mention that data resampling was used to compare balanced data performance with imbalanced data. Data resampling is a technique used to solve the problem of imbalanced data, but it is not a data augmentation technique. Common data augmentation techniques used in deep learning pipelines include flipping, rotating, and scaling. These techniques are used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by creating modified versions of the images in the dataset. By applying these transformations, the model can learn to be more invariant to these changes, which can improve its performance on the original images. Since the text does not mention the use of these techniques, it is assumed that they were not used in this particular deep learning pipeline.
