The provided context does not include information on the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context of forest inventory or biomass estimation. However, it is common in machine learning and data analysis to consider training as complete when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly. This indicates that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the data and further training is unlikely to improve its performance.

In the context of forest biomass estimation, Bortolot and Wynne (2005) used small footprint LiDAR data and an individual tree-based approach that incorporates training data. The specific criteria for determining when training is complete are not provided in the paper. However, they did use a separate validation dataset to assess the performance of their model.

Chen (2007) studied the forest biomass and carbon storage in Xiaolong Mountain, including needleleaf forest, broadleaf forest, and mixed forest. The study used data from multiple forest inventory periods, but the criteria for determining when training is complete are not specified.

Bonan (2008) discussed the role of forests in climate change, including the feedbacks and climate benefits of forests. While the study touches on the importance of accurate forest biomass estimation, it does not provide information on the criteria for determining when training is complete.

Bradford et al. (2008) studied tree age, disturbance history, and carbon stocks and fluxes in subalpine Rocky Mountain forests. The study used tree-core data and a mixed-effects model, but the criteria for determining when training is complete are not provided.

In summary, while the criteria for determining when training is complete in the context of forest biomass estimation are not specified in the provided context, it is common to consider training as complete when the validation loss plateaus or stops decreasing significantly. Further research would be needed to determine the specific criteria used in the studies mentioned.
