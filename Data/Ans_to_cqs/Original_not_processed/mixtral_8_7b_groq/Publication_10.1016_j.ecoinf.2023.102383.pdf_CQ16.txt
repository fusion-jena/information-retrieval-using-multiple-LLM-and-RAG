Answer:::

The criteria used to determine when training is complete in the context of object detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are not explicitly stated. However, based on the provided information, we can infer that the training process might be determined by a validation loss plateau or through trial and error.

Hard negative mining, a technique mentioned in the context, focuses on challenging negative examples during the training process. By selectively mining hard negative examples, the model can learn to better distinguish between objects and background regions, leading to improved overall performance. This technique is typically used to improve the training process, but it does not provide a direct criterion for determining when training is complete.

The Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold is another factor mentioned in the context. IoU is a measure of the overlap between the predicted bounding box and the ground truth bounding box. In this case, a threshold of 0.5 is used to determine whether a prediction is a true positive. However, this threshold is used for evaluation purposes and not for determining when the training process is complete.

The performance of the models is evaluated using IoU thresholds ranging from 0.5 to 0.95 with a step size of 0.05. The mean of the ten precision values is then computed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the models' performance. However, this evaluation metric is not used to determine when the training process is complete.

The context also mentions that the training process is determined based on trials and errors. This suggests that the training process might be manually determined by monitoring the performance of the model and stopping the training process when the desired performance is achieved.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly state the criteria used to determine when training is complete, we can infer that it might be determined by a validation loss plateau or through trial and error. Hard negative mining and IoU thresholds are used to improve the training process, but they do not provide a direct criterion for determining when training is complete.
