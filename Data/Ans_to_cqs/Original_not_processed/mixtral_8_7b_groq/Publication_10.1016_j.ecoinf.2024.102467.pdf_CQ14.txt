Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information given about how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through methods like grid search or random search. However, the text does mention that the authors designed a backbone to improve the training speed of the model while ensuring detection accuracy and speed. This suggests that they likely employed some optimization techniques to find the best set of hyperparameters for their specific task.

Moreover, the context highlights the comparison of the algorithm used in the study with other methods, including YOLOv8, and mentions that the number of parameters is significantly reduced while maintaining a comparable level of detection accuracy. This indicates that the authors might have used techniques like pruning, quantization, or other model compression methods to reduce the complexity of the model and optimize its performance.

In summary, while the context does not explicitly state the hyperparameter optimization method, it can be inferred that the authors used some optimization techniques, possibly including model compression methods, to reduce model complexity and improve training speed while maintaining detection accuracy. However, the specific optimization method remains undisclosed in the provided context.
