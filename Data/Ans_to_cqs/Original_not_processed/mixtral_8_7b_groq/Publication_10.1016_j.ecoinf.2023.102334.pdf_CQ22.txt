Answer: The performance of the deep learning model for juvenile deer face recognition was evaluated using several metrics derived from the confusion matrix. These metrics include accuracy, precision, and others. Accuracy is the ratio of the model's correct predictions to the total number of samples. Precision, on the other hand, is the ratio of true positive predictions (correctly predicted samples of a certain category) to the total predicted samples of that category.

In the given context, the accuracy of each model was reported in Table 4, with the highest accuracy achieved by the "Our model" at 98.58%. However, the specific precision, recall, and other metrics for each category were not provided in the text. Instead, the confusion matrix was used to observe the performance of the model on each category. The normalized confusion matrix, as shown in the article, allowed for quick observation of the model's performance on each category. The main diagonal position in the matrix represented the ratio of the model's correct predictions for each category, while the sum of the data excluding the main diagonal position in each row represented the missed detection rate of the model for that category. Similarly, the missed detection rate for each input category was represented in each column.

Moreover, the models were evaluated based on their parameter size and computational complexity, which are essential factors for real-world applications. The "Our model" had a parameter size of 2.60 MB and a computational complexity of 2.60 GigaFlops, which is relatively smaller and less computationally intensive compared to other models like Swin Transformer (5.17 GB and 5.17 GigaFlops).

In summary, the deep learning model for juvenile deer face recognition was evaluated using accuracy, precision, and other metrics derived from the confusion matrix. The confusion matrix provided insights into the model's performance on each category, while the parameter size and computational complexity were used to evaluate the model's efficiency.
