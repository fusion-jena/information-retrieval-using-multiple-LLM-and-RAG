After training a convolutional neural network model for pollen species identification using multispectral imaging flow cytometry, several postprocessing steps can be involved. These steps typically include:

1. **Saliency Maps**: Saliency maps can be used to visualize the regions of the input image that the model is paying attention to when making its predictions. This can be useful for understanding how the model is making its decisions and for identifying any potential biases or weaknesses in the model.
2. **Metrics Calculation**: Various metrics can be calculated to evaluate the performance of the model. These metrics can include accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions, while precision measures the proportion of true positives among all positive predictions. Recall measures the proportion of true positives among all actual positives, and F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. AUC-ROC measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes.
3. **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix can be used to visualize the performance of the model. A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the predictions made by the model, showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. From the confusion matrix, we can calculate various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
4. **Class Activation Mapping (CAM)**: CAM is a technique used to visualize the discriminative regions used by a CNN to make a decision. It can help us understand which regions of the input image are most important for the model's prediction.
5. **Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)**: Grad-CAM is an extension of CAM that uses the gradients of the target class flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map that highlights the important regions in the image for predicting the target class.
6. **Model Testing**: The trained model can be tested on a new dataset to evaluate its performance on unseen data. This can help ensure that the model is generalizing well to new data and is not overfitting to the training data.

In the context of the provided pieces of information, the researchers could use any or all of these postprocessing steps to evaluate the performance of their pollen species identification model. For example, they could use saliency maps to understand how the model is making its predictions, calculate metrics such as accuracy and F1 score to evaluate the model's performance, and use a confusion matrix to visualize the model's predictions. Additionally, they could use CAM or Grad-CAM to visualize the discriminative regions used by the model to make its predictions.
