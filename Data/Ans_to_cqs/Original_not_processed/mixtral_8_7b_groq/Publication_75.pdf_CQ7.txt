Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training into subsets such as training, validation, and testing. However, it can be inferred that the authors conducted retrieval experiments using the entire dataset, where every image is matched with every remaining image in the database. This suggests that they might have used the entire dataset for training and testing their model without a separate validation set.

Moreover, the authors compared their proposed deep learning model, SeedNet, with traditional machine learning methods. They mentioned that SeedNet outperformed other considered networks and traditional methods in both classification and retrieval tasks. However, they did not provide any details about the data splitting strategy used for training and testing the traditional machine learning methods.

In general, when developing deep learning models, it is essential to split the data into separate subsets for training, validation, and testing. This practice helps to evaluate the model's performance, prevent overfitting, and ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data. Commonly, data splitting strategies include random sampling, stratified sampling, or time-series-based splitting. However, the provided context does not contain information on the specific criteria used for data splitting in this study.
