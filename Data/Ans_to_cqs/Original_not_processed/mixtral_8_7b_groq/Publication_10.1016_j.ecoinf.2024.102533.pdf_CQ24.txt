The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does describe a methodology for determining the number of clusters in fish freshness data, which involves some level of randomness.

In the process of generating a fish freshness report dataset, the authors use a clustering approach to experiment with the number and range of freshness classes. Specifically, they automatically identify the number of classes and their duration for each fish, evaluating them using the elbow method. This process involves some level of randomness, as the initial placement of data points in clusters can affect the final clustering result.

To minimize the impact of this randomness, the authors use a systematic approach for determining the number of clusters. They utilize 2 to 10 clusters and select the appropriate number of freshness clusters for each species based on the elbow method. This approach helps to ensure that the selection of clusters is not overly influenced by the initial random placement of data points.

While this example does not directly relate to deep learning pipelines, it does demonstrate a general strategy for handling randomness in data analysis: using a systematic approach to minimize the impact of initial randomness on the final result. In the context of deep learning, this could translate to setting a fixed random seed value to ensure consistent initialization of random processes, as well as using systematic methods for hyperparameter tuning and model selection.
