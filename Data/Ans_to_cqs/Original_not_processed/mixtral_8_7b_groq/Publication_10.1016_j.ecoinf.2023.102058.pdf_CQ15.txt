Answer:::

The provided context discusses the application of machine learning (ML) and deep learning algorithms for predicting water quality parameters using orbital hyperspectral data. However, it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.

Nevertheless, it is well-known that optimization techniques play a crucial role in training deep learning models. These techniques help minimize the difference between predicted and actual values, enabling the model to learn and generalize better.

Some commonly used optimization techniques in deep learning include Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop), and Adagrad.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model's parameters by computing the gradient of the loss function concerning each training example. Although SGD is computationally efficient, it may not converge optimally due to its simplicity.

Adam, on the other hand, is an extension of SGD that combines the advantages of two other optimization algorithms: Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad) and Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop). Adam adaptively adjusts the learning rate for each parameter, making it more suitable for complex models and large datasets.

The context also mentions that a grid search was used to find the best number of trees (ntrees) for a machine learning model. While grid search is a hyperparameter tuning technique, it is not an optimization technique for deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, it is reasonable to assume that optimization techniques such as SGD, Adam, or other similar methods were employed.
