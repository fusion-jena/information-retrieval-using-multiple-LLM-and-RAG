Answer:::
I'm sorry for any confusion, but the provided context does not include information about the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context focuses on the evaluation of different models for predicting the Muntjac deer range in Great Britain and Ireland, using metrics such as AUC, TPR, TSS, and Kappa. The models are divided into five categories: random background, filtered, targeted, filtered and targeted, and weighted. The context also mentions that the threshold used for evaluation is the 10th percentile training presence, and that two different test datasets were used. However, there is no information about the use of a deep learning model or its specific hyperparameters.
