Answer:::

The provided article does not discuss the deployment of a deep learning model. Instead, it focuses on the use of a machine learning technique called Random Forest (RF) for species distribution modeling (SDM). Specifically, the authors describe a bootstrapping approach for RF model training and validation.

In this approach, the entire camera trap dataset is subsampled by randomly selecting 20% of the presence and absence locations. This subsampled dataset is then used to train RF models, and the process is repeated 100 times, each time with a different randomly selected subset of the data. The final species distribution probability surfaces are obtained by averaging the 100 probability surfaces, independently for each felid species.

The RF models are produced using a two-stage bagging procedure. Bagging, or bootstrap aggregating, is a technique used to reduce the variance of a model by averaging the predictions of multiple models trained on different subsets of the data. In this case, the authors implement a two-stage bagging procedure by bootstrapping the training data of each RF model, resulting in a more precise model.

It's important to note that the article does not mention the use of deep learning models for SDM. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been used for image recognition tasks in ecology, such as identifying species from camera trap images. However, the article focuses on RF models and their validation through bootstrapping.

Therefore, the provided context does not contain information on the deployment of a deep learning model.
