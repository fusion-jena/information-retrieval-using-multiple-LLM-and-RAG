Answer:
The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of environmental variables and machine learning algorithms for maize yield prediction in the US Midwest. Therefore, it can be inferred that the data used in the study is related to environmental factors affecting maize yield.

Environmental data can be collected using various methods, including but not limited to:

1. Surveys: Surveys can be conducted to collect data on various environmental factors, such as soil type, slope, aspect, and land use history. Surveys can be carried out through interviews, questionnaires, or online forms.
2. Sensors: Sensors can be used to collect real-time data on environmental variables, such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and soil moisture. Sensors can be installed in the field to measure these variables continuously or at regular intervals.
3. Public datasets: Public datasets can be a valuable source of environmental data. For example, the US Geological Survey (USGS) provides access to various environmental datasets, including climate, water, and soil data.
4. Remote sensing: Remote sensing techniques, such as satellite imagery and aerial photography, can be used to collect data on environmental variables, such as land cover, vegetation, and topography. Remote sensing can provide spatial and temporal data on a large scale.

In summary, environmental data for deep learning pipelines can be collected using various methods, including surveys, sensors, public datasets, and remote sensing. However, the specific methods used in the study mentioned in the context are not provided.
