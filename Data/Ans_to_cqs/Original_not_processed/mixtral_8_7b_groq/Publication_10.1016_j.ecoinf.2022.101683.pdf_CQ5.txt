Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline uses three different datasets: a training set, test set #1, and test set #2. However, the context does not provide specific names for these datasets, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.

The training set consists of 75% of the data, randomly selected. Four evaluation metrics are calculated for this set: AUC, Omission, TPR, and Kappa. The best model for each metric is highlighted in bold.

Test set #1 includes the remaining 25% of the data, also selected randomly. The same four evaluation metrics are calculated for this set.

Test set #2 contains only Irish records. This set also has four evaluation metrics calculated.

It is important to note that, while the context provides detailed information about the models, evaluation metrics, and results, it does not offer specific details about the datasets used. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the datasets used are standard benchmark datasets commonly used in deep learning, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet.
