Answer:::
The code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study is available on GitHub. You can access the R and JAGS code, sample data, and results of the study at <https://github.com/GAMELab-UGA>. Additionally, the python source code used to design, train, and test the northern bobwhite detection model can be downloaded from <https://github.com/GAMELab-UGA>, along with a pre-trained model.

The study used a convolutional neural network (CNN) for acoustic detection of the northern bobwhite. The CNN model was trained using data collected on Di-Lane Plantation WMA, Burke County, Georgia during autumn 2016-2018. The model can be retrained or used as-is to detect the target species of interest.

The code repository also includes a point count and an automated recording unit (ARU) distance sampling (DS) model fit to the data collected during the study. The model estimates the density of northern bobwhite in 2016, 2017, and 2018, as well as the total detection probability within a point count location and the scale parameter of the detection function.

Overall, the code repository provides a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested in using deep learning techniques for acoustic detection of wildlife species.
