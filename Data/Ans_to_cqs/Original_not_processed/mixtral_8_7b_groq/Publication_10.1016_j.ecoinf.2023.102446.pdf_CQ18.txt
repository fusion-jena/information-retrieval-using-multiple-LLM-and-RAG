Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The text focuses on the data collection, processing, and the application of TIPNet-based process network approach to identify causal links between variables in a pine-dominated ecosystem. It mentions that the network computation considered lagged information up to 12 hours (Ï„ = 1 to 12) and a significance level of 1%. It also states that TPINet works effectively when there are at least 200 data points and can reveal interactions on hourly to daily time scales over several-day-time windows. However, it does not provide details about the model performance monitoring strategy during the training phase. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query without speculating or making assumptions.

Answer::: 
(Answer to query: "What is the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training?")

The provided context does not contain information on the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training.
