Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline. The text describes the methods used to train individual models for ensemble models in the context of habitat selection modeling. Six modeling approaches were used, including Generalized Linear Models (GLMs), Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Maximum Entropy software (MaxEnt). The models were built using the biomod2 package in R. However, there is no information about where the code repository for this deep learning pipeline is available, such as on GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
