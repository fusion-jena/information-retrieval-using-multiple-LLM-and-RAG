The provided pieces of context do not directly answer the query regarding the methods used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines. However, they do offer some insight into the types of data used in specific studies.

In Hanintyo et al. (2021), the authors use Landsat 8 data for their study on chlorophyll-a and total suspended matter retrieval. Landsat 8 is a satellite launched by NASA and the US Geological Survey, which provides multispectral images of the Earth's surface (NASA, n.d.). In He et al. (2013), the authors use geostationary satellite ocean color data for mapping the diurnal dynamics of suspended particulate matter in coastal waters. Geostationary satellites remain above the same region of the Earth, providing continuous data (NOAA, n.d.).

In Noori et al. (2024), the authors use time-series satellite imagery for lake total suspended matter retrieval by wind speed. While the specific source of the satellite imagery is not mentioned, it can be inferred that they used satellite data similar to Hanintyo et al. (2021) and He et al. (2013).

In Bowers (2003), the author uses in-situ measurements of fine suspended sediments in the Irish Sea. This study uses sensors to collect raw data. In Bright et al. (2018), the authors use nephelometric turbidity measurements, which is a method of measuring the amount of light scattered by suspended particles in water (Standard Methods, 2017).

From these studies, it can be observed that various methods are used for collecting raw data in deep learning pipelines, including satellite imagery, in-situ sensors, and public datasets. The choice of data collection method depends on the specific research question and the availability of data.
