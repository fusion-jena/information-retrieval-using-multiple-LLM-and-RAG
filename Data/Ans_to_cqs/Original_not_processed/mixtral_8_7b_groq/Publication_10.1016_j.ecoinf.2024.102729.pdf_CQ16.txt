Answer:::
The provided context does not give specific information about the criteria used to determine when training is complete in the development of Random Forest (RF) models. However, it does mention that the dataset was divided into training and testing subsets, and the performance of the RF models was evaluated against the testing datasets. This suggests that the models' performance on the unseen testing data was considered during the training process.

In general, in machine learning, including RF models, training is often considered complete when the performance on a validation set stops improving or shows a plateau. This is often achieved by monitoring the performance on the validation set after each epoch or iteration during the training process. Once the performance stops improving or shows a consistent pattern, the training can be considered complete to prevent overfitting.

However, the specific criteria used in this study are not mentioned in the provided context. Therefore, without further information, a precise answer cannot be given.
