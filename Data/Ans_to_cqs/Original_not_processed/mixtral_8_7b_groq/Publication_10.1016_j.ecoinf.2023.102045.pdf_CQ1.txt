The provided context does not contain information about the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the importance of accurate data representation in maps and the impact of color gradients on scientific communication, particularly for individuals with color blindness. It refers to the use of data in scientific studies and ecological informatics but does not mention specific data collection methods for deep learning pipelines.

Deep learning pipelines typically involve several stages, starting with data collection, followed by data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation. Data collection methods can vary widely depending on the specific application and data type. Some common methods include:

1. Surveys: These can be conducted online, on paper, or in person to collect data from a sample of individuals or organizations. Surveys can be useful for collecting subjective data, such as opinions or attitudes, or for gathering demographic information.
2. Sensors: Sensors can be used to collect data automatically, such as temperature readings, humidity levels, or location data. Sensors can be attached to moving objects, such as vehicles or animals, or placed in fixed locations, such as weather stations or monitoring wells.
3. Public datasets: Many organizations make data publicly available for research or other purposes. Public datasets can be a valuable resource for deep learning applications, particularly in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

It's important to note that the choice of data collection method will depend on the specific application and the type of data needed. In some cases, a combination of methods may be used to collect the necessary data.
