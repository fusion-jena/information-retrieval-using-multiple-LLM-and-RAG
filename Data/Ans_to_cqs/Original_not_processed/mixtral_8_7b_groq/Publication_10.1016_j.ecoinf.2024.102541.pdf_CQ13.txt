Answer:::
The provided context discusses a deep learning model for real-time species recognition, but it does not explicitly list all the hyperparameters used in the model. However, it does mention some parameters and computational complexities related to the model architecture.

The model's computational cost is quantified in FLOPs (Floating Point Operations Per Second), which depends on the convolutional kernel size (k2), the number of input and output channels (Cin and Cout), and the feature map's height (hout) and width (wout). The model's speed is measured in FPS (Frames Per Second), which includes pre-processing, inference, and non-maximum suppression speeds.

In addition, the paper mentions a comparison with state-of-the-art deep learning models, where they achieved a 17.65% increase in FPS, a 28.55% reduction in model parameters, and a 50.92% reduction in FLOPs. This suggests that they might have used optimization techniques like learning rate scheduling, weight decay, or dropout to reduce overfitting and improve the model's performance.

Furthermore, the model is based on the MobileNetV2 architecture, which includes a stem layer (a 3 × 3 convolutional layer followed by batch normalization and ReLU activation) and a head layer (a global average pooling operation followed by a 1 × 1 convolutional layer and softmax activation function). The MobileNetV2 architecture uses depthwise separable convolutions and inverted residual blocks (MBBlocks) to reduce computational cost and improve model efficiency.

Therefore, while the context does not provide an exhaustive list of hyperparameters, it can be inferred that the model might have used hyperparameters like learning rate, optimizer (e.g., SGD, Adam), learning rate scheduling, weight decay, dropout, and other regularization techniques.
