The provided context discusses techniques to address bias in the context of forest inventory analysis using NN1 and NN2 estimators, but it does not directly refer to data preprocessing in deep learning pipelines. However, I will attempt to provide an answer that draws parallels between the two.

In forest inventory analysis, bias reduction is achieved by using edge-correction methods such as NN1 and NN2 estimators. These methods are designed to correct for the bias introduced by the exclusion of some sample trees and their neighbors from the relascope sample. Although these estimators are not specifically used in deep learning, the concept of bias reduction through the inclusion of underrepresented data points is relevant.

One technique used in deep learning to address bias during preprocessing is oversampling. Oversampling involves increasing the number of instances of the underrepresented class in the training data. This technique is useful when there is a class imbalance, and it helps to reduce bias towards the majority class. Similarly, the NN1 and NN2 estimators oversample the underrepresented sample trees and their neighbors by considering alternative neighbors in the calculations.

Another technique used in deep learning is undersampling, which involves reducing the number of instances of the majority class in the training data. This technique is useful when there is a class imbalance, and it helps to reduce bias towards the majority class. However, it may result in a loss of information.

In addition to oversampling and undersampling, diverse data collection is an essential technique used in deep learning to address bias. Diverse data collection involves gathering data from various sources, including underrepresented groups, to ensure that the training data is representative of the population. This technique helps to reduce bias towards any particular group and ensures that the model generalizes well to new data.

Finally, stratified splitting is a technique used in deep learning to ensure that the training, validation, and test data are representative of the population. Stratified splitting involves dividing the data into subgroups based on specific criteria, such as class labels, and then randomly sampling from each subgroup. This technique helps to ensure that each subset of the data is representative of the population and reduces bias towards any particular group.

In conclusion, while the provided context does not directly refer to data preprocessing in deep learning pipelines, the techniques used to address bias in forest inventory analysis, such as oversampling and diverse data collection, are relevant. Additionally, techniques such as undersampling and stratified splitting are commonly used in deep learning to address bias during preprocessing.
