Answer:::

The specific deep learning framework used to build the model described in the article "Water contamination analysis in IoT enabled aquaculture using deep learning based AODEGRU" is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. The authors, Peda Gopi Arepalli and K. Jairam Naik, developed a deep learning model for water contamination analysis in aquaculture using a variant of Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) called AODEGRU. However, they do not mention whether they used a popular deep learning library such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Theano to implement their model. Therefore, based on the given context, it is not possible to provide a definitive answer to this query.
