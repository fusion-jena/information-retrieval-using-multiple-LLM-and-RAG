Answer:::

The provided context does not include information about a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The texts mention various studies and models related to machine learning, vegetation, and remote sensing, but they do not give a direct reference to a data repository for a deep learning pipeline.

In the context, there are several studies that use machine learning techniques for vegetation analysis, such as Zeiler, M.D., Fergus, R. (2014), Zhang, X., Friedl, M.A., Schaaf, C.B., Strahler, A.H., Hodges, J.C., Gao, F., Reed, B.C., Huete, A. (2003), Zhang, B., Zhang, L., Xie, D., Yin, X., Liu, C., Liu, G. (2016), and Zhao, Y., Feng, Q., Lu, A. (2021). However, these studies do not mention a data repository link for their deep learning pipelines.

Similarly, the context includes references to various machine learning models and techniques, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), support vector machines (Hearst et al., 1998), boosted tree ensembles (e.g., XGBoost (Chen and Guestrin, 2016) or LightGBM (Ke et al., 2017)), and others. However, the context does not provide a data repository link for a deep learning pipeline that uses these models or techniques.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to give a specific answer to the query about the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline.
