Answer:::
The code repository for the deep learning pipeline is available on GitHub. You can access it using the following link: <https://github.com/BenMcEwen1/Sparse-Noise-Reduction>. This repository contains the implementation of the deep learning-based denoising method used in the study, which is a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) model. The code includes the implementation of the CGAN model, data preprocessing scripts, and evaluation scripts. The datasets used in the study are also publicly available and can be accessed at <https://zenodo.3243139> and <https://github.com/smarsland/AviaNZ>.

The deep learning-based denoising method used in the study is a CGAN model, which consists of an encoder and decoder section. The encoder produces a compressed latent space representation, and the decoder then uses this latent space to reconstruct the denoised waveform. The study also applied transformer attention mechanisms, which have been successful in deep noise reduction techniques.

Most deep noise reduction methods focus on NLP applications and are optimized for bandwidths ranging from 16 to 22 kHz. However, the sparsity of vocalisations in bioacoustics applications makes the development of large-scale datasets infeasible. Therefore, the study used two datasets, each containing 10 seconds of audio recordings. Dataset 1 consists of 1000 5-s samples recorded using Audiomoth microphones and downsampled to 16 kHz. Dataset 2 is a subset of AviaNZ's New Zealand Native birds dataset, containing 29 field recordings with bandwidths ranging up to 48 kHz.

In summary, the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study is available on GitHub, and the datasets used in the study are publicly available. The deep learning-based denoising method used in the study is a CGAN model with transformer attention mechanisms, which has been successful in deep noise reduction techniques. However, most deep noise reduction methods focus on NLP applications, and the sparsity of vocalisations in bioacoustics applications makes the development of large-scale datasets infeasible.
