The provided context discusses various aspects of deep learning model training, including strategies to prevent overfitting, but it does not explicitly mention dropout or L2 regularization. However, it does mention the use of validation performance monitoring and early stopping as a way to prevent overfitting.

Answer:
The provided context discusses the use of monitoring the model's validation performance as a method to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. Specifically, the "optimal" number of training epochs is determined by the one that provides the best validation performance. Additionally, the context suggests using a final test data set to evaluate the performance of the model having an "optimal" number of training epochs, which provides the best estimate of the predictive performance of the model. However, the context does not explicitly mention dropout or L2 regularization as regularization methods to prevent overfitting.

It's worth noting that dropout and L2 regularization are two common regularization techniques used in deep learning to prevent overfitting. Dropout involves randomly setting a fraction of the input units to zero during training, which helps to prevent over-reliance on any single unit and promotes the development of redundant representations within the network. L2 regularization, on the other hand, involves adding a penalty term to the loss function that is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the model's weights. This encourages the model to develop smaller, more conservative weights and can help to prevent overfitting.

In summary, while the provided context discusses the use of validation performance monitoring and early stopping as a way to prevent overfitting, it does not explicitly mention dropout or L2 regularization as regularization methods.
