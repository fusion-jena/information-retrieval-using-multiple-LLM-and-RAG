Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the preprocessing methodology for audio signals consists of three steps, one of which is normalization. Specifically, step 3 involves normalizing the signal amplitude.

In step 1, the audio signals are segmented into overlapping frames to capture temporal patterns. Then, in step 2, spectral features are extracted from each frame using a power spectral density (PSD) estimator, such as the Welch method. This step also includes applying a smoothing function to the PSD estimates to reduce variability.

In step 3, the signal amplitude is normalized. Signal amplitude refers to the magnitude of the audio signal, which can vary significantly depending on the microphone's manufacturing materials and level of degradation. As a result, normalizing the signal amplitude can help reduce variability and improve the performance of downstream analyses, such as deep learning models.

The context suggests using a standard normalization technique, such as z-score normalization, which involves subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the signal amplitude. This transforms the amplitude values to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which can help improve the convergence and accuracy of deep learning models.

Other preprocessing steps, such as scaling and cleaning, are not explicitly mentioned in the context. However, scaling is a related technique that can be used to transform features to a common range, such as between 0 and 1. Cleaning, on the other hand, typically refers to removing noise or artifacts from the signals, which is not explicitly mentioned in the context.

In summary, the preprocessing methodology for audio signals consists of three steps: segmenting the signals into frames, extracting spectral features from each frame, and normalizing the signal amplitude. Specifically, z-score normalization can be used to transform the amplitude values to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which can help improve the performance of deep learning models. Other preprocessing steps, such as scaling and cleaning, are not explicitly mentioned in the context.
