Answer:::

During the training of the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model for classifying migrating birds' flight calls, several strategies were implemented to monitor the model's performance.

Firstly, the model optimized the cross-entropy loss via mini-batch stochastic gradient descent. This allowed for the iterative adjustment of the model's parameters based on the performance on small batches of the training data. By monitoring the loss on the validation set after each epoch, the effectiveness of the model's optimization could be evaluated.

Secondly, a constant learning rate of 0.01 was used. This learning rate determines the step size at which the model's parameters are updated during optimization. By maintaining a constant learning rate, the model's performance could be monitored over time and adjustments could be made if necessary.

Thirdly, dropout was applied to the input of the last two layers with a probability of 0.5. Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the input units to zero during training. This helps to prevent overfitting and improves the model's generalization performance. By monitoring the model's performance with and without dropout, the impact of this regularization technique could be assessed.

Fourthly, L2-regularization was applied to the weights of the last two layers with a penalty factor of 0.001. L2-regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that encourages smaller weight values. This helps to further prevent overfitting and improves the model's interpretability. By monitoring the model's performance with and without L2-regularization, the impact of this regularization technique could be evaluated.

Finally, the model was trained for 100 epochs and checkpointed after each epoch. This allowed for the model's performance to be monitored over time and for the identification of the parameter setting (epoch) achieving the highest classification accuracy.

In summary, the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training involved the optimization of cross-entropy loss, the use of a constant learning rate, the application of dropout and L2-regularization, and the training and checkpointing of the model over time. These strategies allowed for the effective monitoring of the model's performance and the identification of the best parameter settings for classification.
