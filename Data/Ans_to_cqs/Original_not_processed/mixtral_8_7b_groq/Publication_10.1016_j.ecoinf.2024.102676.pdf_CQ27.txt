Answer:::

The provided context does not give detailed information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does offer some insights into the data preparation, model training, and evaluation stages.

First, the team worked on data curation, gathering data on Github and using professional tracking combined with community involvement through citizen science data collection of footprints. This data was then used to develop state-of-the-art machine learning models for monitoring endangered and elusive species.

In the model training phase, the team utilized methodologies like missing value imputation to handle incomplete footprints. This approach was recommended to preserve valuable data and improve the accuracy of FIT predictions when lower-quality footprints were included.

A study using deep learning models to classify three sympatric otter species was conducted, comparing a model trained on images of all qualities with a model trained only on high-quality prints. The results showed that utilizing lower-quality data effectively could yield only marginally inferior performance.

The context also mentions the usage of OpenAI's ChatGPT for spell checking, grammar checking, and debugging in code during the preparation of the work. However, it does not provide information on model serialization, platform selection, or the deployment of the trained deep learning model.

Answer:::
(In summary, while the provided context offers insights into data preparation and model training, it does not contain explicit information on the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model, such as model serialization and platform selection.)
