Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework was used to build the model. However, it does mention that the model was trained using the Google Colab Pro infrastructure, which supports various deep learning libraries including TensorFlow and PyTorch. Therefore, it can be inferred that either TensorFlow or PyTorch was used to build the deep learning model.
