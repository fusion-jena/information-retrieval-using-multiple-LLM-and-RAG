Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The context only mentions the use of the "covsel R package" for the embedded covariate selection procedure in species distribution modeling.

However, you can try searching for the "covsel" package on GitHub or other code repository platforms. Here's a possible approach:

1. Go to GitHub (github.com) and search for "covsel" in the search bar.
2. Check the repositories that appear in the search results. Look for a repository that is related to ecological informatics, species distribution modeling, or deep learning.
3. If you find a relevant repository, check the repository's documentation, readme file, or contribution guidelines for more information about the deep learning pipeline.

Remember that there is no guarantee that the "covsel" package includes the deep learning pipeline used in the study. If you cannot find the code repository link, you can contact the authors of the study for more information.
