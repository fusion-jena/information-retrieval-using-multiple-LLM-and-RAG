Answer:::

 Based on the information provided, there is no mention of a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link for it. The CRediT authorship contribution statement lists various contributions made by the authors, such as software, methodology, investigation, and formal analysis, but none of them specifically mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository.

 Additionally, the Data availability statement indicates that the authors do not have permission to share data. However, it does not mention anything about a code repository or a deep learning pipeline.

 Therefore, based on the given context, I cannot provide a code repository link for the deep learning pipeline.
