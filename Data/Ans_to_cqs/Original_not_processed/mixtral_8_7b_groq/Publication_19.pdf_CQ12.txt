Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the context provided, which mentions the use of CNN architectures such as Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, and EfficientNet for image classification. These models are all variants of CNNs, which are particularly suited for image and visual data analysis due to their ability to effectively extract features and learn spatial hierarchies. CNNs have been widely used in computer vision tasks, including image recognition, object detection, and segmentation, making them a popular choice for wildlife monitoring applications using camera traps.
