Based on the provided context, the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline include data augmentation and the use of a conservative score threshold for the CNN model.

Data augmentation is used to estimate the detection probability by adding a number of known "non-detections" with a distance of NA to the dataset of detected or simulated calls. This increases the total number of observations to 300 per ARU and allows for the modeling of the total realized number of calls, including false positive CNN detections, in relation to the data augmentation parameter Ïˆ, pi,j, and the binary detection outcomes of each call. This helps to account for any potential bias in the data by increasing the number of observations and providing a more representative sample.

Additionally, a conservative score threshold of 0.95 is used for the CNN model, where only calls that receive a score of 0.95 or higher are officially classified as a positive bobwhite detection. This threshold is chosen to minimize the number of false positive detections and reduce bias in the model's predictions.

It is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context if other techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection are used to address data bias during preprocessing. However, the focus on data augmentation and the use of a conservative score threshold suggests that these techniques are being used to ensure the accuracy and representativeness of the data.
