Answer:::
The text provided does not give a detailed explanation of the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. However, it does mention some steps that were taken as part of the overall process.

The models were implemented using TensorFlow, a Python framework that allows for efficient analysis and implementation of deep learning with Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). The experiments were conducted on a workstation with a 64-bit Intel i7-8700K@3.70GHz CPU, 64 GB memory, and an NVIDIAÂ® GTX 1080 GPU with 12Gb of memory, under a Debian 4.195.98-1 version operating system.

The training time for each method was recorded, as well as the inference time, which is the time taken by each model to make predictions for each image. The inference time was recorded for both GPU and CPU, and was also recorded per hectare (ha) of land.

Data augmentation was used to make the CNN classification more robust and generalize better. This was done by augmenting the dataset by six times using rotation, noise, and flip techniques.

After 50,000 iterations, the learning rate was reduced following an exponential decay parameter of 0.5 by an SGD scheduler. This was likely done to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model adjusts too well to the training data but does not generalize to unseen before datasets.

However, the text does not mention any steps related to model serialization or platform selection. Model serialization is the process of saving the trained model to disk so that it can be loaded and used later. Platform selection refers to choosing the hardware and software environment where the model will be deployed.

Therefore, while the text provides some information about the training and evaluation of the deep learning models, it does not give a complete picture of the process followed to deploy the trained model.
