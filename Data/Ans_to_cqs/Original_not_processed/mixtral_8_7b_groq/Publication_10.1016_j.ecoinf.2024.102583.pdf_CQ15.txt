Answer:::

The provided context discusses various machine learning models and techniques, including XGBoost and Support Vector Machines (SVM), but it does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or Adam.

Deep learning models often employ optimization techniques to minimize the loss function and improve model performance. Some common optimization techniques used in deep learning include:

1. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): SGD is a simple optimization algorithm that updates the model parameters by computing the gradient of the loss function for a single training example at a time.

2. Momentum: Momentum is an optimization technique that helps accelerate SGD in the relevant direction and dampens oscillations by incorporating the past gradients' momentum.

3. Adagrad: Adagrad is an optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate for each parameter by considering the historical gradient information.

4. Adadelta: Adadelta is an extension of Adagrad that addresses the diminishing learning rates problem by maintaining a moving window of the historical gradient information.

5. Adam: Adam is a popular optimization algorithm that combines the advantages of momentum and Adagrad by maintaining two separate moving averages for the gradient and squared gradient.

The context provided does mention XGBoost, which is a popular tree-based ensemble learning technique. XGBoost employs innovative optimization techniques, including regularization techniques like L1 and L2, to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting risks. However, these optimization techniques are specific to XGBoost and not deep learning pipelines.

Therefore, the optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as SGD, Momentum, Adagrad, Adadelta, and Adam, are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
