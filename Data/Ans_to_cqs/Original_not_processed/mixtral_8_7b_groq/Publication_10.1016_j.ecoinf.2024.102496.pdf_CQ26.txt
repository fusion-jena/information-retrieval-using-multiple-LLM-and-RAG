The provided context does not directly discuss the techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the importance of accurate data collection and consistent updating of input parameters in the PLET model, which is used to estimate current pollutant loads in watersheds. This suggests that diverse and representative data collection is crucial for the effectiveness of the tool.

In the context of deep learning, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, and undersampling can be used to address data bias during the preprocessing stage.

Stratified splitting is a method of splitting the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets while preserving the distribution of key variables in each set. This ensures that each set is representative of the overall dataset and helps to prevent bias in the model's performance.

Oversampling is a technique used to increase the representation of a minority class in the dataset. This can help to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class and improve its ability to generalize to new data.

Undersampling is a technique used to decrease the representation of a majority class in the dataset. This can help to prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class and improve its ability to generalize to new data.

Diverse data collection is a technique used to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population or phenomenon being studied. This can include collecting data from a variety of sources, locations, and demographics.

In addition, the context also highlights the need for future research to address and incorporate atmospheric deposition data for a more comprehensive assessment of pollutant sources in urban watersheds. This can be seen as a way of improving the diversity and representativeness of the data used in the model.

Answer:::
In summary, techniques such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and diverse data collection can be used to address data bias during the preprocessing stage of a deep learning pipeline. These techniques help to ensure that the dataset is representative of the population or phenomenon being studied and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data. Additionally, it is important to consider the diversity and representativeness of the data used in the model, as highlighted in the context provided.
