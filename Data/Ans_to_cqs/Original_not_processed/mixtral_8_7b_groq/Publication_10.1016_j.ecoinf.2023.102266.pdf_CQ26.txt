The provided context discusses the development and limitations of a classification model for predicting real-world phenomena, particularly focusing on the use of the Monte Carlo method and simulated climatic data. However, it does not directly mention any techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline.

In general, techniques used to address data bias during the preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline include:

1. Stratified splitting: This technique involves dividing the dataset into strata based on the distribution of specific features. During the splitting process, an equal number of samples from each stratum are included in both the training and testing sets. This ensures that the distribution of these features is preserved in both sets, reducing bias.

2. Oversampling: In cases where certain classes are underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling can be used to increase the number of instances from these classes. This can help prevent the deep learning model from being biased towards the majority class.

3. Undersampling: Conversely, if certain classes are overrepresented in the dataset, undersampling can be used to decrease the number of instances from these classes. This can help balance the dataset and prevent the model from being biased towards the majority class.

4. Diverse data collection: Collecting data from various sources and ensuring that the dataset is representative of the target population can help minimize bias. This includes considering factors such as geographical location, demographics, and other relevant variables.

While these techniques are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, they are commonly used in the preprocessing stage of deep learning pipelines to address data bias.
