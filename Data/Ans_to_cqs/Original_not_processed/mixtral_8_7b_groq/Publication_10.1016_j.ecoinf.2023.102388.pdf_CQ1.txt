The provided context does not directly discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does give some insight into how data is prepared and used in the context of query-based attacks on machine learning models.

In the process of conducting query-based attacks, researchers use a combination of reference images and adversarial perturbations to assess the membership of a given data sample. The reference images are selected randomly from a pool of supervised samples, with 25 images chosen per individual. This suggests that the data used in the attack dataset is likely obtained from a pre-existing supervised dataset, which could have been collected through various methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets.

In the context of deep learning pipelines, raw data can be collected through a variety of methods. Surveys can be used to collect data directly from individuals, while sensors can be used to collect data from the environment or from devices. Public datasets are also a common source of raw data for deep learning, as they provide large and diverse sets of data that can be used for training and testing models.

Once the raw data is collected, it is typically preprocessed and prepared for use in the deep learning pipeline. This may involve cleaning the data, normalizing it, and augmenting it with additional data to improve model performance. In the context of the provided text, the data is also used to create reference images for query-based attacks, and is potentially modified through adversarial perturbations.

Overall, while the provided context does not directly discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it does suggest that pre-existing supervised datasets are used in the process of conducting query-based attacks. In general, raw data for deep learning can be collected through various methods such as surveys, sensors, or public datasets, and is typically preprocessed and prepared for use in the pipeline.
