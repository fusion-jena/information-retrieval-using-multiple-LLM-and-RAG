Answer:

The provided context discusses the use of deep learning models in predicting soil organic carbon stock (SOCS) but does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps taken before training the model. However, it is generally recommended to perform certain preprocessing techniques such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning when working with numerical data in machine learning tasks, including deep learning.

Normalization and scaling are used to adjust the range of the input features to improve the model's performance. Normalization is the process of rescaling numeric data to a common range, often between 0 and 1. Scaling, on the other hand, involves resizing the numeric data to have a specific distribution, such as a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. These techniques can help prevent variables with large values from dominating the model's training process and improve the overall performance of the model.

Cleaning refers to the process of removing or correcting erroneous or missing data points from the dataset. This step is crucial as deep learning models are sensitive to the quality of the input data. Missing or incorrect data can lead to poor model performance or biased predictions.

Therefore, based on the general practices in machine learning, it is reasonable to assume that the following preprocessing steps were taken before training the deep learning model in the study:

1. Data cleaning: Removing or correcting any missing or erroneous data points from the dataset.
2. Normalization or scaling: Rescaling or resizing the input features to a common range or distribution.
3. Feature engineering: Selecting and transforming the relevant input features (environmental covariates) for the model.

These preprocessing steps are essential for improving the model's performance and ensuring the quality of the predictions.
