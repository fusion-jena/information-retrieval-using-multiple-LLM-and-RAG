Based on the provided context, there is no information on specific criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. The context consists of various scientific studies related to land use/cover change, climate change, carbon sink contribution, and vegetation health. While these studies discuss different methods and formulas for calculating various environmental factors, they do not provide information on training completion criteria for machine learning models.

In general, when training machine learning models, various criteria can be used to determine when training is complete. One common method is monitoring the validation loss and stopping the training process when the validation loss plateaus or starts to increase, indicating that the model is overfitting to the training data. Other criteria include using early stopping based on a predetermined number of epochs, monitoring the performance on a separate test dataset, or using learning rate schedules to adjust the learning rate during training.

Without more information specific to the context of the query, it is difficult to provide a precise answer. However, it is essential to monitor the performance of the model during training and use appropriate criteria to determine when training is complete to ensure the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.
