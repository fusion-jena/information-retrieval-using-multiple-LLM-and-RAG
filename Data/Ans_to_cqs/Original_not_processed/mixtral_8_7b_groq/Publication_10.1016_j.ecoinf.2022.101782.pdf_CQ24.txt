Answer:::

The provided context discusses a study that uses deep learning for image recognition of red kites, but it does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a random zoom between 0 and 0.2 for image augmentation, which is a common strategy for introducing randomness during training.

In general, there are several strategies that can be employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. One common method is the use of a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. By setting a specific seed value, the same initial random state can be generated for each run of the model, ensuring that the same set of random numbers is used for weight initialization, data shuffling, and other sources of randomness.

Another strategy for handling randomness is the use of dropout regularization. Dropout randomly sets a fraction of input units to zero during training, which helps prevent overfitting and improves the model's ability to generalize. By introducing randomness in this way, the model is forced to learn multiple different representations of the data, which can improve its performance.

Data augmentation is another common method for introducing randomness in the deep learning pipeline. This involves applying random transformations to the training data, such as rotation, scaling, or flipping. By augmenting the data in this way, the model is exposed to a wider variety of inputs, which can help improve its ability to generalize.

Batch normalization is another strategy that can help handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. This involves normalizing the inputs to each layer of the model, which can help reduce internal covariate shift and improve the model's convergence properties. By normalizing the inputs in this way, the model becomes less sensitive to the random initialization of weights and biases, which can improve its performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, there are several common methods that can be employed. These include the use of a random seed value, dropout regularization, data augmentation, and batch normalization. By introducing randomness in these ways, the model can be forced to learn multiple different representations of the data, which can improve its ability to generalize and prevent overfitting.
