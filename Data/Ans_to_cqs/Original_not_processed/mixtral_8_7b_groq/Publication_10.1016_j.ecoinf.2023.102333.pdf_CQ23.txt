Based on the provided context, there is no explicit mention of measures such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, there are some indications of efforts made to evaluate the model's performance and accuracy.

Firstly, the optimization process considered the model's accuracy when tested using the validation dataset, which suggests that a separate validation dataset was used to assess the model's performance. This is a step towards ensuring the model's ability to generalize, as it allows for the evaluation of the model on unseen data.

Secondly, after training the three main DNN models for 200 epochs, an overall accuracy measure was conducted using the validation dataset. This provides an assessment of the model's accuracy at a global level. Additionally, a confusion matrix was produced to highlight the accuracy of each class, and three quality metrics were added: Overall Accuracy (OA), Producer Accuracy (PA), and User Accuracy (UA). These metrics offer a more detailed view of the model's performance, going beyond just the global accuracy.

However, these measures do not explicitly mention the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Diverse dataset refers to the inclusion of various types of data to represent the real-world scenarios better. Cross-validation is a technique to assess how the results of a model will generalize to an independent dataset. Stratified splitting is a method of dividing the data into subgroups that maintain the original data's distribution.

In conclusion, while the provided context indicates efforts to evaluate the model's performance and accuracy, it does not explicitly mention the use of diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the model's generalizability.
