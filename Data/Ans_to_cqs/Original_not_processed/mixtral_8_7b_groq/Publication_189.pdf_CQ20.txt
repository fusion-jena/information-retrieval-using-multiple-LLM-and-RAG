Answer:::
The deep learning model was implemented and trained on a machine with one GPU. No information about the specific type or model of the GPU was provided. The system used one image per GPU for training, and the batch size for Mask R-CNN training was taken as the product of the number of GPUs and images per GPU. Therefore, in this case, the batch size would be equal to the number of training images, as there is only one GPU and one image used per GPU. No other hardware resources, such as TPUs (Tensor Processing Units), were mentioned as being used for training the model.
