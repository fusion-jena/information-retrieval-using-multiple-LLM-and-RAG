Answer:::
The hardware platform used for training the deep learning model consists of a desktop computer with 128G memory, 16 core and 32 thread CPU, 3.40 GHz frequency, and 24G GPU. Specifically, the deep learning platform TensorFlow 2.6 is used in conjunction with Python 3.7, and the computations are offloaded to the GPU. This is evident from the fact that the hardware platform includes a 24G GPU, which is a common hardware resource used for training deep learning models. The use of a GPU is crucial for training deep learning models as it can significantly speed up the computations compared to a CPU. This is because GPUs are designed to handle parallel computations efficiently, which is a key requirement for training deep learning models.
