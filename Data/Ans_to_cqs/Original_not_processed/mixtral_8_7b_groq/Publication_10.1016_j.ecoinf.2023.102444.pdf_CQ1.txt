Answer:::

The provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for this study. However, it does mention that bioclimatic variables were extracted from raster layers at a global level, representing ecological conditions for the environment and species locations. These layers were downloaded from the WorldClim v2.1 dataset at a resolution of 2.5 min (<https://www.worldclim.org/data/index.html>). These bioclimatic variables are commonly used in Species Distribution Models (SDM) and are derived from temperature and precipitation data from 1970-2000.

Additionally, the context references other studies that have used remote sensing imagery and convolutional neural networks for species distribution modeling. These studies likely used remote sensing data collected by satellites or other aerial platforms as raw data in their deep learning pipelines.

In general, for species distribution modeling, raw data can be collected through various methods such as field surveys, remote sensing imagery, and public datasets. Field surveys can include various techniques such as point counts, transects, and quadrats to collect data on species occurrence and abundance. Remote sensing imagery can provide information on land cover, vegetation, temperature, and other environmental variables that can be used to model species distributions. Public datasets, such as those provided by government agencies or research institutions, can also be a valuable source of raw data for species distribution modeling.

In summary, while the provided context does not give specific information about the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline for this study, it is mentioned that bioclimatic variables were extracted from raster layers and it can be inferred that other studies in the field have used remote sensing imagery and public datasets. Additionally, for species distribution modeling, raw data can be collected through various methods such as field surveys, remote sensing imagery, and public datasets.
