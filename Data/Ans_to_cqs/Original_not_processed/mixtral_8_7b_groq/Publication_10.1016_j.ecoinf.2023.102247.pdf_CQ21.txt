Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there are no specific postprocessing steps mentioned after the model training for the ensemble modeling approach used in the study by Shirk et al., 2018. However, the study does mention some of the steps involved in the modeling process.

First, the authors employed an ensemble modeling approach in the BIOMOD2 package in R to predict the distribution of the study species. This approach involved weight-averaging four different models, including one regression-based model and three machine-learning models (MaxEnt, RF, and SVM), to generate a final ensembled model for each species.

Next, to test for model performance, the authors employed cross-validation by using 70% of the dataset as training data to build the models and the other 30% as testing data to calculate the modelsâ€™ accuracy. The Area Under the Receiving Operator Characteristics Curve (AUC) was used as the index to specify the accuracy of the models.

Therefore, based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training could include calculating various metrics such as AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and generating a confusion matrix. However, these steps are not explicitly mentioned in the study.

It is worth noting that other studies may include additional postprocessing steps such as generating saliency maps, which highlight the most important features contributing to the model's predictions. Saliency maps can be useful for understanding which variables have the most significant impact on the model's predictions and for identifying areas of uncertainty.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training, it is common practice to calculate various metrics and generate confusion matrices. Other studies may also include additional postprocessing steps such as generating saliency maps.
