Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific methods used for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search. However, it does offer information about some of the hyperparameters used during the model's training process.

A learning rate of 0.0001 was utilized throughout the training process, which lasted for 300 epochs. The batch size was set to 24 data instances. These choices of learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size were possibly determined based on prior knowledge, empirical testing, or literature review, but the specific optimization method was not specified.

To prevent data snooping bias, the dataset was divided chronologically into a training set (70%), a validation set (10%), and a test set (20%). This allocation strategy helps enhance the model's generalizability by ensuring that the data in the validation and test sets differ from the training set data.

The model was implemented and tested on a Windows 11 operating system using Python 3.8, with a 12th-Gen Intel Core i7-12700H GPU at 2.30 GHz and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 GPU. The specific choice of hardware might have influenced the model's performance and training time, but it does not directly relate to the hyperparameter optimization method.

In summary, while the provided context offers information about some hyperparameters and the dataset allocation strategy, it does not explicitly mention the use of grid search, random search, or any other specific hyperparameter optimization method.
