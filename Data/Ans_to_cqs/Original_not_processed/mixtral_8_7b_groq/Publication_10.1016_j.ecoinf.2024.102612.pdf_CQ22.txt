Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model include Mean Accuracy (MA), Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU), and Overall Accuracy. These metrics are used to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, as well as to consider the individual values for each class within the dataset and compute their average. This approach enhances the reliability of the classification results for imbalanced data. Specifically, MIoU is used to determine the point at which the model attained optimal performance. After training the model over 1000 epochs, the configuration weights that achieved the best classification performance were selected based on MIoU or MA metrics. These metrics were computed after each epoch to analyze the training performance. The selected model was then used to perform predictions on real MS point clouds, which were taken as inputs for the decision tree scheme to retrieve the final fuel models.
