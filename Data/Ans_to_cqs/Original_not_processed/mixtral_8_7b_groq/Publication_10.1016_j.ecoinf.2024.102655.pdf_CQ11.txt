Answer:::

I regret to inform you that the provided context does not include the data repository link of the deep learning pipeline. The text describes a study involving data pre-processing, machine learning models, and the evaluation of those models for water quality prediction in a polluted river. However, it does not specify where the data or the deep learning pipeline can be accessed. Therefore, I am unable to provide the requested link. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
