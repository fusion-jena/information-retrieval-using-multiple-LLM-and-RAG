Answer:::
The provided context does not give information about the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The authors have mentioned the use of PyTorch 1.7.1 platform for the deep learning environment and have provided details about the computing platform, optimizer, and hyper-parameter settings for model training. However, there is no information about where the code for the deep learning pipeline is available, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
