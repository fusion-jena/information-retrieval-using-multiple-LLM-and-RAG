Based on the provided context, there is no mention of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. Instead, the text describes a method for generating redescriptions, which are essentially combinations of queries over dental and climate variables, with the goal of capturing local patterns in the data.

The method involves setting several parameters or hyperparameters, but they are related to controlling the size and complexity of the output redescriptions, rather than a deep learning model. These parameters include thresholds on the size of the support of the output redescriptions and the length and complexity of their queries. Specifically, the method requires that at least 1% of localities satisfy both queries (MinSuppIn) and that at least 30% of localities satisfy neither of the queries (MinSuppOut). Additionally, the method allows for tightening the requirement of accuracy gain by requiring that a candidate query can be extended only if the accuracy, as measured by the Jaccard coefficient, increases by at least 0.1.

Therefore, the hyperparameters mentioned in the text are related to controlling the size and complexity of the output redescriptions, rather than a deep learning model.
