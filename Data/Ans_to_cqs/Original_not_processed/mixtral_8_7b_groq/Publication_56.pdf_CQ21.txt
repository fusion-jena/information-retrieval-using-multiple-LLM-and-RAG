Based on the provided context, there are no specific details mentioned about the postprocessing steps involved after training the model. However, it is common to calculate various metrics, generate saliency maps, and create a confusion matrix as part of the evaluation process.

Metrics calculation usually includes assessing the performance of the model using measures such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and Cohen's kappa. These metrics help in understanding the overall performance and the class-wise performance of the model.

Saliency maps are a way to visualize the importance of input features in making predictions. They highlight the regions of the input that have the most influence on the model's output. Saliency maps can be useful for interpreting the model's decision-making process and identifying potential biases or issues in the data.

A confusion matrix is a table that summarizes the performance of a classification model. It compares the predicted classes with the actual classes, providing information about true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. From the confusion matrix, one can calculate additional metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

In the context of the provided information, the model in question is a 2-layer bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory network (2-BiLSTM) for land use classification. After training the model, it is likely that the authors calculated various metrics to assess the performance of the model. However, the text does not explicitly mention any postprocessing steps such as generating saliency maps or creating a confusion matrix.
