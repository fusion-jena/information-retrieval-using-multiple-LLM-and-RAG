Answer:::

The provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does discuss the use of data splitting in machine learning (ML) models, which can help manage randomness in data preprocessing.

In the context provided, the WQ indicator data was divided into training and testing datasets using an 80-20 split ratio. This means that 80% of the data was used for training the ML models, and the remaining 20% was used for testing the models' performance. The randomness in data splitting was managed by selecting 20 and 10 random sample locations for training and testing, respectively.

While this approach does not directly address the randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does help ensure that the models are not overfitting to the training data, which can be a significant issue in deep learning. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, and performs poorly on new, unseen data. By using a separate testing dataset, the models' performance can be evaluated on new data, helping to identify and mitigate overfitting.

In addition, some deep learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, allow users to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility in the training process. By setting a seed value, the random initialization of weights and biases in the neural network can be controlled, ensuring that the same model will be produced each time the training process is run. This can help manage randomness in the deep learning pipeline and ensure that the results are reproducible.

Therefore, while the provided context does not directly discuss strategies for handling randomness in deep learning pipelines, it does provide insights into managing randomness in data preprocessing and suggests the use of a random seed value in deep learning frameworks for reproducibility.
