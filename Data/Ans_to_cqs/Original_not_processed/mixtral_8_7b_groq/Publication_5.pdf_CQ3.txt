The provided context does not include specific information on the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for remote sensing or environmental data. However, it does mention the use of deep learning models for tasks such as image segmentation (67) and predicting Arctic sea ice concentrations using satellite and reanalysis data (68). In these applications, the deep learning models likely require annotated data for training, but the specific annotation techniques are not discussed.

In the context of computer vision and image processing, common data annotation techniques for deep learning include:

1. Image labeling: Assigning a class label to an entire image.
2. Bounding box annotation: Drawing a bounding box around an object of interest in an image and assigning a class label to the object.
3. Semantic segmentation: Dividing an image into multiple regions, each corresponding to a specific class label.
4. Instance segmentation: Identifying and segmenting individual instances of objects within an image, allowing for multiple objects of the same class to be distinguished and labeled separately.

For remote sensing and environmental data, data annotation techniques may include:

1. Pixel-wise labeling: Assigning a class label to each pixel in a remote sensing image.
2. Object-based image analysis (OBIA): Segmenting an image into objects based on spectral, textural, and/or spatial characteristics, and then labeling each object with a class.
3. Polygon annotation: Drawing a polygon around a region of interest in a remote sensing image and assigning a class label to the region.

It is important to note that the choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the nature of the data. In some cases, a combination of techniques may be used to improve model performance.

In summary, while the provided context does not specifically mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline for remote sensing or environmental data, common techniques for computer vision and image processing include image labeling, bounding box annotation, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation. For remote sensing and environmental data, pixel-wise labeling, object-based image analysis, and polygon annotation are common techniques. The choice of data annotation technique depends on the specific task and the nature of the data.
