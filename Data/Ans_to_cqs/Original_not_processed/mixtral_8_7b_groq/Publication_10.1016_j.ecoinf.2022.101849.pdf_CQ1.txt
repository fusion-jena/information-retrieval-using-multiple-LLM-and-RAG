The provided context does not directly discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of various types of data in different weakly supervised learning settings.

In the context of predictive modeling of global vegetation cover, it is likely that remote sensing data from satellites or aerial surveys are used as raw data. For example, the reference "Vaca, R.A., Golicher, D.J., Cayuela, L., 2011. Using climatically based random forests to downscale coarse-grained potential natural vegetation maps in tropical Mexico" mentions the use of coarse-grained potential natural vegetation maps, which suggests the use of remote sensing data.

In the context of semi-supervised learning, public datasets are often used as raw data. For example, the reference "Van Engelen, J.E., Hoos, H.H., 2020. A survey on semi-supervised learning" mentions the use of semi-supervised learning for image classification, which suggests the use of public image datasets such as ImageNet.

In the context of weakly supervised learning, it is likely that a combination of public datasets and sensors are used as raw data. For example, the reference "Xu, Y., Zhu, J.Y., Eric, I., Chang, C., Lai, M., Tu, Z., 2014. Weakly supervised histopathology cancer image segmentation and classification" mentions the use of weakly supervised learning for histopathology cancer image segmentation and classification, which suggests the use of both public medical image datasets and sensor data from medical imaging devices.

Another example, "Yao, X., Han, J., Cheng, G., Qian, X., Guo, L., 2016. Semantic annotation of high-resolution satellite images via weakly supervised learning" mentions the use of weakly supervised learning for semantic annotation of high-resolution satellite images, which suggests the use of both public satellite image datasets and sensor data from satellite sensors.

In summary, while the provided context does not directly discuss the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that a combination of surveys, sensors, and public datasets are used depending on the specific task and setting.
