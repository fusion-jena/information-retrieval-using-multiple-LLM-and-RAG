Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the specific location of the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in this study. The study mentions that the convolutional neural network (CNN) was implemented in MATLAB, but it does not specify where the code can be accessed. Similarly, the classical machine learning algorithms were run in Python using the scikit-learn toolbox, but the location of the code is not provided.

In order to access the code, it would be necessary to contact the authors of the study directly and inquire about the availability and location of the code repository. They may have made it available on a platform such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, or they may be willing to share the code directly.

It is important to note that making code publicly available is a best practice in scientific research, as it allows other researchers to reproduce and build upon the work. By sharing their code, the authors can contribute to the larger scientific community and promote transparency and reproducibility in their research.
