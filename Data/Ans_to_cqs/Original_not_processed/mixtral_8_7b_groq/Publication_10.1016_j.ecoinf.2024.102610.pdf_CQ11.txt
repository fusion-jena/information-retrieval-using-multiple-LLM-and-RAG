Unfortunately, the provided pieces of context do not include information about a specific deep learning pipeline or a data repository link associated with it. The Keshavamurthy et al. (2022) paper is a systematic review of machine learning and deep learning approaches for predicting infectious diseases, but it does not provide a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link.

The Khun (2022) paper discusses the 'caret' package for classification and regression training in R, but it does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The Laaksonen et al. (2017) paper discusses a crowdsourcing-based nationwide tick collection in Finland, but it does not involve a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link.

The 'VSURF' package in CRAN repository is used for variable selection in high-dimensional data, but it does not provide a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The Gonz´alez Jim´enez et al. (2019) paper discusses the prediction of mosquito species and population age structure using mid-infrared spectroscopy and supervised machine learning, but it does not involve a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link.

The Greenwell (2022) paper discusses the 'pdp' package for partial dependence plots, but it does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. The provided funding sources and projects, such as Innovative solutions for Decision Agriculture, TerraClimate, Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station Data, and MODIS, do not provide a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link.

Therefore, I cannot provide a data repository link for the deep learning pipeline as it is not mentioned in the provided pieces of context.
