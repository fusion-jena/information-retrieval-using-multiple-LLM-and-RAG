Answer:::

The text does not provide specific information about strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as the use of a random seed value. However, it does mention the use of deep learning techniques, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for tasks such as semantic segmentation of plant cover and plant species identification. These tasks involve making predictions for individual pixels or image regions, and the CNNs used for these tasks are typically trained on labeled data.

One potential source of randomness in the deep learning pipeline is the initialization of the weights and biases in the network. This initialization can be done randomly, and different random initializations can lead to different training outcomes. To address this, it is common to use a fixed random seed value when initializing the network, so that the same random initialization is used each time the network is trained. This can help to ensure that any differences in training outcomes are due to differences in the data or the training procedure, rather than differences in the initial random initialization.

Another potential source of randomness is the selection of training examples for each iteration of the training process. In many deep learning algorithms, a subset of the training data is selected at random for each iteration, and this subset is used to update the weights and biases in the network. This process is known as stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and it can help to reduce the computational cost of training the network by allowing the network to be updated using a smaller subset of the data. However, the use of SGD can also introduce randomness into the training process, as different subsets of the data are selected at each iteration. To address this, it is common to use multiple passes through the training data (known as epochs) and to average the results over these passes. This can help to reduce the impact of any randomness introduced by the selection of training examples.

Overall, while the text does not provide specific information about strategies used to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it is likely that common techniques such as the use of a fixed random seed value and multiple passes through the training data are used to ensure the reproducibility and stability of the training process.
