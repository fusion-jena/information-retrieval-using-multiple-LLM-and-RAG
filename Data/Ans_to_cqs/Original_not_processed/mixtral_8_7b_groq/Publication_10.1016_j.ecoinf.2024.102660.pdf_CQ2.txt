Answer: Based on the provided context, the deep learning pipeline in this study uses image data format. More specifically, it utilizes water surface images acquired by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to train and test the Res_AUNet network for water sun glint detection.

The study begins with collecting UAV-acquired water surface images, which are then preprocessed to a uniform size of 256 Ã— 256 pixels. This cropping process results in a total of 1764 image pairs. These image pairs are further divided into three sets: 1232 image pairs for training the deep neural network, 176 image pairs for validating the model accuracy during the training phase, and 356 image pairs for testing the performance of the trained network post-training.

In the Res_AUNet network, the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated into the encoding-decoding skip connections to better capture the distinctive semantic features associated with water sun glint. The network is trained and evaluated using the Water Sun Glint Dataset (WSGD), achieving high accuracy, F1-score, and Intersection over Union (IOU) metrics.

Therefore, the deep learning pipeline in this study primarily uses image data format, specifically UAV-acquired water surface images, for training and testing the Res_AUNet network for water sun glint detection.
