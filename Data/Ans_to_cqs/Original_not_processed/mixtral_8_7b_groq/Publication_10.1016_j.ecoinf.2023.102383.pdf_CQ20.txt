The context provided does not give information about the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It mainly focuses on the architecture and performance of the model, specifically a feature extractor based on Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and ResNet152 for animal recognition and counting in UAV thermal images. The text mentions that compressed feature maps with different resolutions are extracted from the original image and assigned to regions of interest (RoIs) with varying sizes. Deeper layers of the model may have fewer pixels representing objects, leading to a loss of fine details. However, the model with more layers, FRC\_ResNet152FPN, obtains the best detection AP for objects of different sizes.

Although the text does not mention any hardware resources, it can be inferred that the training process might require high-performance computational resources, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), to handle large UAV thermal images, extract features, and train the deep learning model efficiently. These hardware resources can accelerate the computations and memory-intensive tasks required for deep learning, enabling faster training times and better model performance. However, the specific hardware resources used for training the model in this case remain unknown based on the provided context.
