Based on the provided context, there is no explicit information about the use of diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. In fact, the context does not directly mention a deep learning model at all. Instead, it discusses a classification model built upon the Monte Carlo method.

However, the authors do take steps to ensure the model's applicability to various real-world phenomena. They do this by simulating climatic data with a uniform distribution for the parameters θ and ρ. This approach allows them to consider a wide range of climatic conditions and potential wind-driven events, reducing the risk of bias in their study.

Additionally, the authors use an arbitrary partition P to make the model a powerful tool for predicting real-world phenomena. This partitioning might help increase the model's applicability to various situations.

In summary, while the provided context does not explicitly mention deep learning models or common techniques for improving generalizability like diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting, the authors do employ strategies to increase the model's applicability to various real-world phenomena.
