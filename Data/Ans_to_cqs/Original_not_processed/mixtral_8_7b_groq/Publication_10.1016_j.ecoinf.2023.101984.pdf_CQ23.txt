Answer:::

Based on the provided context, there is no information about a deep learning model. The model mentioned is a MaxEnt (Maximum Entropy) model, which is a type of machine learning model commonly used for species distribution modeling. Therefore, I cannot provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model.

However, I can provide some general measures that are often used to ensure the generalizability of machine learning models, including the MaxEnt model:

1. Diverse dataset: A diverse dataset, which includes a wide range of variations in the input variables, can help the model to learn more robust patterns and improve its ability to generalize to new data.
2. Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the performance and generalizability of a machine learning model. It involves dividing the dataset into several subsets, training the model on one subset, and testing it on another subset. This process is repeated for each subset, providing an estimate of the model's performance on new data.
3. Stratified splitting: Stratified splitting is a technique used to divide a dataset into training and testing subsets while preserving the distribution of the input variables. This can help to ensure that the training and testing subsets are representative of the overall dataset and improve the model's ability to generalize to new data.

Based on the provided context, the MaxEnt model's output was analyzed using the jackknife and permutation importance methods. These methods can help to assess the relative contributions of the input variables to the model and identify which variables are most important for predicting the species distribution. However, these methods do not directly address the generalizability of the model.

Therefore, while the provided context includes information on the analysis of the MaxEnt model's output, it does not provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
