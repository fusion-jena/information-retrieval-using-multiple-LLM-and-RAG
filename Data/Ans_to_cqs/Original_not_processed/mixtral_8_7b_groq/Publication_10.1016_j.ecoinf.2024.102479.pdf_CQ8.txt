Answer:::

Based on the information provided, there is no mention of a specific code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The sources mainly focus on the methodology, results, and applications of the study, which involves the use of various machine learning algorithms for predicting aboveground biomass and productivity in Mediterranean forests of South Spain.

The algorithms mentioned in the table include Random Forest, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, Penalized Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, Artificial Neural Network, and k-Nearest Neighbors. However, there is no information about the implementation of these algorithms in a code repository.

It is possible that the code repository is not publicly available or was not included in the sources provided. If you are interested in implementing these algorithms, you can refer to the documentation and packages available for each algorithm. For instance, the 'neuralnet' package in R can be used for implementing Artificial Neural Networks, and the 'randomForest' package can be used for implementing Random Forests.

In summary, while the sources provide valuable information on the application of machine learning algorithms for predicting aboveground biomass and productivity, there is no information on the code repository for the deep learning pipeline used in the study.
