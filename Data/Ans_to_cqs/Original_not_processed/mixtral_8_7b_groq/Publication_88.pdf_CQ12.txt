Answer:::

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the description of the EF network architecture, which consists of three convolutional layers (Conv), two max-pooling layers (MaxPool), and two fully connected layers (FC) with a softmax layer at the end. The CSVM method also includes convolutional layers in its architecture, which are followed by max-pooling layers. The SN architecture is not explicitly described in terms of convolutional layers, but it is mentioned that each subnetwork is composed of three convolutional layers. Therefore, it can be inferred that the SN architecture also includes convolutional layers. This is consistent with the use of the term "subnetworks," which suggests that the SN model is a type of CNN. In summary, the EF, CSVM, and SN models all use convolutional layers, which are a key component of CNNs. Therefore, it can be concluded that a CNN is used in the pipeline.
