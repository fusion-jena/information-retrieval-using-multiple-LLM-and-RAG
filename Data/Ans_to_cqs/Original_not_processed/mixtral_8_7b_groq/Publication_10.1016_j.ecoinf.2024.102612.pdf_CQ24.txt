Answer:::

The provided context does not contain explicit information about strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of a random seed value in the context of training a convolutional neural network model for wildfire spread prediction.

In the study "Convolutional neural network model for wildfire spread prediction" by Mihajlovski et al., 2023, the authors used Keras, a popular deep learning library, to build their model. Keras allows the user to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. By setting a seed value, the random number generator used in the training process is initialized in a specific way, and the same sequence of random numbers is generated in every run. This ensures that the same initial weights are used in the network, and the same data splits are created for training, validation, and testing, leading to consistent results.

Therefore, one strategy to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline is to set a random seed value. This ensures that the training process is reproducible and that the same results are obtained in different runs of the model.

Moreover, in the study "Wildfire response of forest species from multispectral LiDAR data. A deep learning approach with synthetic data" by ComesaËœna-Cebral et al., 2023, the authors used synthetic data to train their deep learning model. Synthetic data can help reduce the impact of randomness in the training process since it allows for the generation of large and diverse datasets that can cover a wide range of variations in the input data.

In summary, while the provided context does not contain extensive information on strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, it does mention the use of a random seed value in Keras and the use of synthetic data to reduce the impact of randomness.
