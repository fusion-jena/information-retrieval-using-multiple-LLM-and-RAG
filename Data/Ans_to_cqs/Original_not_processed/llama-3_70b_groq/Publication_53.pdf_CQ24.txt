Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The text focuses on the application of deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNN) for detecting farm dams in Australia, and the statistical analyses performed using Python, R, and various packages.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to set a random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This is because many deep learning algorithms involve random processes, such as initialization of model weights, shuffling of training data, and random sampling of batches. By setting a random seed value, researchers can ensure that their results are reproducible and comparable across different runs of the experiment.

In the context of this study, it is likely that the authors employed some strategy to handle randomness, but the details are not provided. It is possible that they used a fixed random seed value, or employed other techniques such as data augmentation or ensemble methods to mitigate the effects of randomness. However, without further information, it is not possible to determine the specific strategies employed.
