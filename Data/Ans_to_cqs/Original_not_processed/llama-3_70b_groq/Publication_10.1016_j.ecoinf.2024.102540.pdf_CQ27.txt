Answer:::

The process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that a containerization system, specifically Docker, was used to build and deploy the containerized application to Google Cloud Run. This implies that the model was likely containerized using Docker and then deployed to Google Cloud Run, but the exact steps involved in model serialization and platform selection are not specified.

It can be inferred that the best-trained model was used to build a web application to detect alates on sorghum leaves automatically, which is open-source and available. However, the details of how the model was serialized and deployed to the platform are not provided.

In summary, while we know that Docker and Google Cloud Run were used for deployment, the exact process followed for model serialization and platform selection is not specified in the provided context.
