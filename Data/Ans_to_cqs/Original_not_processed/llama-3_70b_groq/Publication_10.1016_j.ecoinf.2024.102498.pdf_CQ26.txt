Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on evaluating the performance improvement of a fusion approach compared to pixel-based and object-based classification approaches, and it discusses the use of different algorithms such as GTB and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for land use and land cover (LULC) classification. 

However, it does mention that the study initially faced challenges due to limited access to the study area, time constraints, and the complexity of different classes. To address this, 15 apprentices were trained, and high-resolution images from Google Earth were utilized to collect appropriate labels. Two experts further reviewed the collected labels to ensure quality and accuracy. This suggests that the study took steps to ensure the quality and accuracy of the collected data, but it does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
