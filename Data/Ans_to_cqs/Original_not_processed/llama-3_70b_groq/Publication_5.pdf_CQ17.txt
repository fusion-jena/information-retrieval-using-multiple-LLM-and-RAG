Answer:::

Based on the provided context, one of the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. This is mentioned in reference 66, which states "Dropout: A simple way to prevent neural networks from overfitting." However, there is no mention of L2 regularization or any other regularization methods in the provided context.

It's worth noting that the context does not provide a comprehensive overview of the deep learning pipeline or regularization methods used in the specific model being discussed. Therefore, it's possible that other regularization methods may have been used, but they are not mentioned in the provided context.

In general, dropout is a popular regularization method used to prevent overfitting in deep neural networks. It works by randomly dropping out neurons during training, which helps to prevent the model from relying too heavily on any single neuron or group of neurons. This can help to improve the model's generalizability and reduce overfitting.
