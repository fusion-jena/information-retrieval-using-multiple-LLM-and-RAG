Answer:::
The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It describes the architecture of the baseline model and mentions that different methods were explored to enhance the neural network with contextual information, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques such as grid search or random search. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
