Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. This is mentioned in the text as "To avoid overfitting, a dropout layer is added." The dropout layer is described as a regularization method that randomly excludes some inputs from activation and weight updates while training a network. 

There is no mention of L2 regularization in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the authors used a different regularization method, the elastic net, in a separate reference (Zou, H., Hastie, T., 2005). But this is not directly related to the deep learning pipeline described in the context.

Therefore, the answer is that the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout.
