Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the use of 2D CNNs for bird vocalization recognition, transfer learning, and fine-tuning with limited labeled data from the study domain. It also mentions the use of mel-spectrograms as input features for the CNN models. However, it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used to prepare the training data for these models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
