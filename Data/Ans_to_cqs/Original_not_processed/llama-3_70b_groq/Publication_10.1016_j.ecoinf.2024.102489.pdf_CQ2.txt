Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in a deep learning pipeline. The context primarily discusses the use of satellite image data, specifically MODIS products and Landsat data, for estimating Leaf Area Index (LAI) using machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) models. There is no mention of audio or video data formats. 

However, it can be inferred that image data is used in the pipeline, given the context of satellite imagery and LAI estimation. But the specific format of the image data (e.g., TIFF, JPEG, GeoTIFF) is not mentioned. Additionally, there is no mention of CSV files or any other data formats being used in the pipeline.
