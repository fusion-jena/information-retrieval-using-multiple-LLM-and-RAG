Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on the conversion of audio clips to spectrograms, the architecture of the convolutional neural network (CNN), and the performance of the model on a test dataset. It does not provide information about the optimization techniques used to train the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
