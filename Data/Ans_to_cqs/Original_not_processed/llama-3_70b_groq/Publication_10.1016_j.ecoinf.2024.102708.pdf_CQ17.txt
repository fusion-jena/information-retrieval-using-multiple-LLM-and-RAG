Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on object detection models, such as YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN, and their performance in detecting Pacific oysters. It discusses the differences in model complexity, training data, and pre-training on specific imagery, but it does not provide information on regularization methods.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
