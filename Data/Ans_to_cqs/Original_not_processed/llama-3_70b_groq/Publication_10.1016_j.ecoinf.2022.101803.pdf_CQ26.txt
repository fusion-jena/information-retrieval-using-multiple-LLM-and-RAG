Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on ensemble methods, such as bagging and boosting, and their applications in machine learning models. It discusses the importance of ensemble size, nested k-fold cross-validation, and block cross-validation to address overfitting and autocorrelation issues.

However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. These techniques are commonly used to handle imbalanced datasets and ensure that the model is trained on a representative sample of the population.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
