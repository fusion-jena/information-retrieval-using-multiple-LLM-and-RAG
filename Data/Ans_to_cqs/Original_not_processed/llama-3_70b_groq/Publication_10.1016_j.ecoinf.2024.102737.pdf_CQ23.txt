Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it can be inferred that the dataset used for training and testing is diverse in terms of pose, contrast, brightness, and other image characteristics. The training set includes 21 different individuals (classes) each having 4 different 320 Ã— 320 pixels images, and the test set includes 99 other labeled images of the individuals that appeared in the training set. This suggests that the dataset is diverse, but it is not clear if cross-validation or stratified splitting were used.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the use of different architectures and loss functions, such as Contrastive Loss, which may help improve the generalizability of the model. However, without explicit information, it is difficult to say for certain what measures were taken to ensure generalizability.

In summary, while the dataset appears to be diverse, it is unclear if cross-validation or stratified splitting were used, and more information is needed to determine the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
