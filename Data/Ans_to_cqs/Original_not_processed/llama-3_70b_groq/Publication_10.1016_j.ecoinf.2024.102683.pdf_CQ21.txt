Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the model architecture, data splitting, and evaluation metrics, but it does not provide information about specific postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. 

However, it can be inferred that some metrics calculation is involved, as the context mentions the evaluation of models based on various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score. But the exact postprocessing steps are not specified.
