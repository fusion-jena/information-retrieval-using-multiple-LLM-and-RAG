Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or specific frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context discusses machine learning models, specifically random forest and maximum entropy modeling (Maxent), and their applications in ecological studies. It also mentions a R package, but it does not provide information about deep learning frameworks. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
