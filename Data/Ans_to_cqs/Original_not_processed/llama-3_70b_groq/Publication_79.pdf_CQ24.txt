Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context appears to be focused on the application of deep learning techniques for hierarchical mapping of Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado) physiognomies using remote sensing data. It discusses the performance of different deep learning models and their ability to classify various vegetation classes.

However, in general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines is crucial to ensure reproducibility and consistency of results. Some common strategies employed to handle randomness include:

1. Fixing the random seed value: This ensures that the same sequence of random numbers is generated every time the model is run, making the results reproducible.
2. Using techniques like dropout and batch normalization: These techniques help reduce overfitting and improve the robustness of the model to random variations.
3. Ensemble methods: Averaging the predictions of multiple models trained with different random initializations can help reduce the impact of randomness.
4. Hyperparameter tuning: Carefully tuning hyperparameters can help reduce the sensitivity of the model to random variations.

It is essential to note that these strategies are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, and the answer is based on general knowledge of deep learning techniques.
