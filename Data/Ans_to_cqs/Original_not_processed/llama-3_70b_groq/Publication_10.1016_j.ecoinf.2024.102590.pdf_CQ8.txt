Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository for a deep learning pipeline. The text mentions deep learning CNN (Jagannathan and Divya, 2021) as a methodology that can be used for future LULC analysis, but it does not provide a link to a code repository. The references provided are mostly academic papers and books, and they do not seem to be related to a specific code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
