Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the classifier used (SVM), the kernels used (linear, Gaussian, and polynomial), and the equations for these kernels. It also explains the confusion matrix and its parameters, as well as the dataset and clustering algorithms. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters are optimized, such as through grid search, random search, or other methods.
