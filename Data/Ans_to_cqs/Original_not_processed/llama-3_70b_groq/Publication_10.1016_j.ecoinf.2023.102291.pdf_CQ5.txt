Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific datasets used in the deep learning pipeline, such as MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention that the smallest dataset comprised 3900 images, combining a two-second window size and 90 dpi for the transfer learning approach. This suggests that the dataset used is a custom dataset, possibly related to whale song detection or acoustic analysis, given the references to humpback whale song and hearing in whales and dolphins.
