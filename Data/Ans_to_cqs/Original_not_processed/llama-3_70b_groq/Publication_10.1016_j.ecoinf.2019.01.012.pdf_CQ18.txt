Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of a validation set. The validation set is used to fine-tune hyperparameters and select the best model setup during the training process. The model's performance is evaluated on the validation set, and the best model is chosen based on two parameters: accuracy and loss. The loss serves as a measure of how far the model predictions differ from the actual class. The model's accuracy and loss are calculated for both the training and validation sets. This approach allows for monitoring the model's performance during training and selecting the best model that generalizes well to unseen data.
