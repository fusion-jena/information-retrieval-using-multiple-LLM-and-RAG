Answer::: 

The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is classification, specifically species identification. The model is trained on a dataset of images to classify them into different species classes. The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that extracts features from the input images and outputs a classification score for each species class. The goal is to accurately identify the species in the images, and the model is trained and tuned to optimize its performance on this task.
