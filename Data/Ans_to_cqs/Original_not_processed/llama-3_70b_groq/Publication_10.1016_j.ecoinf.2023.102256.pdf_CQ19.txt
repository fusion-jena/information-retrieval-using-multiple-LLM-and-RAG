Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention which deep learning framework is used to build the model. However, it does reference a paper by Abadi et al. (2015) titled "TensorFlow: Large-scale machine learning on heterogeneous systems." This suggests that TensorFlow might be used, but it is not explicitly stated. Therefore, I cannot confirm which framework is used to build the deep learning model.
