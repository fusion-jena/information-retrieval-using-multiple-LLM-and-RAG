Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning for insect identification, monitoring, and counting, as well as the development of datasets and pipelines for these tasks. It does not delve into the technical details of the deep learning models or their regularization methods. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
