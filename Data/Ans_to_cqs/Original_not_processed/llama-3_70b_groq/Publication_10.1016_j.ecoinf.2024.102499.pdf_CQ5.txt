Answer:::
The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not traditional datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the authors created their own datasets using baited underwater videos. They transformed video clips into still images at a rate of 1 frame per second and annotated sharks and 19 non-shark species present in the frames with bounding boxes. This resulted in 26,947 fish annotations. The dataset includes 8 shark species and 19 non-shark species commonly associated with sharks. The authors also used the COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014) as pre-training data to prepare the first layers of their model.
