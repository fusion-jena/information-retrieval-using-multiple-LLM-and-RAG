Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model. However, it does mention the "rate of correct classification" and "confidence score" which suggests that accuracy might be one of the metrics used. Additionally, the context provides the mean rate of correct classification for humans and the best model, along with their standard deviations, which further supports the idea that accuracy is being used as a metric. 

However, it does not provide any information about precision, recall, or other metrics that are commonly used to evaluate the performance of deep learning models. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that precision and recall are used as metrics in this context.
