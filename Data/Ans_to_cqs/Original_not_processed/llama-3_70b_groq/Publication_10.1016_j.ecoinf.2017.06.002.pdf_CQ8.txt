Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It discusses the NGEE Tropics Archive, a data repository for the NGEE Tropics project, and FRAMES, a system designed to facilitate data submission to the archive. The context mentions Django, a Python web framework, and Foundation, a front-end framework, but it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or its code repository.
