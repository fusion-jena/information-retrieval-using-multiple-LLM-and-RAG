Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment platform used for the deep learning model. It only mentions the use of OpenAI's ChatGPT for spell checking, grammar checking, and debugging in code, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. Therefore, I cannot determine which platform was used to deploy the deep learning model.
