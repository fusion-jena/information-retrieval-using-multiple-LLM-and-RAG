Answer: TensorFlow

The context mentions that the models were coded in Python (version 3.8.12) using Scikit-learn 1.0.1 and TensorFlow 2.3.0. This indicates that TensorFlow is used to build the deep learning model, specifically the ANN (Artificial Neural Network) model. There is no mention of PyTorch or any other deep learning framework.
