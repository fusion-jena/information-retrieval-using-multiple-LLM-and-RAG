Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context focuses on the overall approach of using a semi-supervised pipeline for hyperspectral image classification, and discusses the potential benefits of using deep learning-based approaches for remote sensing data. It also provides some details on the study site and field data used, but does not provide information on the specific hyperparameters used in the model.
