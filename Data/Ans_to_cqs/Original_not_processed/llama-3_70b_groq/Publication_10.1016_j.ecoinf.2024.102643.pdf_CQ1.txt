Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to bioclimatic analysis, conservation, and species management, but it does not provide information on data collection methods for deep learning.

The context mentions various statistical and machine learning methods, such as Maximum Entropy, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and others, but it does not discuss how the data for these methods was collected. It also mentions surveys and experts in the context of human-bear conflict, but it does not provide information on data collection methods for deep learning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
