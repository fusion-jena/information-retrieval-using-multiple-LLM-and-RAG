Answer:::

The provided context does not mention the specific criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. The context only mentions that one fold was set aside for external evaluation, and the remaining four folds were used for internal cross-validation during model training. It does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation of deep learning models.

In fact, the context does not even mention deep learning models, as the models used are categorized into regression-based models (GLMs, GAMs, and MARS) and machine learning models (RF, ANN, and MaxEnt). Therefore, it is not possible to determine the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training based on the provided context.
