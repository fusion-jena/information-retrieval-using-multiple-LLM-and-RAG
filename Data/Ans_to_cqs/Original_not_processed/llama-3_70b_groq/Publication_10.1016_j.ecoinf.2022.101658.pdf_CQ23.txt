Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the authors employed data augmentation strategies to increase the size of the training set, which can help improve the generalizability of the deep learning model. Specifically, they used horizontal flip, Gaussian noise addition, and contrast reduction to augment the dataset. This can help the model learn to recognize patterns in the data that are invariant to these transformations, making it more robust and generalizable.

Additionally, the authors used data from three field sites: Pelican Mountain (PM), Calling Lake (CL), and Conklin (CK). While the data from PM and CL were used for training and testing the model, the data from CK were used solely for independent validation. This suggests that the authors attempted to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data, which can help assess its generalizability.

However, there is no mention of cross-validation or stratified splitting in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear whether these measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the model.
