Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that out-of-bag validation is used to evaluate the model's performance. This is mentioned in section 2.5.1, where it is stated that "The accuracy of the model was evaluated at the simulated locations using an out-of-bag validation." This suggests that the model's performance is monitored during training by predicting the values at the data points that were not selected for each bootstrap sample and averaging the results of these predicted values across all bootstrap samples.
