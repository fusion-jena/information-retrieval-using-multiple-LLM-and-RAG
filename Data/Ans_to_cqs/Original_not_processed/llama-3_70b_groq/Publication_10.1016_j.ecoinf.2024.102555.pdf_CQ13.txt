Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The first reference mentions the integration of swarm intelligence algorithms into deep learning neural networks for flood susceptibility mapping, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used. The other references are not related to deep learning models or hyperparameters. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
