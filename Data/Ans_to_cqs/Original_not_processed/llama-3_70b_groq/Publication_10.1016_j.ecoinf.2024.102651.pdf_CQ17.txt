Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the classification accuracy of the CA-Hybrid network and its comparison with other networks, as well as the effect of image size on classification performance. It does not provide information on regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
