Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the mentioned applications of RNNs and LSTMs, such as speech recognition, language models, and natural language processing, it can be inferred that audio and text data formats might be used.

Additionally, the context mentions land cover/land use classification, which often involves image data. Therefore, it is possible that image data formats are also used in the deep learning pipeline.

There is no mention of video data formats being used. CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a common format for tabular data, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the context.

In summary, while the context does not provide a direct answer, it can be inferred that audio, text, and image data formats might be used in the deep learning pipeline, but the use of CSV or video formats is not explicitly mentioned.
