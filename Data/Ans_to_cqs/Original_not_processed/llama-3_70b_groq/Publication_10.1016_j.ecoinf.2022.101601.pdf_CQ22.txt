The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any metrics used to evaluate its performance. The text appears to be discussing Bayesian Networks (BNs) and their application to permafrost thaw depth modeling, but it does not mention deep learning models or their evaluation metrics. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
