Answer::: 
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is explicitly stated in section 2.5, which describes the Convolutional Neural Network architecture used to classify spectrograms. The architecture consists of four convolutional layers with specific kernel sizes, filters, and pooling layers.
