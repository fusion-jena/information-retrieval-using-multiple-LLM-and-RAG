Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be a research paper discussing ecological source areas and ecological corridors in the WRB (Watershed Region Basin) using a genetic algorithm (GA). The context provides information on the study area, methodology, and results, but it does not mention a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
