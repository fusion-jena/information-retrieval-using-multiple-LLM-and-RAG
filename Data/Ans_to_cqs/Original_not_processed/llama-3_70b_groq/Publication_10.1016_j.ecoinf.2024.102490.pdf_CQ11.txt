Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a specific data repository link associated with it. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and mentions various databases such as SpeciesLink, Reflora-Virtual Herbarium, and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) system, but it does not provide information about a deep learning pipeline or a data repository link. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to the query.
