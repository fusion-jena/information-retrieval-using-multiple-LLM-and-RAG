Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention training or validation loss plateau, which are common criteria used in machine learning to determine when training is complete. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, soil science, and water resources, but it does not provide information on machine learning model training or evaluation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
