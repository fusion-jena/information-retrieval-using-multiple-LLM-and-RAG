Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text describes the model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics, but it does not provide information about hyperparameter tuning. It is possible that the author used a specific method for hyperparameter optimization, such as grid search or random search, but this information is not explicitly stated in the text. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
