Answer: 

The provided context does not mention deep learning or any optimization techniques commonly used in deep learning pipelines, such as SGD or Adam. The context appears to be discussing a different type of model, possibly a generalized linear model or a regression model, and mentions the use of a gradient ascent method for computing L1 penalized estimates. There is no mention of deep learning or neural networks. Therefore, it is not possible to determine what optimization techniques are applied in a deep learning pipeline based on the provided context.
