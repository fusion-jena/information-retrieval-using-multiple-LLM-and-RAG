Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. It mentions that the workflow is open-source and integrated with the DataMiner Cloud computing platform, but it does not provide information about a specific repository where the pipeline is stored. Additionally, it mentions that the data is available on a distributed ISO/OGC compliant Spatial Data Infrastructure, but it does not specify a particular repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
