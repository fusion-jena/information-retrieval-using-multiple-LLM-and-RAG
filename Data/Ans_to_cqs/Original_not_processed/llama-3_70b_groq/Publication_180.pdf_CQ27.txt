Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context focuses on the adaptation and configuration of TensorFlow for automated species identification, specifically for Triatominae species related to Chagas disease. It discusses the adjustment of parameters, such as validation percentage and number of training steps, and the calibration of models for Mexican and Brazilian species. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
