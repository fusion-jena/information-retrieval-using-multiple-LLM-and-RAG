Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model, IUC-NN. However, it does mention "Spatial cleaning" in the table, which suggests that some form of cleaning or preprocessing of the spatial data was performed. 

Beyond that, the context does not provide further information on preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or other types of cleaning. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact preprocessing steps involved in this specific case.
