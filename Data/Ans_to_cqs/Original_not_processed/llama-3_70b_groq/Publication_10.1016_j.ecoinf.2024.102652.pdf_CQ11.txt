Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It provides information about the training process, the optimizer used, the learning ratio, and the loss function, but it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. The context appears to be a section from a research paper, and it may not be common practice to include data repository links in the body of the paper. If the link is available, it might be provided in a separate section or in a supplementary materials document.
