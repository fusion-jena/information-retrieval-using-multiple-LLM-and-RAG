Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. It only mentions CPU (Central Processing Unit) and GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) in the list of abbreviations, but it does not specify which one was used for training the model. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
