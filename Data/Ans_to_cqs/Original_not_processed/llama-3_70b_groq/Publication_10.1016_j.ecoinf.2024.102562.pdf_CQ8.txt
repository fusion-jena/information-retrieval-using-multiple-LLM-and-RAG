Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of deep learning algorithms, specifically Mask-RCNN, for image analysis of soil bacterial communities, but it does not provide information about the code repository. The authors mention that there are efforts to make deep learning-based methods accessible to researchers without coding expertise, but they do not provide a specific link or reference to the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
