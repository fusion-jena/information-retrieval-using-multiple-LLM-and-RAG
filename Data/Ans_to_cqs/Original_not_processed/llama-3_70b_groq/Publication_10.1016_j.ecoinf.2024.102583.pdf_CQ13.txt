Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as learning rate, optimizer, etc. The context discusses the use of XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models for landslide susceptibility mapping, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used in these models. Additionally, the context mentions the plan to investigate the scalability and transferability of ensemble techniques and compare their performance with deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN), but it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in these models.
