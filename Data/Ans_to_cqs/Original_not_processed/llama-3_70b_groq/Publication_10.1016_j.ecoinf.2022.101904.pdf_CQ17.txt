Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, particularly transformers, for wetland mapping and the proposed 3D UNet Generative Adversarial Network Swin Transformer (3DUNetGSFormer) to adaptively synthesize wetland training data. It discusses the advantages of transformers over CNNs and the use of a conditional map unit in the 3D GAN network to produce synthetic samples from a random noise vector. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
