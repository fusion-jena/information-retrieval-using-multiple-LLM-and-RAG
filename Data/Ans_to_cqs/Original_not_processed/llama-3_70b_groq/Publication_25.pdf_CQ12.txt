Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The text only mentions a "self-supervised (red, green, blue (RGB) deep learning model" without specifying the architecture of the model. It does not provide enough information to determine whether it is a CNN, RNN, Transformer, or any other type of deep learning model.
