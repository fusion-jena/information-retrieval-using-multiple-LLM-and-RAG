Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the importance of training data resembling the application data, domain adaptation, and supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning methods. It also discusses semantic image segmentation, neural network architectures, and image datasets.

However, in general, the criteria for splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets are crucial in deep learning model development. Common practices include:

1. Random splitting: Randomly dividing the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets.
2. Stratified splitting: Splitting the data while maintaining the same class distribution in each set.
3. Hold-out method: Holding out a portion of the data as a test set and using the remaining data for training and validation.

These criteria are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. If you need more information on data splitting criteria, I can provide general information or point you to relevant resources.
