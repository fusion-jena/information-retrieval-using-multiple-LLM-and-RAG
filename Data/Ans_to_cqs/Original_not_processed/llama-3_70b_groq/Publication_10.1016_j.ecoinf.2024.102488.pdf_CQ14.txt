Answer: The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a grid-search strategy. This is mentioned in the text as "We used a grid-search strategy to determine the optimal parameters for the base and metamodels." This indicates that the model uses a grid search approach to find the optimal hyperparameters for the base models (KNN, RF, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM) and the metamodel (RF).
