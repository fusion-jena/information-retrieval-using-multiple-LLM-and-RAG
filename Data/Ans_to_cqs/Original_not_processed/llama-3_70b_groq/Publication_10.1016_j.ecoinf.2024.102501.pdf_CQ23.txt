Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context discusses the application of different machine learning and deep learning models to predict dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, but it does not provide information on the specific techniques used to ensure generalizability, such as diverse datasets, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
