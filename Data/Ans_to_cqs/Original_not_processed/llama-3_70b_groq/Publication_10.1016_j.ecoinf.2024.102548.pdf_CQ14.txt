Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only discusses the parameter settings used in the experiments, such as the use of pre-trained weights, batch size, number of epochs, and class mode. However, it does not provide information on how these hyperparameters were optimized or tuned.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context. It is possible that the hyperparameters were optimized using techniques such as grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization, but this information is not provided.
