Answer:::
Answer: Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is images. The context mentions camera traps and camera images, and the use of a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model, specifically the AlexNet model, which is commonly used for image classification tasks. Additionally, the context mentions the preprocessing of images and the use of a desktop personal computer (PC) to achieve automatic filtering of empty camera images. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
