Answer: 

The provided context does not mention deep learning or optimization techniques such as SGD or Adam. The context primarily discusses random forest (RF) and its applications in machine learning, specifically in the context of species distribution modeling. It mentions the use of RF for classification and regression tasks, handling large numbers of predictor variables, and measuring variable importance. However, it does not provide any information about deep learning or optimization techniques used in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
