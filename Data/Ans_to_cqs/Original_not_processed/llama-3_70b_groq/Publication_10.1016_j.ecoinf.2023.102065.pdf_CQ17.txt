Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in bioacoustic classification and soundscape analysis. It discusses various aspects of CNN architectures, such as the representation of sound data, the use of mel-spectrograms, and the importance of hyperparameter tuning. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods used to prevent overfitting.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
