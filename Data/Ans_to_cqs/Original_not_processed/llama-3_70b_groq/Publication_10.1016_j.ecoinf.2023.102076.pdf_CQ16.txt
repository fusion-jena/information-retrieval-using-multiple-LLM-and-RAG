Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The text only mentions that development sets were used to evaluate classification performance during experiments, and the testing sets were used to evaluate the final classifier for each classification task. It does not provide information on how the training process was stopped or what criteria were used to determine convergence.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
