Answer:::

The provided context mentions that data augmentation techniques are used to simulate the deformations that data could suffer in the real world. Specifically, it mentions the following techniques:

* Scaling
* Rotations
* Translations
* Different illumination conditions
* Cropping parts of the image

It does not explicitly mention flipping, but it is a common data augmentation technique used in deep learning pipelines. However, it is not mentioned in the provided context.

Note that the context does not provide an exhaustive list of data augmentation techniques, and there may be other techniques used in deep learning pipelines that are not mentioned here.
