Answer::: 

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline include:

* Rotation: random assignment of rotation in the range of 0-40 degrees
* Width and height shift: random assignment of width and height shift in the range of 20%
* Shear: random assignment of shear in the range of 0-0.2 radians
* Zoom: random assignment of zoom in the range of 0-0.2 scalar
* Horizontal flip: random assignment of horizontal flip
* Fill mode: filling with the nearest pixel

These techniques were applied using the Keras image_data_generator function.
