Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the parameter selection was performed by minimizing the mean squared error. This suggests that the model performance was evaluated based on the mean squared error metric, but the exact strategy or approach used to monitor the model performance during training is not specified.

It is also worth noting that the context mentions the lack of temporal data for model performance evaluation, which implies that there might be limitations in evaluating the model's performance over time. However, this does not provide direct information about the strategy used to monitor the model performance during training.
