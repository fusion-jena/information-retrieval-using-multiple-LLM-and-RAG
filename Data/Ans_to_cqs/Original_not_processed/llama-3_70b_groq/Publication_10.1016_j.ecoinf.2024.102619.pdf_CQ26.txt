Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that the images in each dataset were split into 80% training (including 5-fold cross-validation) and 20% testing subsets, and that the splits were stratified to preserve the class-ratio. This implies that stratified splitting was used to address class imbalance issues.

Additionally, the context mentions that class imbalance can be handled by down-weighting common classes or up-sampling rare classes, citing Durden et al. (2021) and Langenk√§mper et al. (2019b). This suggests that oversampling and undersampling are potential techniques that can be used to address data bias, although they are not explicitly mentioned as being used in this specific pipeline.

There is no mention of diverse data collection as a technique used to address data bias in this context.
