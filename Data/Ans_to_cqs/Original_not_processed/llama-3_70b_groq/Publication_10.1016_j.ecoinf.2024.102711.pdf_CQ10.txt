Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository link of the deep learning pipeline, such as a link to GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The context only provides information about AutoGluon, an open-source AutoML library, its features, and its application in a study. It does not provide any information about a specific code repository or pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a code repository.
