Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a code repository or provide any information about where the code for the deep learning pipeline is available. The context appears to be related to a research paper or article discussing the use of machine learning models for habitat prediction, but it does not include any information about the code or its availability. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query.
