Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the differences between XGBoost and deep learning models, their architectures, and their performance on small datasets. It does not provide information on data preprocessing techniques or methods to address data bias.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
