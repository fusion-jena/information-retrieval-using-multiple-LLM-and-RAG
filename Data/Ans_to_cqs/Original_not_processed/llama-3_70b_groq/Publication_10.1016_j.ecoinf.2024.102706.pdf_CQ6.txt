Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on machine learning models, such as linear regression, Enet, SVM, RF, XGboost, and LightGBM, and their hyperparameters, performance metrics, and variable importance. It does not provide information on preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning, which are typically essential steps in preparing data for deep learning models.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
