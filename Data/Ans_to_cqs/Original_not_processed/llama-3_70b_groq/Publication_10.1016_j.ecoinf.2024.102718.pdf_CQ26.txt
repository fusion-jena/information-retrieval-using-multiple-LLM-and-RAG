Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention that class weights (wc) are computed to address class imbalance, which is a type of data bias. This suggests that the authors are aware of the issue of class imbalance and have taken steps to mitigate it, but the specific technique used is not mentioned.

Additionally, the context mentions data augmentation techniques such as modifications in brightness, contrast, saturation, and hue, along with random horizontal and vertical flips, and random rotations up to thirty degrees, as well as the incorporation of Gaussian noise. These techniques can help increase the diversity of the dataset and make the model more robust, but they are not specifically designed to address data bias.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine which specific techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline.
