Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model being used in a pipeline. The context mentions various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, Penalized Regression, Support Vector Machine, Gradient Boosting, Artificial Neural Network, and k-Nearest Neighbors, but it does not specify a deep learning model like CNN, RNN, or Transformer. The context also mentions hyperparameters tuned for each algorithm, but it does not provide information about a deep learning model being used in a pipeline.
