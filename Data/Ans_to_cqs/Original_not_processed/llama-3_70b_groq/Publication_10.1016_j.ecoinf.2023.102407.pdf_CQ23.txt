Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context discusses Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and mentions various modeling packages such as MaxEnt, GLM, GAM, RF, GBM, XGB, LGBM, and ANN, but it does not provide information on the specific measures taken to ensure generalizability.

The context does mention the problem of data shortage and overfitting, which can affect the generalizability of models, but it does not provide information on how this issue was addressed in the study. It suggests that spatial extrapolation and the integration of multiple observational datasets can be used to solve the data shortage problem, but it does not provide details on how these methods were used in the study.

Therefore, without more information, it is not possible to determine what measures were taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
