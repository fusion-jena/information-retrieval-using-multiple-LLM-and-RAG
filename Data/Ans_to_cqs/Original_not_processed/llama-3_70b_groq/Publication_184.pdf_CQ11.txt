Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the training of a YOLO model for fish detection, provides hyper-parameters used for training, and references several research papers on deep learning and image processing. However, it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
