Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses various semi-supervised learning techniques, active learning, and a recommender system, but it does not provide a link to a code repository such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. The context appears to be a research paper or article, and it may not be common practice to include code repository links in such publications.
