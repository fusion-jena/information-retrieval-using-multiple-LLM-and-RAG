Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or any specific type of model (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) in the pipeline. The text discusses the analysis of forest fires, the use of data layers such as FWI and FFMC, and the implementation of a Web-GIS prototype, but it does not provide information about the specific machine learning or deep learning models used. Therefore, I cannot determine the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
