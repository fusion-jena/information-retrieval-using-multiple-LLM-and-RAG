Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the methodology for training deep noise reduction techniques, data requirements, and ablation studies.

However, Fig. 1 in the context provides a diagram of the methodology pipeline, which includes validation data set, noise reduction and deep audio enhancement models, and denoised outputs. It can be inferred that some form of evaluation or comparison is being done between the denoised outputs, but the specific postprocessing steps are not mentioned.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training.
