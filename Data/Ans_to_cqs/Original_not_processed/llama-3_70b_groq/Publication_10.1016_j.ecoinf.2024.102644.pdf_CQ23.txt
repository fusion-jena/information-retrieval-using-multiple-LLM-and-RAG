Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of a deep learning model. The context primarily discusses the availability and characteristics of large-scale repositories of FAIR biodiversity data, such as GBIF and OBIS, and their potential use in ecological and ecosystem models. It also mentions the importance of using these data cautiously due to potential sampling biases.

There is no mention of a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability, such as using a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
