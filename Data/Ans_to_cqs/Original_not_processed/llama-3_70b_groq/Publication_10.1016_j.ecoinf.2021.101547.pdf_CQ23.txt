Answer: 

The context does not explicitly mention measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as cross-validation or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the model was trained on a diverse set of background images from aerial survey imagery, which suggests an attempt to increase the model's generalizability. 

Specifically, the model was trained on 6092 randomly selected photos (~10% of the full set), excluding the 20 photos known to contain bears. This random selection of images may help to increase the diversity of the training dataset and reduce overfitting. Additionally, the model was validated on a separate set of 1000 randomly selected and cropped background images, which may provide some insight into the model's performance on unseen data. 

However, without further information, it is unclear whether other measures such as cross-validation or stratified splitting were used to ensure the model's generalizability.
