Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention optimization techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context appears to be related to landscape planning and design, with discussions on 3D landscape indexes, visual landscape elements, and restorative potential mapping. While there are mentions of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and image-based methods, there is no information about the specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline.
