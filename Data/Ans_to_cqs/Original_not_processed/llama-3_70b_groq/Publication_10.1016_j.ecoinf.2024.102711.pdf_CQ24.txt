Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly discuss strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on automated machine learning (AutoML), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and traditional machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost.

However, it is common practice in machine learning to handle randomness by setting a fixed random seed value to ensure reproducibility of results. This is particularly important when working with models that involve random initialization, such as neural networks.

In the context of Random Forest, the bootstrap aggregating (bagging) technique is used to generate multiple decision tree models by randomly selecting subsets from the training dataset. This process inherently involves randomness, but the context does not provide specific strategies for handling it.

In summary, the provided context does not provide explicit strategies for handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, setting a fixed random seed value is a common practice in machine learning to ensure reproducibility of results.
