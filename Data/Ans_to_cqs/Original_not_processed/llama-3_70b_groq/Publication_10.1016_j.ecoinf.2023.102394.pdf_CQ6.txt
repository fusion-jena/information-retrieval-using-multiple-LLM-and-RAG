Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques in soil organic carbon stock prediction and ecological informatics, citing various studies and references. It discusses the use of deep learning algorithms, such as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), but does not delve into the preprocessing steps.

However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to perform preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning before training a model. These steps help to prepare the data, reduce dimensionality, and improve the model's performance. Normalization and scaling can help to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model, while cleaning can remove noisy or missing data.

In the absence of explicit information, it is reasonable to assume that some form of preprocessing was likely performed before training the deep learning model, but the specific steps are not mentioned in the provided context.
