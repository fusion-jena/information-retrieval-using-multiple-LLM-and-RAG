Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context discusses various topics such as water pollution control, greenhouse gas emissions, and wastewater treatment, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context only mentions the architecture and parameters of the neural network model, but it does not specify the hardware used to train the model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
