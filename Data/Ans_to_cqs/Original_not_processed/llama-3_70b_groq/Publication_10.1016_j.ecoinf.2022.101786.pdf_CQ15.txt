Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The text focuses on the configuration of the model, the training process, and the evaluation of the model's performance, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used to update the model's parameters during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
