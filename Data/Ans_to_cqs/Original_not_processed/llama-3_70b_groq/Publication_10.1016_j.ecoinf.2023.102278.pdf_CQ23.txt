Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context focuses on the performance of the models, the use of transfer learning, and multitask learning, but it does not provide information on dataset diversity, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
