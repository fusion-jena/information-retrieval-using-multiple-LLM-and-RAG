Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the deep learning models used in the pipeline are primarily Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, the models mentioned include:

1. UNet: A CNN architecture originally proposed for biomedical image segmentation, based on an encoder-decoder-type network.
2. VGG16: A CNN model used in the Model-K architecture, without the feature extractor on top.
3. EfficientNet: A CNN developed by Google, characterized by high accuracy and computational efficiency, used as the feature extractor in the Model-2 architecture.
4. ResNeXt: A CNN model used in combination with CCNN in [11].
5. Count-ception: A CNN model that uses Inception modules to build a network for counting objects in an image.

There is no mention of RNNs or Transformers in the provided context.
