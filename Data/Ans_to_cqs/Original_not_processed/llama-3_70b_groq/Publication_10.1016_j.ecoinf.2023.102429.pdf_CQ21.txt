Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the post-processing steps involved after model training. The context primarily focuses on the pre-processing steps, model training using SVM and PLSR, and the calculation of performance metrics such as RMSE, R2, RPD, and RPIQ. 

However, it can be inferred that metrics calculation is one of the post-processing steps involved, as the context provides the formulas for calculating these metrics. But, there is no mention of saliency maps or confusion matrix as post-processing steps. 

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the context does not provide information about the post-processing steps involved after model training, except for metrics calculation.
