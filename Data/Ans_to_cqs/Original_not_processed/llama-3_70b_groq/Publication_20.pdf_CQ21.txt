Answer:::

The post-processing steps involved after the model training, as mentioned in the provided context, are the application of two a posteriori decision rules: r1 and r2.

Decision rule r1 is applied when the network's first proposition is 'environment' with a confidence lower than 99%. In such cases, the final output is the fish class with the highest probability.

Decision rule r2 is applied when the result given by the network is "part of species X". In such cases, the final output is "species X".

These decision rules are applied to correct the raw outputs of the model and improve its performance. There is no mention of other post-processing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix in the provided context.
