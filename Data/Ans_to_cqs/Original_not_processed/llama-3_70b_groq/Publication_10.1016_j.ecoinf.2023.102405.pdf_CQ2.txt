Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the deep learning pipeline uses CSV (Comma Separated Values) data format. The text mentions "real-time data from IoT devices, including temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nitrate concentration" which suggests that the data is collected in a numerical format, likely in a CSV file. Additionally, the study proposes a comprehensive framework that integrates IoT-based real-time data collection and segregation, which further supports the use of CSV format. There is no mention of image, audio, or video data formats in the context, which suggests that they are not used in the deep learning pipeline.
