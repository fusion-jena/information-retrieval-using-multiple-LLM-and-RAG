Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the use of pre-trained models, data augmentation, and training parameters, but it does not provide information on how the raw data was collected. 

It is mentioned that the Mask R-CNN model is pre-trained on the COCO 2017 train dataset, and the ResNets are pre-trained on the Kinetics-400 dataset. Additionally, an annotated dataset called AnnotationsActions is used for training and testing, but the context does not provide information on how this dataset was collected.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
