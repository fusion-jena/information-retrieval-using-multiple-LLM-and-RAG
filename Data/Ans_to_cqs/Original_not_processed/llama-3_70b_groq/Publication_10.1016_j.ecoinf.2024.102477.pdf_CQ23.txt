Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the formulation of the SVR model, its parameters, and the comparison of its performance with other models. It also discusses the SGRU-based deep learning approach for predicting atmospheric CO concentrations, but it does not provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.

However, it is common practice in machine learning and deep learning to use techniques such as cross-validation, stratified splitting, and diverse datasets to ensure the generalizability of models. These techniques help to prevent overfitting, improve model robustness, and increase the confidence in the model's performance on unseen data. But without explicit information, it cannot be confirmed whether these measures were taken in this specific study.
