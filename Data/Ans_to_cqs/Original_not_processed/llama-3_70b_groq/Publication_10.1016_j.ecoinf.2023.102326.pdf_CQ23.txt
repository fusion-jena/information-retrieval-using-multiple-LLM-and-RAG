Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context discusses the analysis of urban acoustic environments, sound event classification using machine learning approaches, and complex network measures, but it does not provide information about a specific deep learning model or its evaluation. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
