Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The text discusses the use of machine learning models such as random forest (RF), Multilayer perceptron (MLP), long-short term memory (LSTM), and support vector regression (SVR) for predicting algal-related parameters, but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training these models. Therefore, I cannot determine whether GPUs, TPUs, or other hardware resources were used for training the model.
