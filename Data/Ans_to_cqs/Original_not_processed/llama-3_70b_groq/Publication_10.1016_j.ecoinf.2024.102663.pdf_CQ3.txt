Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the importance of fish biomass estimation, the challenges of manual methods, and the potential of deep learning-based methods for estimating fish biomass in turbid environments. It also mentions the use of object detection and segmentation techniques to extract fish from the background and calculate their size and biomass. However, it does not specify the data annotation techniques used, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
