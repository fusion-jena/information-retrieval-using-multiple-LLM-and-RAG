Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Residual Neural Network (ResNet). Specifically, the ResNet50V2 model is used for fish classification by species. This is mentioned in section 2.3 of the text, which states that "the chosen architecture is a residual neural network, whose main characteristic is that it can skip some of its layers (He et al., 2016)". Additionally, it is mentioned that the ResNet50V2 model is implemented in TensorFlow and pre-trained with the ImageNet dataset.
