Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) or Adam. The context primarily focuses on explaining the loss functions and metrics used in the object detection model, specifically YOLO (You Only Look Once). It discusses the classification loss, box loss, and other metrics like mAP50, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques employed during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the given context.
