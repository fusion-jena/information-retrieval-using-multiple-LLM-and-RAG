Answer:::

The provided context mentions some of the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model. Specifically, it mentions:

* Learning rate: The initial learning rate is set to 10^(-2) for all layers, and it is decreased by a factor of 10 every 69 iterations.
* Batch size: The batch size is set to 69.
* Momentum: The momentum is set to 0.9.
* L2 weight decay: The penalty multiplier is set to 5 Ã— 10^(-4).
* Dropout ratio: The dropout ratio is set to 0.5.
* Optimizer: Although the optimizer is not explicitly mentioned, it is implied to be stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with the "step" learning rate policy, as it is mentioned that the model was trained using stochastic gradient descent and the backpropagation algorithm included in Caffe.

Note that some hyperparameters, such as the number of epochs, may not be mentioned in the provided context.
