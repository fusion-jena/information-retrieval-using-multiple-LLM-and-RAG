Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the development and evaluation of machine learning models, including Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question.
