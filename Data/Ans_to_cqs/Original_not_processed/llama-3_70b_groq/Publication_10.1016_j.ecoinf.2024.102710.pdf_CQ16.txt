Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It discusses the active learning strategies and experiments, but it does not provide information about the stopping criteria for training. It is possible that the authors used a certain number of epochs, a specific validation loss threshold, or another criterion, but this information is not provided in the given context. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
