Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is classification. 

The context mentions that the implementation of the classification methods was carried out in Python using the libraries TensorFlow and Scikit-learn. It also mentions that the accuracy, true positive rate, and false positive rate were obtained using the training-test splits of the time series. This suggests that the deep learning model, specifically the Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) methods, were used for classification tasks. Additionally, the comparison with other machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and the PBP method further supports the idea that the purpose of the deep learning model is classification.
