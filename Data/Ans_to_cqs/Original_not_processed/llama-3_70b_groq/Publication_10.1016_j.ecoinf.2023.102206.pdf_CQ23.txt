Answer: 

The context mentions that well-known benchmark datasets are utilized for evaluating the performance of machine learning algorithms. These datasets are partitioned into test data (target domain) and training data (source domain) using techniques such as KFold or StratifiedKFold. However, it is emphasized that for transfer learning, the source domain and target domain must be highly diverse but related, meaning that the distributions of the source and target domains (Ds and Dt) or the tasks of the source and target domains (Ts and Tt) should not be equal.

This implies that the generalizability of the deep learning model is ensured by using diverse datasets for the source and target domains, which is a common practice in transfer learning. Additionally, the use of techniques like KFold or StratifiedKFold for partitioning the datasets can be seen as a form of cross-validation, which helps to prevent overfitting and improves the model's generalizability.

However, it is not explicitly mentioned whether other measures such as data augmentation or ensemble methods were used to further improve the model's generalizability.
