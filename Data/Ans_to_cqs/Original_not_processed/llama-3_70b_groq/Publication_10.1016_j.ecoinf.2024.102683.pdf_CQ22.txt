Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and F1-score. These metrics are calculated based on the following equations: 

Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
Recall = TP / (TP + FN)
Specificity and F1-score are also calculated, but their equations are not provided in the given context.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model and compare it with other state-of-the-art models, including Inception-v3, VGG-11, VGG-19, Alex Net, GoogleNet, and Squeeze Net models.
