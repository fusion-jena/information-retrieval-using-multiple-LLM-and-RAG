Answer::: 

According to the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is a random division of the ground-truth dataset into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) sets. This is mentioned in Section 2.3.1 of the text, where it is stated that "The ground-truth dataset was divided randomly into training (80%), validation (10%), and test (10%) sets (Fig. 1)". This division allows for a good-sized validation and test dataset for evaluating the model's accuracy, while maximizing the training set.
