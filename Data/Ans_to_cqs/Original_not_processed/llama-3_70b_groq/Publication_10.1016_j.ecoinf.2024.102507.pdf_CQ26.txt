Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the technique used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline is data augmentation. Specifically, the research team used image rotation or overlapping plots to standardize the number of samples of each forest type to the same, thereby addressing the imbalance in the training data. This is mentioned in the context as "(c) data augmentation (using image rotation or overlapping plots, the number of samples of the forest type was standardized to the same)".

There is no mention of stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling in the provided context. Additionally, diverse data collection is not explicitly mentioned as a technique used to address data bias. Therefore, it can be concluded that data augmentation was the technique used to address data bias in this specific study.
