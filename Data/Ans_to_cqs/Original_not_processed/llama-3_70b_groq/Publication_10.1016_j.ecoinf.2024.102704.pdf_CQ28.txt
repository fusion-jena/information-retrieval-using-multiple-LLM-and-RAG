Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It mentions various models such as YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8, and also mentions TensorRT deployment, but it does not specify the cloud platform used for deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
