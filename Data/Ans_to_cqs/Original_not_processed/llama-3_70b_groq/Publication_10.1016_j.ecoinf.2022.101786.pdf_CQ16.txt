Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It mentions that the training process involves cycles of training on the training set, evaluating performance on the validation set, and adjusting CNN node weights, but it does not specify when to stop the training process.

However, it does mention that there is an optimum number of iterations before the performance on the validation and training sets starts to diverge, indicating overfitting. This suggests that the training process might be stopped when the performance on the validation set starts to degrade or plateaus, but this is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, I don't know the exact criteria used to determine when training is complete, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
