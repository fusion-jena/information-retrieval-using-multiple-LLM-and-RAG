Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline. The text discusses the use of machine learning models for automating or accelerating the process of labelling photos from remote cameras, and evaluates the effects of ML model performance on tagging efficiency. It mentions various methods for predicting whether an image is empty, including convolutional neural networks and ensemble learning, but does not provide information on regularization techniques used to prevent overfitting.
