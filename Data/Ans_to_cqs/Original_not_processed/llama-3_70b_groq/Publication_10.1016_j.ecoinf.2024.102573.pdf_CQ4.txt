Answer:::
The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are:

1. Changing audio speed
2. Pitch shift
3. Amplitude scaling (also known as gain modulation)
4. Adding Gaussian noise

These techniques are applied to the audio waveform. The context also mentions that time-frequency augmentation techniques could be beneficial, but they were not applied in this particular work. Additionally, it is suggested that applying data augmentation techniques to the backend's input, such as adding Gaussian noise, could be more effective.
