Answer: 

According to the provided context, the data is split into two subsets: training and validation. The splitting strategy is not the typical per-image approach, where each image is divided into training and validation sets. Instead, each image is vertically divided into halves, with one portion assigned to the training subset and the other to the validation set. This approach is used to mitigate potentially unbalanced sets arising from the varying insect numbers present in different images. There is no mention of a test set in the provided context.
