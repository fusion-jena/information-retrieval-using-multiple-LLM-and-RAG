Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific deep learning frameworks used to build a deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be focused on land use and land cover (LULC) mapping, remote sensing, and machine learning techniques, including random forests, but it does not provide information about the specific frameworks used for building deep learning models.
