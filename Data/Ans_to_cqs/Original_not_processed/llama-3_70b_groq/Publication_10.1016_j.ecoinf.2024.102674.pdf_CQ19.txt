Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific frameworks used to build the deep learning model. The context mentions various R packages such as RANDOMFOREST, GBM, and NEURALNETTOOLS, which are used for random forests, generalized boosted models, and neural networks, respectively. However, it does not provide information about the frameworks used for building the deep learning model, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch, which are typically used in Python-based deep learning implementations.
