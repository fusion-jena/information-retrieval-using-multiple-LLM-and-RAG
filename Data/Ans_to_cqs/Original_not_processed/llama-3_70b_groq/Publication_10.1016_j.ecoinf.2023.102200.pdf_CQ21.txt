Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. The context appears to be related to a study on individual tree segmentation using LiDAR data and an improved KNN algorithm, but it does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training.

The context includes tables and figures related to the study, such as parameter names and ranges for the LiDAR scanner, segmentation results, and field-measured mangrove tree data. However, it does not mention saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrices, which are common postprocessing steps in machine learning.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
