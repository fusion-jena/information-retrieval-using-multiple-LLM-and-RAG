Answer: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is the use of a confusion matrix. The confusion matrix provides essential parameters to validate the performance of a machine learning model, including True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), False Negative (FN), Sensitivity (TPR), Specificity (Sy), Accuracy, F1-score, and Cohen's Kappa (Îº). These parameters help to evaluate the model's performance and identify areas for improvement during training.
