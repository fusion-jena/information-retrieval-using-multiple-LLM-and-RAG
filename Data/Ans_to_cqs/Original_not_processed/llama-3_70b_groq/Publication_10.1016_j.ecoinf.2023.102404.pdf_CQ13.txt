Answer:::
The provided context does not mention a deep learning model, but rather a Random Forest (RF) regression algorithm. Therefore, it does not provide information about hyperparameters typically used in deep learning models, such as learning rate or optimizer.

However, the context does mention the hyperparameters used in the RF model, which are:

* numberOfTrees: 150
* minLeafPopulation: 3
* bagFraction: 1
* seed: 123

These hyperparameters are specific to the RF algorithm and are used to control the complexity and performance of the model.
