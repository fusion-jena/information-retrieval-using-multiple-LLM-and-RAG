Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training a deep learning model or the hardware resources used for it. The context appears to be related to permafrost, soil, and environmental variables, with references to scientific papers and variables such as soil temperature, vegetation height, and snow depth. There is no mention of deep learning models or hardware resources like GPUs or TPUs. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
