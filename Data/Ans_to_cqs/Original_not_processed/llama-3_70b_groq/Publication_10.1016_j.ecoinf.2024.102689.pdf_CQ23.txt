Answer: 

According to the provided context, one of the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model is cross-validation. Specifically, the dataset was partitioned into ten equal sections, known as folds, for conducting rigorous folded cross-validation. This methodology involves a cyclical process of training and testing, where one fold serves as the test set while the remaining nine folds are used for training. The trained model is then evaluated on the test set, and the resulting performance metrics are recorded. By averaging these outcomes, a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance is obtained. This approach helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to a specific subset of the data and can generalize well to new, unseen data. However, there is no mention of using a diverse dataset or stratified splitting in the provided context.
