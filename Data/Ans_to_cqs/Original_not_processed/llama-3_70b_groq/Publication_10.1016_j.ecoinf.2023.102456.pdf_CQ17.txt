Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be focused on forest fires, machine learning, and cellular automata, with no direct mention of regularization techniques.

While the context does discuss machine learning and neural networks, it does not provide information on regularization methods. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
