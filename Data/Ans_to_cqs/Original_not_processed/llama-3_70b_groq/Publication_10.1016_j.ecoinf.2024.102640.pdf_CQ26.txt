Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that data augmentation techniques are used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline in GreenCam. Specifically, the context mentions that "data augmentation techniques, including random rotations, scaling, and flipping of images" are implemented to improve the balance of the dataset and address underrepresented classes. This suggests that the approach taken is to artificially increase the size of the dataset by applying transformations to the existing images, rather than using techniques like stratified splitting, oversampling, or undersampling. Additionally, the context also mentions that the dataset is constructed by expanding the geographic scope of data collection to include a wider range of urban settings, which can be seen as a form of diverse data collection.
