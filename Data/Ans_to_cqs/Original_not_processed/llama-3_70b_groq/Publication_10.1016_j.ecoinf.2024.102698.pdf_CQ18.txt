Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context discusses the use of surrogate models, machine learning, and neural network-based models, but it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training. It only mentions the evaluation of the models using metrics such as Ï‡2 test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, correlations scores, mean data quality score, and mean data diagnostics scores, but it does not provide information on the training process. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
