Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on map evaluation, machine learning, and geostatistics, with no direct reference to deep learning model training or preprocessing steps.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention dividing a dataset into three parts: a training set, a validation set, and a test set, which is a common practice in machine learning. It also mentions the use of weights in cross-validation, but this is not directly related to preprocessing steps for deep learning models.

In general, common preprocessing steps for deep learning models may include normalization, scaling, cleaning, feature engineering, and data augmentation, but these are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.
