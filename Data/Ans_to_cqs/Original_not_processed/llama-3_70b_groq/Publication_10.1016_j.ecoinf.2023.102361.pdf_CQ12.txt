Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning models used in the pipeline are Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This is evident from the list of models mentioned in the context, which includes VGG16, VGG19, ResNet-50, Inception-V3, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201, and MobileNetV2. All of these models are variants of CNNs, which are commonly used for image classification tasks. There is no mention of RNNs or Transformers in the context.
