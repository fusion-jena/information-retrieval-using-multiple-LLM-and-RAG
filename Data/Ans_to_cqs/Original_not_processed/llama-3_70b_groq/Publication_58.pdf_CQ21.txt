Answer:::

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are:

1. Mapping: The trained models are run on the test set to obtain a complete mapping of Land Cover (LC) and Land Use (LU) classes.

2. Confusion Matrix: Confusion matrices are extracted from the mapping results. The confusion matrix is used to calculate quality metrics.

3. Metrics Calculation: Four quality metrics are calculated from the confusion matrix: Overall Accuracy (OA), Producer Accuracy (PA), User Accuracy (UA), and the F1-score. These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the models.

No mention is made of Saliency maps as a postprocessing step in the provided context. However, it is mentioned in the references that a filter-based post-processing technique can be used to improve the homogeneity of pixel-wise classification data.

Note that the shadow and cloud areas were not taken into account in the confusion matrix.
