Answer: Google Cloud platform

The context mentions Google Earth Engine (GEE) as a cloud-based platform used for processing big geospatial data. Although it does not explicitly state that a deep learning model was deployed on GEE, it implies that GEE provides a high-performance computation service and an associated web-based interactive development environment (IDE) that enables rapid prototyping and visualization of results. This suggests that GEE can be used to deploy and run machine learning models, including deep learning models. Therefore, based on the context, it can be inferred that the platform used to deploy the deep learning model is likely Google Cloud platform, which is associated with GEE.
