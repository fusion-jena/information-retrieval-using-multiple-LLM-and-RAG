Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on various machine learning models, such as LSTM, CNN, ConvLSTM, and GP, and their applications in streamflow forecasting, signal classification, and civil engineering problems. It also discusses the importance of considering ecological factors and model performance. However, it does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps like normalization, scaling, or cleaning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
