Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on landslide susceptibility mapping using machine learning models, including XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and heterogeneous ensemble techniques. It discusses the advantages of these models and their applications in landslide risk assessment.

However, it is a common practice in machine learning and deep learning to perform preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning before training a model. These steps help to improve the quality of the data, reduce the effect of outliers, and prepare the data for training.

Normalization involves scaling the numerical values in the dataset to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model. Scaling involves transforming the data to a specific range, such as standardization or min-max scaling. Cleaning involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors in the dataset.

While the context does not provide specific information on preprocessing steps, it is essential to perform these steps before training a deep learning model to ensure better performance and accuracy.
