Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the overall architecture of the DialectDecoder pipeline, the structure of the metadata file, and the classification process. It does not provide information on how the data was annotated.

However, it can be inferred that the data annotation involves labeling the bird songs with their corresponding dialect types, as the metadata file contains the classification information for training the CNN and k-NN. The context also mentions that the user can label the song in four ways, including choosing one of the machine learning algorithms' predictions, using a different pre-existing label, or assigning a new label. This suggests that the data annotation involves assigning labels or classification information to the bird songs, but the specific techniques used (e.g., bounding box annotation, instance segmentation) are not mentioned.
