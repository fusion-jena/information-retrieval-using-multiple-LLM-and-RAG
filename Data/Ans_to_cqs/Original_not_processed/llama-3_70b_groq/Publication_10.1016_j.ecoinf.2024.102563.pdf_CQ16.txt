Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be related to a study on land cover classification using different machine learning algorithms and feature extraction methods, but it does not provide information on the training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
