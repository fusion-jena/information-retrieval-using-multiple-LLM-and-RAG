Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context only describes the architecture of the model, including the number of layers, activation functions, and pooling strategy, but does not provide information about the hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
