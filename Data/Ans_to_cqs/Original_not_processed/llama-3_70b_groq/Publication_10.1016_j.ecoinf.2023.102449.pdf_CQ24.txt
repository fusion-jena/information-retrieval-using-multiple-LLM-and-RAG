Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of a deep learning model for ecoacoustic representation learning, including the encoder, decoder, and various blocks and layers. It does not discuss randomness or strategies for handling it. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
