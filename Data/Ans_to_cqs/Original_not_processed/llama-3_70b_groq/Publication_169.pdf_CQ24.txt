Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. However, it does mention a "random search" being performed over fourth- and fifth-layer models of the leaf features positions, which suggests that some form of randomness is introduced in the model selection process. 

Beyond this, there is no mention of how randomness is handled or controlled in the deep learning pipeline. It is possible that the authors may have used techniques such as setting a random seed value, using dropout layers, or applying regularization techniques to mitigate the effects of randomness, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided context.
