Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a research article on using machine learning models, including neural networks and Gaussian processes, for lake total suspended matter retrieval by wind speed. It provides references to various research papers and books, but does not mention a specific data repository link. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query.
