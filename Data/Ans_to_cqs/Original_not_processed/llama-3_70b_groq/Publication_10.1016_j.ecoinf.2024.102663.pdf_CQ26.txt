Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on image preprocessing techniques such as white balance, gamma correction, and sharpening, dehazing, denoising, and CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) to improve the quality of images for object detection using YOLOv8. 

It does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
