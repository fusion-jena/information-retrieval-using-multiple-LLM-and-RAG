Answer::: 

According to the provided context, the method utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline is through the use of underwater drones. Specifically, an image is taken with the help of an underwater drone, which is then segmentized and divided into small patches for feature extraction. This suggests that the raw data is collected through underwater drone-based image capture. There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for data collection in this specific context.
