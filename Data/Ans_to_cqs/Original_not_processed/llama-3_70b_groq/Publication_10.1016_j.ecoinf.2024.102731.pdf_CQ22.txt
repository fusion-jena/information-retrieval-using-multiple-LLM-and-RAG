Answer:::
The provided context does not mention the evaluation metrics of a deep learning model. The context appears to be related to landscape ecology and spatial analysis, discussing metrics such as patch density, core area index, contiguity index, and Euclidean nearest-neighbor distance. It also mentions statistical tests like the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope, which are used to analyze trends and patterns in data. There is no mention of deep learning models or their evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, or recall. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
