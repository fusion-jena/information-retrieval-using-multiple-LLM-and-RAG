Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. It discusses the hyperparameter tuning for the Random Forest (RF) model, the feature analysis, and the configuration of the prediction algorithm for gap filling. However, it does not provide information about the postprocessing steps such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
