Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. It does mention the use of a hold-out split for validation and test sets, which suggests that validation loss might be monitored during training. However, it does not specify when training is considered complete, such as when the validation loss reaches a plateau or a certain threshold. 

The context does mention the use of a cosine annealing schedule for the learning rate, which is a common technique used to adjust the learning rate during training. This might be related to determining when training is complete, but it is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, based on the provided context, I don't know the specific criteria used to determine when training is complete.
