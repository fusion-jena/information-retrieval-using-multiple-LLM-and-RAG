Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a deep learning model or any cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context appears to be related to a research paper or study on forest fires, discussing topics such as fire weather index, vegetation, and human impact. There is no mention of deep learning models or cloud platforms, so it is not possible to determine which platform was used to deploy a deep learning model.
