Answer::: 

The hyperparameters of the model are optimized through a grid search approach involving cross-validation, specifically focusing on minimizing the errors to achieve the best possible performance. This is achieved using Grid Search Cross-Validation (GSCV), a method utilized for fine-tuning the hyperparameters in a model. During training, GSCV generates a series of models, each characterized by a different set of hyperparameters. The purpose of this technique is to systematically train and assess the performance of these various models through cross-validation. The process concludes with the selection of the model that demonstrates the most superior performance, determined by its optimal hyperparameter combination.
