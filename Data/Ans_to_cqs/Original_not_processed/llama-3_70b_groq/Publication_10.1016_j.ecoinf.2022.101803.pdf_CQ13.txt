Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or its hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses parameter estimation with maximum likelihood, regularization, and ensemble methods like bagging and boosting, specifically XGBoost. It also describes a nested k-fold cross-validation scheme for tuning the number of iterations in XGBoost. However, it does not mention deep learning or its associated hyperparameters.
