Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context discusses random forests, a type of machine learning model, and feature selection using cross-validation (CV) processes. It mentions the use of bootstrap samples and random subsets of features in the random forest algorithm, but it does not provide information on handling randomness in a deep learning pipeline or setting random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
