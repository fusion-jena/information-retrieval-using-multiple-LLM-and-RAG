Answer::: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in the context of image retrieval are: 

1. Average Retrieval Precision (ARP)
2. Average Retrieval Rate (ARR)
3. F-score
4. Mean Average Precision (mAP)

Additionally, in the context of classification, the metrics used are:

1. Accuracy (Acc)
2. Specificity (Spec)
3. Sensitivity (Sen)

These metrics are used to quantify the performance of the deep learning model in the respective tasks.
