Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training. The context provides various accuracy results for different models on train, validation, and test sets, but it does not explain how the data was split into these sets. 

In general, the common practice in deep learning is to split the data into three sets: training set, validation set, and test set. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. The typical split ratio is 60-70% for the training set, 15-20% for the validation set, and 15-20% for the test set. However, this information is not provided in the given context.

Therefore, I don't know the specific criteria used to split the data in this particular case, as it is not mentioned in the provided context.
