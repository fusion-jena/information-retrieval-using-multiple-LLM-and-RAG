Answer:::
The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that the SoftGroup semantic branch was used, and the authors also mention U-Net and Deeplabv3+ as examples of deep learning models used in similar applications. But it is not clear if these models were used in the specific pipeline being described. Therefore, I don't know the exact type of deep learning model used in the pipeline.
