Answer:::

According to the provided context, the training is stopped after 90 epochs, where the learning curve converged and loss values did not decrease further. This suggests that the criterion used to determine when training is complete is the convergence of the loss values, i.e., when the loss values stop decreasing. This is often referred to as a plateau in the validation loss curve. In other words, the training is considered complete when the model's performance on the validation set stops improving.
