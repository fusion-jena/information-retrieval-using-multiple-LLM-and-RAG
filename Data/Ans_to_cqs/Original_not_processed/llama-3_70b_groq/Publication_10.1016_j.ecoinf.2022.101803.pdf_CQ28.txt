Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about deploying a deep learning model or using a specific platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud platform. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics and habitat variables, discussing datasets and models used in research papers. There is no mention of deep learning models or cloud platforms, so I cannot provide an answer to this question.
