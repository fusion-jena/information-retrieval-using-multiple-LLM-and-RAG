Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the metrics used to evaluate the performance of the classification models are Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa index. The Overall Accuracy (OA) represents the aggregate classification accuracy, and the Kappa index is used to measure the separability of the classes, with values above 1.9 denoting excellent separability. There is no mention of deep learning models in the provided context, and the metrics mentioned are used to evaluate the performance of traditional machine learning models such as MLC, SVM, ANN, and RF.
