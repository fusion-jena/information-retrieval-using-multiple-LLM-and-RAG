Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository link for the deep learning pipeline used in the study. The text only mentions that the authors used Deep Learning techniques available on Google Cloud computing, but it does not provide a link to the specific code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, or any other code repository.
