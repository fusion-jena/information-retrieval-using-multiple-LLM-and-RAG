Answer: 

The provided context does not mention model training or postprocessing steps such as Saliency maps, Metrics calculation, or Confusion matrix. The context appears to be related to the FAIRsFAIR project, which involves assessing the FAIRness of datasets using the F-UJI tool. The tool produces JSON files containing assessment results, including scores, practical tests, inputs/outputs, and assessment contexts for each of the 16 metrics. 

The postprocessing steps mentioned in the context are related to visualizing the scores and creating a report using a computational notebook (.ipynb document). The report reads the JSON responses, collects the total scores for the FAIR metric within a data frame, and visualizes the metrics and summarizes the evaluations. 

Therefore, I don't know the answer to the query as it is not related to the provided context.
