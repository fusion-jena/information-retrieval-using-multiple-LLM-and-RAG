Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline, regularization methods, dropout, or L2 regularization. The context appears to be discussing a different topic, specifically the use of Random Forest (RF) regression algorithm in the FIREMAP system for retrieving FCOVER from post-fire Sentinel-2 scenes. The RF algorithm is used for its high computational efficiency, and the hyperparameters are set to default values except for the number of trees, which is set to 500. There is no mention of deep learning or regularization methods to prevent overfitting.
