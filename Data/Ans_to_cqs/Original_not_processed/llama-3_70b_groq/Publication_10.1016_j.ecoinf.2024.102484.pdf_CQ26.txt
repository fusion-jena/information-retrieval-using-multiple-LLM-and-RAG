Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about data bias, preprocessing, or deep learning pipelines. The context appears to be related to environmental studies, discussing topics such as forest conservation, land degradation, and soil properties. There is no mention of techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline. The only mention of deep learning is in the reference "Huang, X., Han, X., Ma, S., Lin, T., Gong, J., 2019. Monitoring ecosystem service change in the City of Shenzhen by the use of high-resolution remotely sensed imagery and deep learning. Land Degrad. Dev. 30, 1490â€“1501." However, this reference does not provide information on addressing data bias during preprocessing.
