Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the AutoML procedure, which involves generating candidate models with random architectures and hyperparameters, training them on a small subset of data, and selecting the best-performing model. It does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
