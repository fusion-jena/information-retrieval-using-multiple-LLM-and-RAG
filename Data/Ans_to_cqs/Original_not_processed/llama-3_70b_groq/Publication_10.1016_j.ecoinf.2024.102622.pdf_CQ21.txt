Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does provide some information about the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the models.

From Table 4, we can see that the evaluation metrics used are R2 (coefficient of determination) and RMSE (root mean squared error). Additionally, the table also reports REP (%) which is likely the relative error percentage.

There is no mention of saliency maps, confusion matrices, or other postprocessing steps. The context primarily focuses on the performance evaluation of different machine learning models (MLR, RF, SVM, MLP, and XGboost) for estimating rice canopy coverage.

Therefore, I don't know the specific postprocessing steps involved after model training based on the provided context.
