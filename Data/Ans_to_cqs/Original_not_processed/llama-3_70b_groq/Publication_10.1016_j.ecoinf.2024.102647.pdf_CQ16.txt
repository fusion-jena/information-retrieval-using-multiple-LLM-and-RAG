Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on evaluating the performance of machine learning models using various metrics, including R2, NSE, KGE, and COR, but it does not discuss the training process or the criteria for determining when training is complete.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
