Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of the BirdNET Analyzer deep learning model for monitoring bird species by their vocalizations and the analysis of the results. It discusses the importance of confidence thresholds, precision, and recall values in the automated identification process, but it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
