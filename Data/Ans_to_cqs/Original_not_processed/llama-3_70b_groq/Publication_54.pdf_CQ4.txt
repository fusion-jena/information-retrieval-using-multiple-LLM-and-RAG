Answer::: 

The data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are:

1. Rotation 45Â°
2. Gaussian noise
3. Horizontal/vertical flipping
4. Contrast enhancement
5. Sharpening of images
6. Zoom range [0.7,1.3]
7. Affine transformations

These techniques were used to augment images of different bird species, with each species being augmented 10 times, including the original image.
