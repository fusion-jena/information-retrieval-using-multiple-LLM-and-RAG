Answer:::

Based on the provided context, it appears that the raw data for the deep learning pipeline is collected from Earth observation satellites, specifically Sentinel-2. This is inferred from the mention of Sentinel-2 in the keywords and the reference to the article "Improving cloud detection with machine learning" from Sentinel Hub. Additionally, the context mentions land cover maps and cloud masking algorithms, which suggests that the raw data is collected from satellite imagery.

There is no explicit mention of surveys or sensors being used for data collection. However, it is possible that ground truth samples are collected through field surveys or other means, as mentioned in the reference to Padial-Iglesias et al. (2021), which discusses filtering rules over ground truth samples to achieve higher accuracy in land cover maps.

It is also possible that public datasets are used, as the context mentions Zenodo, a platform for sharing and preserving research data. The reference to Steinbach et al. (2020) mentions Wetland Delineation and Characterization Layers 2014-2017, Rwanda, which is available on Zenodo.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline appear to be primarily based on Earth observation satellites, with possible supplementation from ground truth samples and public datasets.
