Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques in camera trap data analysis, species identification, and instance segmentation. It discusses the potential benefits of using bespoke neural networks for species sets and low-power neural networks in hardware, but it does not delve into the specifics of preprocessing steps.

While the context mentions various techniques and models, such as Mask R-CNN, Flow-Guided Feature Aggregation, and Scaled-YOLOv4, it does not provide information on the preprocessing steps that were applied to the data before training these models.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model in this context.
