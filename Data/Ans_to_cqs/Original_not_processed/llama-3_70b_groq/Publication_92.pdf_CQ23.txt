Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context focuses on the architecture of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the data preprocessing, and the post-processing steps, but it does not provide information on how the model's generalizability was ensured.

However, it can be inferred that the model was trained on a dataset consisting of images of fish species, which might be diverse in terms of species, lighting conditions, and other factors. Additionally, the use of a deep learning architecture like GoogLeNet, which has been shown to perform well on various image classification tasks, might also contribute to the model's generalizability.

But, without explicit information, it cannot be confirmed whether cross-validation, stratified splitting, or other techniques were used to ensure the model's generalizability.
