Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses the use of stepwise variable selection with a p-value threshold of 0.05 to select the variables with the best discriminating power, and the use of linear discriminant analysis to generate a discrimination line or hyperplane. However, it does not provide information on how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized, such as through grid search, random search, or other methods.
