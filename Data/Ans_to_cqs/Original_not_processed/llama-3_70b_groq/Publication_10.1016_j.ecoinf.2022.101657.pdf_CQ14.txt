Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It discusses various topics such as information retrieval, camera trap data, and neural networks for species identification, but it does not provide information on hyperparameter optimization techniques like grid search or random search. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
