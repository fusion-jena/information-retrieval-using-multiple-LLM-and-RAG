Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning models, specifically CNN-LSTM hybrid models, for drought assessment and prediction. It discusses the architecture of the model, the dataset used, and the advantages of the hybrid model, but it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
