Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention a strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. It discusses the bias-variance decomposition, where the hyperparameters of the heterogeneous ensemble models were set to those optimized by the TPE algorithms, and each ML model was trained on 100 different subsets generated from the original training sets using the bootstrap method. The predictions of the trained models on the testing dataset were averaged to obtain the main prediction, and the average loss, average bias, and average variance were derived for each model. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance was monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
