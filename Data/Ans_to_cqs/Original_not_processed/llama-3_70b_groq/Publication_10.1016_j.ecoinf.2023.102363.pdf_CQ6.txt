Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. It only mentions that audio data is input to the network in a novel spectrogram representation (White et al., 2022). This suggests that the audio data is converted into spectrograms, which are then used as input to the model. However, it does not provide information on any additional preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular model, as they are not mentioned in the provided context.
