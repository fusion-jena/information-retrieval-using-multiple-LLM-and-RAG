Answer:::
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is object detection and segmentation. The model used is Mask R-CNN, which is a type of object detection model that can also perform segmentation tasks. The model is composed of three main parts: the backbone, the region proposal network (RPN), and the head. The backbone is used for feature extraction, the RPN is used to generate proposals for regions of interest, and the head is used for object detection and segmentation. Additionally, the model is also used for action recognition, as mentioned in section 4.4.
