Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions a grid search for optimizing the number of trees in the Random Forest algorithm, but it does not provide information about the optimization techniques used in the YAMNet model or the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
