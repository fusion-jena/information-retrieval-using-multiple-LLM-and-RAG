Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning, regularization methods, or overfitting. The context appears to be discussing data filtering, scaling, and extraction using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and does not provide any information about deep learning pipelines or regularization methods. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
