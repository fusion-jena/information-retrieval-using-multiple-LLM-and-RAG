Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline or provide any information about where the code is available. The context discusses the use of deep learning models such as ResNet, ViT, and CA-Hybrid network for image classification and object detection in wildlife monitoring, but it does not provide any information about the code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository is available.
