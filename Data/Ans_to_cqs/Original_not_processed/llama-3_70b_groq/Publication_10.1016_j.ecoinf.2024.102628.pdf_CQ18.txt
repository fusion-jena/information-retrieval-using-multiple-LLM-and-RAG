Answer:::
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is cross-validation. Specifically, three transects (~17% of the data) are excluded for testing in each iteration, one from each target class - "Plateau", "White-sand", and "Riparian". Additionally, a cumulative evaluation is performed by assessing the model using the coefficient of determination (R2) between true vs predicted for all 648 multitemporal transects predictions.
