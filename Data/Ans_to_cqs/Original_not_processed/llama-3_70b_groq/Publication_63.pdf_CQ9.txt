Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is stored. It mentions various datasets and databases, such as iNaturalist and TRY, but does not provide information on where the pipeline's data is hosted. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific repository where the data is available.
