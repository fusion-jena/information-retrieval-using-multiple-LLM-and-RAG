Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of a deep learning pipeline, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. The context primarily focuses on big data processing, FAIR data principles, and open science methodologies.

However, it does mention that workflow can compensate for some biases through data classification and spatio-temporal aggregation, mainly when large input datasets are used. Additionally, it highlights the importance of using statistically significant data and selecting the most appropriate spatial resolution for the analysis to improve the precision of the workflow's output.

It does not provide specific information on techniques used to address data bias in deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
