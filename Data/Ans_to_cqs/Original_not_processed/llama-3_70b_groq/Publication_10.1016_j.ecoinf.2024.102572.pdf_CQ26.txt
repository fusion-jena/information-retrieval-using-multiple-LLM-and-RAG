Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning techniques for land use and land cover classification, fire damage assessment, and carbon emission quantification. It does not provide information on data preprocessing or bias handling techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
