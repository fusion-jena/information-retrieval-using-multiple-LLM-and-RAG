Answer: I don't know.

The provided context appears to be a list of references related to remote sensing, ecology, and agriculture, but it does not mention data augmentation techniques or deep learning pipelines. The references seem to focus on topics such as hyperspectral imaging, vegetation indices, and machine learning applications in agriculture and ecology. There is no mention of specific data augmentation techniques like flipping, rotating, or scaling, which are commonly used in computer vision and deep learning applications. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
