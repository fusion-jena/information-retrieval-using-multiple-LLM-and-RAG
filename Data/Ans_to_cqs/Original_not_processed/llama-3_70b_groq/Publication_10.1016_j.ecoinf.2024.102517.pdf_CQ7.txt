Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the experimental setting, comparative algorithms, and the framework of the bird sound noise reduction network based on deep feature loss. It does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the given context.
