Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline is available. The context discusses various research papers and studies related to remote sensing, geospatial analysis, and mining detection, but it does not provide information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine the specific repository where the data is available.
