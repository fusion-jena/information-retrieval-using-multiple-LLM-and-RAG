Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate or optimizer. The context discusses the application of machine learning and deep learning algorithms to hyperspectral data for predicting water quality parameters, but it does not provide details on the hyperparameters used in the models. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
