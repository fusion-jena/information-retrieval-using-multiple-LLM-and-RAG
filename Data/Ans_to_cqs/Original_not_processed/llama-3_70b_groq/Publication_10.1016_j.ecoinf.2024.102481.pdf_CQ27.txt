Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a trained deep learning model, nor does it discuss model serialization or platform selection. The text primarily focuses on the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques, specifically Random Forests (RF), in reproductive biology, particularly in classifying maturity in Chilean hake. It discusses the accuracy of RF in classifying immature and mature-inactive females and its potential in improving biological understanding. However, it does not provide information on deploying a trained deep learning model.
