Answer:::
Answer: The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the description of the CNNFAST network architecture, which consists of two convolution layers (Conv1 and Conv2) followed by max pooling layers and a fully connected layer. Additionally, the CNNFULL model is also mentioned, which consists of three convolution and max pooling layers followed by one fully connected layer.
