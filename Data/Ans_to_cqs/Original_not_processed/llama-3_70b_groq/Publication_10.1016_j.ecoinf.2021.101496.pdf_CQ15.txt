Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD or Adam. The text only mentions that the artificial neural network (ANN) was constructed empirically and that a random number generator was used for numerical optimization of the model. However, it does not provide details on the specific optimization techniques employed. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
