Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository where the deep learning pipeline's data is stored. It mentions various sources such as GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility), which is a platform for sharing biodiversity data, but it does not indicate that the data repository of the deep learning pipeline is available there. The context also cites various research papers and websites, but none of them provide information about the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot determine where the data repository is available.
