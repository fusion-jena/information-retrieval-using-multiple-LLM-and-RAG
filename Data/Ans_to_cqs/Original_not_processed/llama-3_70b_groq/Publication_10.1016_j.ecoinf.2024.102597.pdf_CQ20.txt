Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the use of deep learning models, but it does mention the training of machine learning models. According to the text, a GPU was not used for training the models. The text states: "the training and hyperparameter optimisation times for CatBoost were significantly longer than those of the other models, which may be due to the complex internal feature processing of the model and the fact that we did not use a GPU for training." This implies that the training was done on a CPU. There is no mention of TPUs or any other specific hardware resources being used.
