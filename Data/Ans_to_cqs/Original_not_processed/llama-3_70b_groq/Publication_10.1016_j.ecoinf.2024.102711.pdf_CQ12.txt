Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline. It only mentions that AutoGluon, an open-source AutoML library, is used, which emphasizes advanced data processing, deep learning, and ensemble techniques. However, it does not specify the type of deep learning model, such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer, used in the pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
