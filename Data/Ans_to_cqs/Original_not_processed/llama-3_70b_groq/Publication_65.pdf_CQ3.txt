Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context primarily focuses on the performance comparison of different deep learning architectures (DeepLabV3+, FCN, U-Net, and SegNet) for semantic segmentation tasks in a Cerrado urban environment. It discusses the architectures, their performance metrics, and the number of parameters and processing time required for each model. However, it does not provide information on the data annotation techniques used in the pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
