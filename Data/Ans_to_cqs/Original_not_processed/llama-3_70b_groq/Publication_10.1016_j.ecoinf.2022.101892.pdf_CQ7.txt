Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training is a five-fold subject-exclusive (SE) approach. This means that the data is split into five folds, and each fold is divided into training and testing sets in a way that ensures the same subject does not appear in both the training and testing sets at the same time. This approach is used to eliminate the influence of individuals and prevent overfitting.
