Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the data is in a numerical format, possibly in a CSV file. 

The context mentions the use of a MinMaxScaler to preprocess the data, which is typically used to scale numerical features to a common range. Additionally, the LSTM model is configured with a specific number of input neurons (Ni) and output neurons (No), suggesting that the data is in a numerical format. 

There is no mention of image, audio, or video data formats, which are commonly used in deep learning applications. Therefore, it can be concluded that the data format used in this pipeline is likely a numerical format, possibly in a CSV file.
