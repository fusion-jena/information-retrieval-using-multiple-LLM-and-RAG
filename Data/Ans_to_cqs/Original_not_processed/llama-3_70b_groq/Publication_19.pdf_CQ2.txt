Answer:::
Answer: The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. This is evident from the context, which mentions "images retrieved from camera traps" and "camera trap images" being classified using deep learning models such as Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, and DenseNet-121. The input image size for each model is also specified in Table II, further confirming that image data is used in the pipeline. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats being used in the pipeline.
