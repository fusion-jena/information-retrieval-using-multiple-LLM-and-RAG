Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the SPG framework, point cloud partition, and segmentation using PointNet and GRU, as well as model training and result output. It does not discuss data preprocessing or bias mitigation techniques.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
