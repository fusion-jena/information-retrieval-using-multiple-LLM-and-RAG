Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention how the hyperparameters of the Random Forest (RF) model are optimized. It discusses the application of RF for classifying maturity stages in fish, the advantages of using RF over traditional statistical methods, and the importance of considering covariates that influence the reproductive process. However, it does not provide information on the specific optimization method used for hyperparameter tuning, such as grid search or random search.
