Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is semantic segmentation, specifically for predicting forest canopy cover. This is mentioned in the text as "the application of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for semantic segmentation has also been investigated across various types of young vegetation cover" (Cameron et al., 2022).
