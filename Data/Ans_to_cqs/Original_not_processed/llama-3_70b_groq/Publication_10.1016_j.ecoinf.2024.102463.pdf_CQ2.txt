Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the data formats used in the deep learning pipeline. The context discusses the architecture of the neural network, hyperparameters, and the problem domain (reconstructing caesium-137 chronics particulate concentration in rivers), but it does not specify the input data format. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
