Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the training process and architecture of Mask R-CNN, a specific deep learning model, and provides details on the model's configuration, hyperparameters, and performance metrics. It does not discuss preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning.

However, it is common practice in deep learning to perform certain preprocessing steps before training a model. These steps may include:

* Normalization: scaling the input data to a common range, usually between 0 and 1, to prevent features with large ranges from dominating the model.
* Scaling: resizing images to a fixed size, which is the case in this context, where the image shape is fixed at [a, 640, 640, 3].
* Cleaning: handling missing values, removing noise, or correcting errors in the data.

Without further information, it is impossible to determine the specific preprocessing steps used in this particular case.
