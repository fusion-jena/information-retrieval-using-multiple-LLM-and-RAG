Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline or random seed values. The context primarily focuses on the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for water quality prediction and algal bloom analysis in lakes, and discusses the integration of remote sensing data and environmental factors in the analysis. It does not provide any information on the specific strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
