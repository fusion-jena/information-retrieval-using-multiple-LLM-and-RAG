Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning models, such as the learning rate, optimizer, batch size, etc. The context only discusses the selection of deep learning models, their architectures, and their performance on the dataset. It provides information on the dataset splitting, model selection, and their performance metrics (precision, recall, F1 score), but it does not provide information on the hyperparameters used in the models.
