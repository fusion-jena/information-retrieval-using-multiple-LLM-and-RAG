Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. The text discusses the use of different machine learning models (Lasso, LSTM, and RF) and the impact of pre-selection and the signature method on their performance, but it does not provide information on the hyperparameter optimization approach used.

However, it is worth noting that the reference to Azedou et al. (2023) mentions "hyperparameters optimization approaches for deep neural network (DNN)" in the title, suggesting that the paper may discuss different optimization methods, such as grid search or random search, but this information is not provided in the given context.

In summary, based on the provided context, I don't know how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized.
