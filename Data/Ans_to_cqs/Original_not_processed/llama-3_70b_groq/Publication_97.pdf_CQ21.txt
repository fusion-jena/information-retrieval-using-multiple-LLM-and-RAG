Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the preparation of training and validation data, the training process, and references to various research papers and techniques. It does not provide information on the specific postprocessing steps, such as generating saliency maps, calculating metrics, or creating a confusion matrix, that are typically performed after model training.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
