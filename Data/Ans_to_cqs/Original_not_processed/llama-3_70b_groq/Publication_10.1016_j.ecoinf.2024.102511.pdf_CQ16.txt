Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as validation loss plateau. The context primarily focuses on the importance of automated classification routines, the potential of BANTER for machine learning classification, and the challenges of confidently determining species identity in acoustic classification models. It does not provide information on the specific criteria used to determine the completion of training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
