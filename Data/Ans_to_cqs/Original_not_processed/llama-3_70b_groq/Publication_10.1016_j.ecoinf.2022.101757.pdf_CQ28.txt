Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It mentions the use of DeeplabV3+ with COCO classes and Conditional Random Fields, and provides a link to a GitHub repository (https://github.com/zllrunning/deeplab-pytorch-crf) where the implementation of DeeplabV3+ is available. However, it does not provide information about the platform used to deploy the model. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
