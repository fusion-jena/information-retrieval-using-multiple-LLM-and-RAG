Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context only mentions that the recordings for each ROI were cut using start/stop times and sequentially appended to create a single merged .wav file for each species and set (i.e., train, validation) combination. However, it does not provide information on how the data was split into training, testing, and validation sets.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
