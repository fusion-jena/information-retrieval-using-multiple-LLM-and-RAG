Answer: 

The context does not mention the use of deep learning models such as CNN, RNN, or Transformer in the pipeline. Instead, it mentions the use of hybrid models, specifically XGBoost and LightGBM, which are tree-based models used for regression tasks. These models are not deep learning models, but rather traditional machine learning models that are used for handling tabular data.
