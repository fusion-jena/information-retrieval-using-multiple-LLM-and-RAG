Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or any cloud platform such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. The context appears to be related to a research study on the impact of urban development on species distribution, using machine learning models and environmental variables. The study uses various machine learning models, including Generalized Linear Model (GLM), Random Forest (RF), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), but it does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or any specific platform. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
