Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the methods used for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. The context focuses on the technical aspects of the model, including the use of RNNs, transfer learning, and various neural network architectures such as ResNet-50, InceptionV3, and InceptionResNetV2. It also discusses the importance of model parameters and layers, but it does not provide information on data collection methods. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
