Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific code repository or provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository. The context discusses deep learning approaches, computer vision, and their applications in the field of fisheries, but it does not provide information about a specific code repository. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
