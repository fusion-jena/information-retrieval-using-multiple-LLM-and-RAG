Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in deep learning pipelines, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, atmospheric corrections, and water quality monitoring, but it does not provide information about data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
