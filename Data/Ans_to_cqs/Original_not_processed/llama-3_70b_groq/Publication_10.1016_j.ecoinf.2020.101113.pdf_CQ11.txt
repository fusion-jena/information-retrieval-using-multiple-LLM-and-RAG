Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the development and evaluation of a pipeline for acoustic monitoring using deep learning, but it does not provide information about where the data or the pipeline itself is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
