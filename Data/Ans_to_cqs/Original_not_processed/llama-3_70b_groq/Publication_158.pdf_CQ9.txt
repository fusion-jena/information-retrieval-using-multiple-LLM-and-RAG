Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the data repository of the deep learning pipeline. It discusses the experimental setup, CNN architectures, and training strategies, but it does not provide information about where the data or the pipeline is stored or shared. Therefore, I cannot determine the data repository of the deep learning pipeline based on the given context.
