Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed values. The context appears to be focused on discussing the performance of models in various applications, including object detection, clustering, and forest inventory parameters. 

It does not provide information on how randomness is handled in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
