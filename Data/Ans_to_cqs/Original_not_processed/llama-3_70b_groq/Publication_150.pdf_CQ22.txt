Answer:::

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are:

1. Top-1 accuracy
2. Top-2 accuracy
3. Top-3 accuracy
4. Top-4 accuracy
5. Top-5 accuracy
6. Macro recall
7. Macro precision

These metrics are used to compare the performance of different models, including Wide-ResNet101, InceptionV3, ResNet101, and MnasNet-A1. The top-k accuracy metrics measure the proportion of test images that are correctly classified among the top k predicted classes. The macro recall and macro precision metrics provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance by considering the average recall and precision across all classes.
