Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a collection of references and snippets related to probability, statistics, data mining, and agriculture, but it does not provide information about deep learning or random seed values.

The references provided are mostly academic papers and book chapters on topics such as probability and random processes, crop yield modeling, data mining, and artificial intelligence. There is no mention of deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
