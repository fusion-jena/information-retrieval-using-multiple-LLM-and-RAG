Answer::: 

The provided context does not mention any specific data augmentation techniques applied in the deep learning pipeline, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. The context primarily focuses on the use of Elastic Net-Stacked Autoencoder (EN-SAE) and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for classifying fish from different families based on DNA barcode sequences. It discusses the importance of addressing overfitting in small datasets and the benefits of using Elastic Net for sparse connection and reducing training time. However, it does not provide information on data augmentation techniques. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
