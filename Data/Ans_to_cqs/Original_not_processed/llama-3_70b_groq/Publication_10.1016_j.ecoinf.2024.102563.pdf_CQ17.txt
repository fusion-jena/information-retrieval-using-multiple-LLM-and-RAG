Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be related to remote sensing, soil mapping, and land use classification using machine learning algorithms like ANN, SVM, and RF, but it does not provide information about deep learning or regularization techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
