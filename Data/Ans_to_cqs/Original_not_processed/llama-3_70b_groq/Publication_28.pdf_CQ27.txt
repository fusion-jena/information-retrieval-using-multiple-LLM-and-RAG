Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process of deploying a trained deep learning model, such as model serialization or platform selection. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning techniques for satellite image classification, including the use of VAE models, convolutional neural networks, and graph neural networks. It also discusses the structure and training of these models, but it does not provide information on the deployment process. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the given context.
