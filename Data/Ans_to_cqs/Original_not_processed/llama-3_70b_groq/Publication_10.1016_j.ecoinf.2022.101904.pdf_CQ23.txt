Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. The context primarily focuses on the performance evaluation of different deep learning models (e.g., Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer, CoAtNet) for wetland mapping and the impact of data split on the final accuracy. It does not provide information on the dataset characteristics, data preprocessing, or model evaluation strategies that could ensure generalizability. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
