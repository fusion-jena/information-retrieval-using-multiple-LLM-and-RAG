Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SnNR), Success Ratio (SR), and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR). 

SnNR is calculated as 10log10((S + N)/N), where S is the signal and N is the noise. SR is calculated as log10(var(Noriginal) / var(Ndenoised)), which measures the change in variance of the original and denoised signal. PSNR is calculated as 20log10(MAXsig / âˆšMSE), which is the ratio between the maximum signal power and the noise floor.

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in noise reduction tasks, specifically in bioacoustics applications. They provide a way to quantify the improvement in signal quality after applying the noise reduction methods.
