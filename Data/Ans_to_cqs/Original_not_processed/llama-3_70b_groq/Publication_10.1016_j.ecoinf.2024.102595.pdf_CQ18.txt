Answer:::

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is hyper-parameter tuning via GridSearchCV with cross-validation (cv = 10). This approach allows for the evaluation of the model's performance on the validation set during the training process, enabling the identification of the optimal hyper-parameters that result in the best performance. The use of cross-validation with 10 folds further ensures that the model is evaluated on multiple subsets of the data, providing a more comprehensive assessment of its performance.
