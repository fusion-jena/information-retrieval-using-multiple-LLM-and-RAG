Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the postprocessing steps involved after the model training are:

1. Metrics calculation: The performance metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score are calculated to evaluate the model's performance.

2. Confusion matrix: A confusion matrix is generated to visualize the prediction results, as shown in Table 5. The confusion matrix provides a summary of the correct and incorrect predictions made by the model.

3. Model optimization results: The optimization results are visualized, as shown in Fig. 9, to illustrate the performance of the model.

4. Performance test: A performance test is conducted to evaluate the model's performance, as shown in Fig. 8.

No mention of Saliency maps is found in the provided context. Therefore, it is unclear if Saliency maps are involved in the postprocessing steps.

Note that the context does not provide a comprehensive list of postprocessing steps, and the answer is based on the information available in the provided context.
