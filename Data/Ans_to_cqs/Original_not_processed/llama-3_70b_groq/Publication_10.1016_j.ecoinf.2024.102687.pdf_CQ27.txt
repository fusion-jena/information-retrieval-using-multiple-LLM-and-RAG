Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the experimentation and training of the models, including the fine-tuning of CNN backbones, estimation of energy consumption, and parameter estimation of the latent space dimensionality. However, it does not provide information on how the trained model was deployed. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
