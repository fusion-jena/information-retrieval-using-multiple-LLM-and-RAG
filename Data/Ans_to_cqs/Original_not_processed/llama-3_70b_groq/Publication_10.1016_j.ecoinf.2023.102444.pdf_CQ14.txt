Answer: The provided context does not explicitly mention how the hyperparameters of the model are optimized. It only mentions that the hyperparameters of UMAP, specifically the number of neighbors and minimum distance, were maintained at fixed levels for this study. It also suggests that further analysis should be undertaken to assess how hyperparameter calibration affects the performance of the model. Therefore, it is not possible to determine how the hyperparameters are optimized based on the provided context.
