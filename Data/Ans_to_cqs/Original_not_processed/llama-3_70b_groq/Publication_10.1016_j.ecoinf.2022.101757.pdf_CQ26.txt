Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on semantic segmentation, Conditional Random Fields (CRF), and metric extraction. It discusses the use of CRF to capture fine details and compensate for the limited performance of nets in generating precisely delineated objects. However, it does not provide information on addressing data bias during preprocessing.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific query based on the provided context. The mentioned techniques, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, and Diverse data collection, are common methods used to address data bias, but they are not mentioned in the given context.
