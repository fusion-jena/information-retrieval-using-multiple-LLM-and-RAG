Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention any preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning. The context primarily focuses on hyperparameter optimization using the TPEBO algorithm, specifically for LSTM models, and does not discuss preprocessing steps. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
