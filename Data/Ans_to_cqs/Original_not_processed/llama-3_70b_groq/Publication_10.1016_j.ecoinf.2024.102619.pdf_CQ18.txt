Answer: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is cross-validation (CV). This is evident from Table 5, which reports the mean cross-validation (CV) accuracy and final training accuracy for each classifier. Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample. The goal of cross-validation is to evaluate how the results of a model will generalize to an independent data set. In this case, the mean CV accuracy provides an estimate of the model's performance during training.
