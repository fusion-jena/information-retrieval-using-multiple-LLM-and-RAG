Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. The context discusses various topics such as land cover/land use classification, El Ni√±o southern oscillation, atmospheric teleconnections, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), but it does not provide information about the hardware resources used for training the model. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query.
