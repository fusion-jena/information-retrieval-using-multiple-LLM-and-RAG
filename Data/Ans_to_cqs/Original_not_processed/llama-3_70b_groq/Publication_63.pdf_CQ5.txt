Answer:::
Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. The text mentions the use of a dataset of plant photographs from the iNaturalist database, but it does not specify a particular dataset like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. The focus of the study appears to be on predicting plant functional traits from RGB photographs, and the dataset used is likely a custom dataset of plant images.
