Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline. It only mentions that the model is trained on reference data patches of size 15 × 15 pixels, where a patch is only considered for training if the center pixel is forested. The forested pixels are determined based on vegetation points (points with 𝐷𝑧 > 1.3 m) and NIBIO’s Norway-wide timber volume map. 

There is no mention of bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the specific data annotation techniques used in this pipeline based on the provided context.
