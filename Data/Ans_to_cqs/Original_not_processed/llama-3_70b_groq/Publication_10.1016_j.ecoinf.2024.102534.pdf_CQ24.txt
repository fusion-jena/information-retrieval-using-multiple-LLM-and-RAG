Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning or strategies to handle randomness in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to a study on predicting suitable areas for orchids in New Guinea using ensemble models combining Random Forest and Support Vector Machine algorithms. There is no mention of deep learning or random seed values. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query based on the provided context.
