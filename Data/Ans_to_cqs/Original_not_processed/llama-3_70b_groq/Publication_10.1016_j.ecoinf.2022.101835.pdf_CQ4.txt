Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques, such as flipping, rotating, or scaling, being applied in the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the optimization of machine learning models, including Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks, and Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, using the Optuna library. It discusses the hyperparameters and their ranges used for optimization, as well as the evaluation metrics used to compare the performance of the models. There is no mention of data augmentation techniques, which are typically used to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset.
