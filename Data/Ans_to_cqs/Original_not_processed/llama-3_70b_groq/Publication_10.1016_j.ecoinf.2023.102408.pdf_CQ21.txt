Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training. However, it does mention that the model performance was evaluated using three error statistics: R2, mean absolute error (MAE), and RMSE. This suggests that metrics calculation is one of the postprocessing steps involved. 

Additionally, the context does not mention saliency maps or confusion matrix as part of the postprocessing steps. It is possible that these steps were not performed or were not reported in the provided context. 

Therefore, the only postprocessing step that can be confirmed from the provided context is metrics calculation.
