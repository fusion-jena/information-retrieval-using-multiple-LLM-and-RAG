Answer:::
The provided context does not explicitly mention the deployment platform of the deep learning model. However, it does mention "https://code.earthengine.google.com/" as a data source, which suggests that Google Earth Engine might be involved in the project. But it does not necessarily imply that the deep learning model was deployed on the Google Cloud platform. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
