Answer: The performance of the deep learning model is evaluated using the following metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, area under the curve (AUC) score, and confusion matrix. These metrics are used to determine the model's ability to classify mosquitoes and a good model is characterized by high values of these predetermined performance parameters.
