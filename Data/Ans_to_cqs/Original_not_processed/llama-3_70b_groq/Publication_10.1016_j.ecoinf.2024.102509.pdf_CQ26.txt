Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in regression analysis, particularly in predicting grassland above-ground biomass. It discusses the architecture of the ANN model, the importance of the quality and quantity of the sample dataset, and the need for repeated training and testing to develop an optimal neural network.

However, it does not provide information on specific techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I cannot provide a definitive answer to this query based on the provided context.
