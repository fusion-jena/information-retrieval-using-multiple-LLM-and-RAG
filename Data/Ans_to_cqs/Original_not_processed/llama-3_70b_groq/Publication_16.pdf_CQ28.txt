Answer::: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It only mentions that the trained model is hosted using TensorFlow 2.2 and served through a public-facing website developed by the authors. There is no mention of AWS, Azure, Google Cloud platform, or any other cloud platform. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
