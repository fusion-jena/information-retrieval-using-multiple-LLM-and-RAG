Answer:::
Answer: The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned as popular datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. Instead, the context suggests that the authors have created their own dataset from orthophotos, which are divided into small labeled tiles (or image cubes) for training, validation, and testing. The training dataset consists of 80% of the data, the validation dataset consists of 20%, and the test dataset consists of two full images of 10,000 Ã— 10,000 pixels.
