Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, specifically in the context of the Wind-topo model (Dujardin and Lehning, 2022). However, it does mention cross-validation in the context of evaluating the performance of downscaling techniques. 

It is mentioned that "these biases were reflected by the cross-validations, too" and that the authors obtained 12 surfaces of the Shape extrapolation metric for both WorldClim and CHELSA, one for each month, by comparing the training data at the calibration points with the projection data over the study area. This suggests that cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance of the downscaling techniques, but it does not provide information on the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.

Therefore, I do not know the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as the use of a diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting.
