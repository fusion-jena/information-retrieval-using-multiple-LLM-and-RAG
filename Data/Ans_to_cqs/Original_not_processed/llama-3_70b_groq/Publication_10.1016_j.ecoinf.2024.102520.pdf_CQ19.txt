Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention deep learning models or frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context appears to be related to ecological informatics, agriculture, and environmental studies, with topics such as soil substrates, thermal resistance, land use, and land cover studies. There is no mention of deep learning or machine learning models, and therefore, it is not possible to determine which frameworks are used to build a deep learning model.
