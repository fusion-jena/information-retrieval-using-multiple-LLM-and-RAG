Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository link. The text appears to be a research paper or article discussing habitat suitability modeling and connectivity prediction for ungulates, and it does not contain any information about a deep learning pipeline or code repository. Therefore, I cannot provide a link to a GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket repository.
