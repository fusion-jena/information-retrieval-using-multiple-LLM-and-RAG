The provided context does not mention deep learning pipeline or regularization methods used to prevent overfitting, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context appears to be discussing data analysis and modeling of invasive species diversity using random forest (RF) models, not deep learning. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
