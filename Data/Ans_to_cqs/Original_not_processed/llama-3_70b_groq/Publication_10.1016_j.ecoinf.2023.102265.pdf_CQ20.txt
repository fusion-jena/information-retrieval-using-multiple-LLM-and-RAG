Answer:::
Answer: The context mentions that the softmax operation took 12 minutes to complete on the GPU, whereas the proposed method took approximately 1.2 minutes to complete on the CPU. Additionally, the training and validation of the classifier model were run on a basic laptop using its CPU (Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9850H, CPU clock speed = 2.60 GHz). There is no mention of TPUs being used. Therefore, the hardware resources used for training the deep learning model are CPUs and GPUs.
