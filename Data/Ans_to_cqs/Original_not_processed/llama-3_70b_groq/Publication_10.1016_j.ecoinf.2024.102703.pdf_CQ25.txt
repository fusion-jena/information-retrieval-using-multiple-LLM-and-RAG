Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model in this context is regression, specifically to predict the Total Suspended Solids (TSI) from the input features aCDOM(254) and Fn(355). The model is a three-layer back propagation (BP) artificial neural network, which is a type of regression model. The output of the model is a continuous value, which is the predicted TSI. The model is trained to minimize the error between the predicted and measured TSI values, as measured by the root-mean-square error (RMSE).
