Answer:::
Answer: The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is validation. According to the context, 70% of the data were used for training, 15% for validation, and 15% for model testing. This implies that the model's performance was monitored during training using the validation set, which is a common practice in machine learning to prevent overfitting and evaluate the model's generalization ability.
