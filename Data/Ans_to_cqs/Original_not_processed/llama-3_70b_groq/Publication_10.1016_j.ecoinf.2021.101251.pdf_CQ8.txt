Answer:::
Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It discusses data repositories, specifically ESS-DIVE, and mentions projects such as AmeriFlux, WFSFA, and NGEE-Tropics, but does not provide information about code repositories or deep learning pipelines. Therefore, I cannot determine where the code repository of the deep learning pipeline is available.
