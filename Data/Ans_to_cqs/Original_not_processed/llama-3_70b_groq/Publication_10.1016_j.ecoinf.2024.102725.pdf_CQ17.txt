Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be focused on NDVI reconstruction and vegetation cover studies, and it discusses various methods for reconstructing NDVI time series data, such as harmonic analysis, adaptive spatial-temporal tensor completion, and optimal weighted allocation. However, it does not provide information on regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization.
