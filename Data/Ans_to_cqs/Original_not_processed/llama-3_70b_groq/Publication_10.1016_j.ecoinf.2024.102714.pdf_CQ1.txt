Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods used for collecting raw data in a deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention the use of EO-data (Earth Observation data) and contextual datasets in the process of habitat mapping. It can be inferred that EO-data might be collected through satellite or aerial imagery, but the exact method is not specified.

Additionally, the context does not mention deep learning or any specific pipeline, so it's unclear if the question is directly related to the provided context. The context seems to focus on habitat mapping using EO-data and contextual information, but it does not provide details on the data collection methods.

Therefore, I don't know the exact answer to the question, and more information would be needed to provide a specific response.
