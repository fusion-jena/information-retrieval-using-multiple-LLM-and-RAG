Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it can be inferred that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data. This is evident from the figures provided, such as Fig. 1, which shows the overall methodology of automatically processing images, and Fig. 2, which displays the user interface for man-made object detection and splitting. Additionally, the text mentions the processing of high-pixels-per-image (HPP) images up to 50 MB, which further supports the conclusion that image data is being used.

There is no mention of audio or video data formats being used in the deep learning pipeline. Similarly, there is no indication of CSV data being used, as the context primarily focuses on image processing and object detection.

Therefore, the answer to the query is that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image data.
