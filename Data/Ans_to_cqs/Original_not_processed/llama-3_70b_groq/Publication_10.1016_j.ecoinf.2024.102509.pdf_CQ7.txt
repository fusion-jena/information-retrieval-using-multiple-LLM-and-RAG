Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, such as train, test, and validation sets. The context primarily focuses on the application of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in predicting variables and combining multiple data sources, as well as the importance of the quality and quantity of the sample dataset in ANN training. It also discusses the structure and training process of a Backpropagation-ANN (BP-ANN) model, but it does not provide information on data splitting criteria.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
