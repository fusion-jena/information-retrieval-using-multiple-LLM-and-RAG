Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. The context discusses the training process, model evaluation, and the availability of the DeepMeerkat executable for Mac and Windows, but it does not provide information on model serialization or platform selection for deployment.

However, it is mentioned that the author received support from Google engineers who shared code samples and answered questions on deploying machine learning models. This suggests that Google's infrastructure and tools might have been used for deployment, but the specific process is not described.

In summary, the context does not provide enough information to determine the exact process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model.
