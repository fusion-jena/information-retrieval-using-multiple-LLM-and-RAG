Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. However, it does mention the evaluation metrics used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed model, which are Accuracy (A), Precision (P), Recall (R), F1-score (F1), and Intersection over Union (IOU). The calculation formulas for these metrics are also provided.

There is no mention of saliency maps, confusion matrix, or any other postprocessing steps in the given context. Therefore, it cannot be determined what postprocessing steps are involved after the model training based on the provided information.
