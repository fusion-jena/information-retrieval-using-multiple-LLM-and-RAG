Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the deployment of a deep learning model or any related processes such as model serialization or platform selection. The context primarily focuses on the classification of input dataset combinations using different classifiers (RF, SVM, MARS) and the assessment of their accuracy. It also discusses various strategies to improve classification accuracy, such as data augmentation, post-classification, and refining the training samples. However, it does not provide information on the deployment of a trained deep learning model.
