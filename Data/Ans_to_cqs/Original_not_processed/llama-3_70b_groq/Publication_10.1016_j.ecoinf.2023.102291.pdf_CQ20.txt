Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model, such as GPUs or TPUs. However, it does mention that the model training and prediction procedures were executed on Microsoft Azure using an instance NV12s v3 with 12 vCPUs and 112 GB RAM. This suggests that the training was done on a cloud-based virtual machine with a multi-core CPU and significant memory, but it does not provide information about the use of specialized hardware accelerators like GPUs or TPUs.
