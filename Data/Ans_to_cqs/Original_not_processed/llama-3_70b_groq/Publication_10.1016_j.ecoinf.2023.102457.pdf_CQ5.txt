Answer:::

The datasets used in the deep learning pipeline mentioned in the context are:

1. YouTube-8M dataset: This dataset was used to train the VGGish model for general-purpose audio classification.
2. A human speech audio dataset: This dataset was used to train the Wav2Vec 2.0 model.
3. A dataset of bird vocalizations: This dataset was used to train the BirdNET model.

There is no mention of MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet datasets in the provided context. These datasets are commonly used for image classification tasks, whereas the context focuses on audio classification and feature extraction for acoustic discrimination.
