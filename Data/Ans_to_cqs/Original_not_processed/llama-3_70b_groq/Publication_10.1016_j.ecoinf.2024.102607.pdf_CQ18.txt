Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training. The context primarily focuses on addressing the problem of unbalanced training data in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) mapping, exploring various sampling techniques, and introducing a hexagonal random-sampling strategy along with a tile model to improve the accuracy of LULC mapping. It also discusses the effect of tile size on accuracy and presents an experimental group design. However, it does not provide information on how the model performance is monitored during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
