Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the use of a random seed value or strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline. However, it does mention some techniques that can help reduce the impact of randomness and improve the generality of the models.

One such technique is image augmentation, which involves applying random transformations to the input images, such as random rotation (≤ 100°), crop (≤ 10%), shear (≤ 30%), and horizontal flip. This helps to reduce overfitting and improve the robustness of the models.

Another technique is shuffling the images in each class (species) before splitting them into training and test groups. This helps to maintain the proportional representations of each class in the training and test groups.

While these techniques can help reduce the impact of randomness, they do not explicitly address the issue of random seed values or other sources of randomness in the deep learning pipeline. Therefore, it is unclear from the provided context what strategies are employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline.
