Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the specific platform used to deploy the deep learning model. It discusses the use of cloud computing and machine learning for invasive species monitoring, but it does not provide information about the deployment platform. The context mentions the use of Python and scikit-image for image processing, but it does not specify the cloud platform used for deployment. Therefore, I cannot determine the platform used to deploy the deep learning model.
