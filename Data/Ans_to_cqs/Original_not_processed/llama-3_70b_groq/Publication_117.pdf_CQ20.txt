Answer: The context does not explicitly mention the specific hardware resources used for training the deep learning model. However, it does mention the "parallel computing power provided by graphical processing units (GPUs)" in the introduction, which suggests that GPUs are likely used for training the model. There is no mention of TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) or any other hardware resources.
