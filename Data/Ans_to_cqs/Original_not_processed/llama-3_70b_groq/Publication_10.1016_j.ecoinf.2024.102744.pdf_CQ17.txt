Answer: 

Based on the provided context, one of the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is the Dropout layer. This is mentioned in the description of the classification network, where it is stated that "The Dropout layer is integrated to mitigate overfitting." 

However, there is no mention of L2 regularization in the provided context. It is possible that other regularization methods may be used in the pipeline, but they are not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, I can only confirm the use of Dropout as a regularization method to prevent overfitting.
