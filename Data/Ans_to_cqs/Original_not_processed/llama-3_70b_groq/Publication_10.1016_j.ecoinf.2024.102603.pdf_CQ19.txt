Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention specific frameworks used to build deep learning models, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The context discusses the differences between XGBoost and deep learning models, their architectures, and their applications, but it does not provide information about the frameworks used to build deep learning models. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question based on the given context.
