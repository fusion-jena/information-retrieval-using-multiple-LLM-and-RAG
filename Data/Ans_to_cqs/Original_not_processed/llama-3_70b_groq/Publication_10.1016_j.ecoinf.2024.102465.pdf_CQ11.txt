Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be a list of references to various academic papers and publications, but it does not provide information about a specific data repository link. The references cited are mostly from academic journals and conferences, and they do not include links to data repositories such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF. Therefore, I am unable to provide a specific answer to this query.
