Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the regularization method used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline is dropout. This is mentioned in the system structure section (2.4.4), where the model consists of an input layer, three LSTM hidden layers, one dropout layer, and one dense layer. However, there is no mention of L2 regularization or any other regularization methods in the provided context.
