Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete, such as a validation loss plateau. However, it does mention that the authors performed cross-validation by shifting the validation set 5 times to quantify the average validation cross-entropy loss and accuracy. They then used the neural network with the lowest cross-entropy loss across a range of models with different numbers of hidden layers and subsets of features.

This suggests that the authors used the cross-entropy loss on the validation set as a metric to evaluate the performance of the model and to select the best-performing model. However, it does not provide a specific criterion, such as a validation loss plateau, to determine when training is complete.
