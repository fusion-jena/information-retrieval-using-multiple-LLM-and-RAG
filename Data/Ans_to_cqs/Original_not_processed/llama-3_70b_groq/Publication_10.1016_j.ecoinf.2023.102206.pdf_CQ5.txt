Answer: 

The provided context does not mention specific deep learning datasets like MNIST, CIFAR, or ImageNet. However, it does mention other datasets such as:

* Housing dataset
* Synthetic dataset
* Email spam filtering text dataset
* Brodatz texture
* Intel Berkeley dataset
* De Montfort university robotics dataset
* Robotics laboratory data
* Glutamic acid fermentation process modeling dataset
* Multivalued (MV) data modeling dataset
* Synthetic dataset

These datasets seem to be related to various applications such as regression, transfer learning, multitask learning, and fuzzy logic. However, they are not typical deep learning datasets used for image classification tasks.
