Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning model or any measures taken to ensure its generalizability. The context appears to be discussing a different type of model, specifically a Minimum Weight Spanning Tree (MWST) model, and its application to clustering and network analysis of coral reef community data. There is no mention of deep learning, cross-validation, stratified splitting, or any other measures to ensure generalizability.
