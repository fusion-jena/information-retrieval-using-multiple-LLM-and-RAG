Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the optimization techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as SGD, Adam, or others. The context primarily focuses on the architecture and components of the classification network, object detection networks (Faster RCNN, YOLOv5), and their evaluation metrics. It does not provide information about the optimization techniques employed during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the given context.
