Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a specific data repository link for the deep learning pipeline. It provides information about the computing infrastructure, search strategy, and training duration used for training neural networks, as well as the hyperparameters used for the training of each neural network. It also describes the fish classification task and the ResNet50V2 model used for this task. However, it does not provide a link to a data repository such as Zenodo, Figshare, Dryad, or GBIF.
