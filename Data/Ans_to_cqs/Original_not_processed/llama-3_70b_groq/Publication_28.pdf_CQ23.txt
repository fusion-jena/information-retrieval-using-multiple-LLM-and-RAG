Answer::: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on presenting the experimental results of various models on the UCM and AID datasets, comparing their performance in terms of precision, recall, F1-score, and F2-score. It also briefly explains the structure and training process of the VAE model. However, it does not provide information on how the datasets were split, whether cross-validation was used, or if any other techniques were employed to ensure the generalizability of the models. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context.
