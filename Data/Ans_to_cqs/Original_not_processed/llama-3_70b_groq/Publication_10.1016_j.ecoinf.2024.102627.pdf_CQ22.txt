Answer: 

The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model are A30 and MSA30. A30 measures the percentage of test observations where the correct label is returned among the first 30 species, which is 87% in this case. MSA30 is the macro-average success rate, which measures the performance of the model when each species in the test set is given the same weight. The MSA30 metric is 0.48, indicating that the correct label is within the first 30 classes returned almost half the time. 

These metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the species assemblage predictor, which is a set-valued prediction task. The A30 metric gives prominence to common species, while the MSA30 metric is more suitable for highly imbalanced datasets and depends heavily on rare species performances.
