Answer:::
Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the hyperparameters used in the deep learning model, such as the learning rate, optimizer, or other hyperparameters. The context primarily focuses on the architecture of the model, the methodology for transferring knowledge from one dataset to another, and the experimental results. It does not provide information about the specific hyperparameters used during training. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query.
