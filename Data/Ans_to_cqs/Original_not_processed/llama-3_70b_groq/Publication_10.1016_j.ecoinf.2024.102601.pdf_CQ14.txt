Answer:::
The hyperparameters of the model are optimized using a hierarchical approach that combines both RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV. 

First, RandomizedSearchCV is used to perform a probabilistic search over the predefined hyperparameter space. This method evaluates a user-specified subset of hyperparameter combinations, offering a computational advantage when navigating vast hyperparameter spaces, especially when there is uncertainty regarding the optimal values.

Following the random search, GridSearchCV is utilized to conduct an exhaustive search in the vicinity of the best hyperparameters discovered by RandomizedSearchCV. GridSearchCV evaluates every possible combination within a predefined grid of hyperparameter values, guaranteeing that the optimal parameter combination is identified and ensuring search precision.

This hierarchical approach is employed to amalgamate the benefits of both methods, achieving an optimal balance between computational efficiency and search precision.
