Answer: The hyperparameters used in the deep learning model include a learning rate of 0.001, a batch size of 64, and ten epochs. Additionally, a grid search technique was used to tune the hyperparameters of the final model, including the number of epochs, batch size, and learning rate. However, the specific optimizer used is not mentioned in the provided context.
