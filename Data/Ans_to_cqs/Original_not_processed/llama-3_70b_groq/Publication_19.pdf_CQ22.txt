Answer: The metrics used to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in this context are accuracy and macro-F1 score. The accuracy is reported as a percentage, and the macro-F1 score is a measure of the F1 score averaged across all classes. The F1 score is a measure of the model's accuracy on a specific class, and it is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall. However, precision and recall are not explicitly reported in the provided context. The macro-F1 score is used to evaluate the model's performance on imbalanced datasets, where the number of instances in each class is not equal.
