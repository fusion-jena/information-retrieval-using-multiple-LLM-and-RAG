Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the process followed to deploy the trained deep learning model. It discusses the BirdVox-DCASE-10h dataset, transductive few-shot learning, and various machine learning systems and their architectures, but it does not provide information on model deployment. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this question.
