Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be discussing ensemble methods, specifically bagging and boosting, and their application to models such as XGBoost and random forests. It also mentions techniques for addressing overfitting and autocorrelation in datasets, but does not provide information on data annotation techniques. Therefore, I am unable to provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
