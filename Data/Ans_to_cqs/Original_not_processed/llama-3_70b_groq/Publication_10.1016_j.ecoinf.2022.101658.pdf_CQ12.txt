Answer::: 

The type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). Specifically, it is a variant of the Deeplabv3-Resnet101 network, which is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. This is mentioned in the text as "Our deep convolutional neural network uses the convolution layers of the Deeplabv3-Resnet101 network as a learned feature extractor."
