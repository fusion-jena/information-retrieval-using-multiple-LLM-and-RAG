Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention any techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline, such as Stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or Diverse data collection. However, it is mentioned that "our dataset was balanced", which suggests that the dataset may have been preprocessed to ensure class balance, but the specific technique used is not mentioned. Additionally, the context mentions that various data augmentation techniques such as height and width shift, flipping, zooming, and brightness changes were used during training, which can help reduce overfitting and improve model robustness, but these are not specifically aimed at addressing data bias.
