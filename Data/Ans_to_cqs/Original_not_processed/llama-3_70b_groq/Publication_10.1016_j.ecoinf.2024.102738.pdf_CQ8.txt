Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention a deep learning pipeline or a code repository. It appears to be related to a research study on land use and land cover (LULC) classification using Random Forest and spectral indices, but it does not provide any information about a code repository or a deep learning pipeline. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to the query.
