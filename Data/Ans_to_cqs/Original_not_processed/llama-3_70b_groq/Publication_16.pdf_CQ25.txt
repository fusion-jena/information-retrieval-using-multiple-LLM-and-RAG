Answer::: 
Answer: The purpose of the deep learning model is classification, specifically bird classification using visual and acoustic data. This is evident from Figure 12, which is titled "Bird Classification Using Visual Data", and the discussion in the MATERIALS AND METHODS section, which mentions the evaluation metrics used to evaluate the trained model, including Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity, and Specificity, which are typical metrics used in classification tasks. Additionally, the model is configured to output a number of classes equal to the number of classes in the dataset, further supporting the classification purpose.
