Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model, such as diverse dataset, cross-validation, or stratified splitting. However, it does mention that the research team took actions to address the imbalance in the training data, which occurred due to the varying areas of each forest type classification.

The actions taken include (a) inputting the original data, (b) data reduction through sampling, and (c) data augmentation using image rotation or overlapping plots to standardize the number of samples of each forest type. These actions may have helped to some extent in ensuring the generalizability of the model, but it is not explicitly stated.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it is not possible to determine the specific measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model.
