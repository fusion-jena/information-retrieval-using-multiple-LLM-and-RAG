Answer::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the measures taken to ensure the generalizability of the deep learning model. However, it does mention that the authors "validate our predictions using withheld data, producing quantitative assessment of predictive accuracy." This suggests that the authors used some form of data splitting or cross-validation to evaluate the performance of their model on unseen data. 

However, the context does not provide further details on the specific methods used, such as stratified splitting or the diversity of the dataset. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact measures taken to ensure generalizability without additional information.
