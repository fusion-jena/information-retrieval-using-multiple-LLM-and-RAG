Answer: 

Based on the provided context, it appears that the data format used in the deep learning pipeline is not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the data format is related to satellite imagery and remote sensing data, as the context discusses the use of MODIS-TERRA sensor data and Landsat data. 

It is likely that the data format is in the form of raster images or geospatial data, which are commonly used in remote sensing and satellite imagery applications. However, the exact data format (e.g., GeoTIFF, HDF, CSV) is not specified in the provided context.
