Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the specific data annotation techniques used in the deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context only mentions that human labellers were used to annotate the sounds within the audio recordings, and conflicts were resolved using a majority rule or the authors' own judgement. 

It can be inferred that the annotation technique used is some form of audio annotation, where human labellers listened to the audio recordings and labelled the sounds they heard. However, the specific technique used is not detailed in the provided context.
