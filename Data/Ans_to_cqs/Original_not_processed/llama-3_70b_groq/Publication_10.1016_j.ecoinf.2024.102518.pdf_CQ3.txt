The provided context does not mention data annotation techniques used in a deep learning pipeline, such as bounding box annotation or instance segmentation. The context appears to be related to species distribution modeling, ecological niche models, and habitat suitability analysis, but it does not provide information about deep learning or data annotation techniques. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the given context.
