Answer::: 

Based on the provided context, the type of deep learning model used in the pipeline is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). This is evident from the layer descriptions in Tables 1 and 2, which include ConvolutionLayer, BatchNormalizationLayer, Ramp (ReLU), and PoolingLayer, which are typical components of a CNN architecture. Additionally, the text mentions "Applications of deep convolutional neural networks to digitized natural..." and "Constitutive layers and tensor/vector shapes for the unstained/stained CNN" and "Constitutive layers and tensor/vector shapes for the clubmoss/spikemoss CNN", which further confirms the use of CNNs.
