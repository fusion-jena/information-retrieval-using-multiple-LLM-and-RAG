Answer:::
Answer: The data format used in the deep learning pipeline is image. This is evident from the context where it is mentioned that the endemic bird data is split into 3,132 images for training and 760 images for testing. Additionally, the use of the Inception-ResNet-v2 model, which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, further supports the use of image data. There is no mention of audio, video, or CSV data formats in the provided context.
