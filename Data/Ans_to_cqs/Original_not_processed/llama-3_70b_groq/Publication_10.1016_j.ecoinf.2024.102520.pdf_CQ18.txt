Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about model training or monitoring model performance during training. The context appears to be related to spatial analysis and kriging, discussing the nugget ratio and spatial dependency of Total Soil Nitrogen (TSN) and Total Soil Phosphorus (TSP) in different land use types. It also mentions the use of kriging variance and RMSE of residuals, but it does not provide information about the strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training.
