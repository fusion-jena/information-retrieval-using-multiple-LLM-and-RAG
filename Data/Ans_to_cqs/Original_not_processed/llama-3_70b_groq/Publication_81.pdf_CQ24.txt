Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of deep learning methods in biological networks, fish classification, and DNA barcode sequences.

However, it is worth noting that the context does mention the use of Elastic Net to address the problem of overfitting in small datasets, which can be related to handling randomness in the model. Elastic Net provides sparse connections, which can help reduce the impact of random fluctuations in the data.

Additionally, the context mentions the use of Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to select a threshold based on outgroup scores, which can also be related to handling randomness in the model. KDE is a non-parametric method that can help estimate the underlying distribution of the data, which can be useful in handling random variations.

However, these points are not directly related to handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline through strategies like setting a random seed value. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific answer to this query based on the provided context.
