Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in deep learning pipelines, such as dropout or L2 regularization. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and satellite data interpretation in aquatic environmental monitoring, specifically for estimating Chl-a concentrations. It discusses various studies and algorithms used for this purpose, but it does not provide information on regularization methods used in deep learning pipelines.
