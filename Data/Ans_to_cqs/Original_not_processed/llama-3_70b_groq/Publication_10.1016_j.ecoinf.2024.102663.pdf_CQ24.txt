Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on fish biomass estimation using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It discusses the use of Random Forest Regressor, Linear Regression, Lasso, and Ridge models, as well as the potential application of deep learning techniques like Bidirectional LSTM with GloVe embeddings and YOLO architecture modifications. 

However, it does mention the use of bootstrap sampling in the Random Forest Regressor algorithm, which involves drawing a bootstrap sample of the dataset and growing a decision tree from it. This process is repeated multiple times, and the predictions from all the trees are aggregated for the final prediction. This approach can help reduce the impact of randomness in the dataset, but it does not specifically address randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

In summary, the provided context does not provide information on strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value.
