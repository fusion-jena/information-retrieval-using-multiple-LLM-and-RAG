Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies employed to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as random seed value. The context primarily focuses on the application of machine learning and deep learning models in predicting oil palm crop yields, highlighting their potential in enhancing agricultural practices and optimizing the supply chain.

While the context mentions various machine learning and deep learning models, such as Neural Networks, Random Forest, LSTM, and Extra Trees Regressor, it does not delve into the specifics of handling randomness in the deep learning pipeline.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
