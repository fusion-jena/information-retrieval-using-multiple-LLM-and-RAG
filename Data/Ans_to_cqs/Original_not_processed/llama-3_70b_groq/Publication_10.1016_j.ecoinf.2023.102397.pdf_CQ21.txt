Answer: 

The provided context does not explicitly mention the postprocessing steps involved after model training, such as saliency maps, metrics calculation, or confusion matrix. The context primarily focuses on the data processing and analysis steps, including the creation of training, test, and target sets, and the application of the recognizer to these sets.

However, it can be inferred that some form of evaluation or performance measurement is involved, as the context mentions "to evaluate its performance" in step (7) of the data processing section. Additionally, the context mentions that the same sets were always used for each software in each step of the data processing to allow for direct comparisons, implying that some form of comparison or evaluation is being made.

Unfortunately, the specific postprocessing steps involved are not explicitly stated in the provided context. Therefore, I cannot provide a more detailed answer to this query.
