Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to determine when training is complete. The context discusses the limitations of existing models in bioacoustics, the importance of incorporating metadata, and the aim of the study to explore methods for doing so. However, it does not provide information on the specific training process or the criteria used to determine when training is complete.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this query based on the provided context.
