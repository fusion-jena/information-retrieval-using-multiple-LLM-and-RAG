Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention strategies to handle randomness in the deep learning pipeline, such as setting a random seed value. The context primarily focuses on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), their architecture, and optimization objectives. It discusses the probabilistic encoder, decoder, and the regularization term that controls the smoothness of the latent space.

However, in general, handling randomness in deep learning pipelines is crucial to ensure reproducibility and consistency in results. Some common strategies employed to handle randomness include:

1. Setting a random seed value: This ensures that the random number generator produces the same sequence of numbers, making the results reproducible.
2. Using deterministic algorithms: Some algorithms, like those used in convolutional neural networks, can be designed to be deterministic, eliminating the need for random number generation.
3. Averaging multiple runs: Running the experiment multiple times with different random seeds and averaging the results can help reduce the impact of randomness.
4. Using techniques like dropout and batch normalization: These techniques can help reduce overfitting and improve the robustness of the model to random variations.

It is essential to note that these strategies are not mentioned in the provided context, and the answer is based on general knowledge of deep learning pipelines.
