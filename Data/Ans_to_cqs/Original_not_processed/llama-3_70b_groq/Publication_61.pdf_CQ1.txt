Answer:::

The provided context does not explicitly mention the methods utilized for collecting raw data in the deep learning pipeline. However, it can be inferred that the authors built their own dataset for cactus recognition in aerial images, as they mentioned the lack of previous information and the need to build their own dataset.

It is not specified how they collected the raw data, but it can be assumed that they used aerial images, possibly obtained through aerial photography or satellite imagery. The context also mentions the importance of including more examples in the dataset, obtained under different conditions, such as different daylight conditions or different year seasons.

There is no mention of surveys, sensors, or public datasets being used for collecting raw data. The context focuses more on the importance of having a large dataset for deep learning approaches and the need to build their own dataset due to the lack of previous information.

In summary, the methods utilized for collecting raw data are not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that aerial images were used, and the authors built their own dataset.
