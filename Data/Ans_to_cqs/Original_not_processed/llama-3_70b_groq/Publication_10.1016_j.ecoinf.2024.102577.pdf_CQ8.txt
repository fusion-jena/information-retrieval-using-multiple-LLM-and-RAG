Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the code repository of the deep learning pipeline. It only describes the pipeline's building process, mentioning the use of different languages (Python, R) and the graphical interface of Weka, but it does not provide information about where the code is stored or shared. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the code repository of the deep learning pipeline.
