Answer:::

According to the provided context, the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model include:

1. Auto-orientation: This step ensures that the images are consistently oriented.
2. Resizing: The images are resized to a uniform size of 640 Ã— 640 pixels.
3. Tiling: This step is mentioned but not explicitly explained in the context.
4. Filtering: This step is also mentioned but not explicitly explained in the context.
5. Augmentation: Random saturation adjustments are introduced to each training example to increase the number of outputs per example and diversify the dataset.

There is no mention of normalization, scaling, or cleaning in the provided context. However, it is common for these steps to be included in the preprocessing phase of deep learning model training.
