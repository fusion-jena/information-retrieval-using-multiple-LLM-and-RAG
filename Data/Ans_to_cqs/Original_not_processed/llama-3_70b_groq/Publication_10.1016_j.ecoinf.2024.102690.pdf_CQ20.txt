Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about the hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. The context discusses the use of Self-Organizing Feature Maps (SOFM) for identifying ecological sources, dimensionality reduction, and clustering analysis, but it does not provide information about the specific hardware resources used for training a deep learning model. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this question based on the provided context.
