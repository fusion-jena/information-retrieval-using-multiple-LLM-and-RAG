Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention any data augmentation techniques applied in a deep learning pipeline. The context appears to be related to remote sensing and forestry, discussing the use of Sentinel-2 data and various statistical models to estimate Above-Ground Biomass Density (AGBD). There is no mention of deep learning or data augmentation techniques such as flipping, rotating, or scaling. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
