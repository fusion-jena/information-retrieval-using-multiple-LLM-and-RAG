Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training (e.g., train, test, validation). The context primarily focuses on the datasets used, data augmentation, and the training process, but it does not provide information on how the data was split for training, testing, and validation.

However, it can be inferred that the authors used a portion of the data for training and another portion for testing, as they report accuracy results for the test datasets. But the specific criteria or ratio used to split the data is not mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the exact criteria used to split the data for deep learning model training, and further information would be required to provide a more specific answer.
