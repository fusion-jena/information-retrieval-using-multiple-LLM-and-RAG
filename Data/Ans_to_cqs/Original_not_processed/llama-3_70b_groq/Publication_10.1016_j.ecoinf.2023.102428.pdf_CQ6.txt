Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the MLPnn-MC model description, LULC classification, and accuracy assessment, as well as providing information about the raster and supplementary data used in the study.

However, it can be inferred that the input data is provided to the input node and processed through the hidden layers in an iterative manner, which might imply some form of preprocessing or feature engineering. But the specific steps involved, such as normalization, scaling, or cleaning, are not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, I don't know the specific preprocessing steps involved before training the deep learning model in this context.
