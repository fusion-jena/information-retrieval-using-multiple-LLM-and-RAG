Answer: 

The strategy implemented to monitor the model performance during training is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, it can be inferred that the model performance is evaluated using standard evaluation metrics such as accuracy, macro-precision, macro-recall, and macro-F1 score. 

Additionally, the context mentions that the parameters of the basic models were exclusively updated using the training set, whereas the weights of the ensemble methods were calculated on the validation set. This suggests that the model performance is monitored on the validation set during training. 

However, the specific strategy or technique used to monitor the model performance, such as early stopping or model checkpointing, is not mentioned in the provided context.
