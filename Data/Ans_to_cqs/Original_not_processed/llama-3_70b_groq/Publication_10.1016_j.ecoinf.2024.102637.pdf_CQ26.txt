Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing of the deep learning pipeline. The context primarily focuses on the application strategies of deep learning, model complexity, and structural design. It discusses the proposal of a lightweight SIAlex model, cascading multiple activation functions, and the contributions of the study. Additionally, it provides references to various research papers on deep learning models, feature extraction, and classification.

However, it does not provide information on techniques used to address data bias during preprocessing, such as stratified splitting, oversampling, undersampling, or diverse data collection. Therefore, I don't know the answer to this specific question based on the provided context.
