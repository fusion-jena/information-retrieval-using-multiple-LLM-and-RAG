Answer: 

Unfortunately, the provided context does not mention the postprocessing steps involved after the model training. The context primarily focuses on the model training process, including the hyperparameters used, the dataset, and the results obtained. It does not provide information on what happens after the model training is complete.

Therefore, I don't know the answer to this question based on the provided context. It is possible that the postprocessing steps may include saliency maps, metrics calculation, confusion matrix, or other techniques, but this information is not available in the given context.
