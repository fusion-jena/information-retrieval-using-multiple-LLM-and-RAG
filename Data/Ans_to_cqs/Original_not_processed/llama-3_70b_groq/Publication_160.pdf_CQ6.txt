Answer:::

Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention the preprocessing steps involved before training a deep learning model. The context primarily focuses on the performance of different ResNet architectures on a classification task, discussing batch sizes, network depths, and input sizes. It also mentions the use of pre-trained weights from the ImageNet challenge and the replacement of the top fully-connected layer with a new layer using ReLU activation, dropout, and softmax layers.

However, it can be inferred that some form of preprocessing might have been performed, as the context assumes the availability of a dataset for training and testing the models. Typically, preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and cleaning are essential for preparing the data before feeding it into a deep learning model.

Unfortunately, without more information, it is impossible to determine the specific preprocessing steps involved in this particular case.
