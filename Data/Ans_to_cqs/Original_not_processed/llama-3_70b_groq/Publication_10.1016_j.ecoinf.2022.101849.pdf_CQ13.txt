Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention the use of a deep learning model or its hyperparameters. The text discusses weakly supervised learning tasks, specifically in the context of regression with structurally incomplete target labels. It also mentions a case study on predictive modeling of global vegetation cover, but it does not provide details on the specific machine learning methods or models used. Therefore, it is not possible to determine the hyperparameters used in a deep learning model, as this information is not provided in the context.
