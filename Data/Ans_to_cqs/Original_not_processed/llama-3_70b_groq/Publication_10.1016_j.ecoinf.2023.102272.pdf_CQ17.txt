Answer: 

Based on the provided context, the regularization methods used to prevent overfitting in the deep learning pipeline are not explicitly mentioned. However, it is mentioned that the model selection procedure involves training the models with a small subset of the training data for 4 epochs and then selecting the model with the highest performance. This suggests that the authors may have used early stopping as a regularization method to prevent overfitting.

Additionally, the context mentions "hidden_dropout" and "visible_dropout" as parameters in the deep neural network (DNN) model, which suggests that dropout regularization may have been used. However, there is no mention of L2 regularization or any other regularization methods.

Therefore, based on the provided context, it can be inferred that dropout regularization may have been used, but it is not explicitly confirmed. The use of other regularization methods, such as L2 regularization, cannot be determined from the provided context.
