Answer: I don't know.

The provided context does not mention anything about training completion criteria, such as validation loss plateau. The context appears to be discussing a specific dataset called Potapov30m, its derivation, and its validation using ALS data. It also mentions various research papers and studies, but none of them seem to relate to the query about training completion criteria. Therefore, I cannot provide an answer to this query based on the provided context.
